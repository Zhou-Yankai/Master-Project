Upcoming iPad Pro & iPad Air Delayed,2024-04-01T22:38:00+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/upcoming-ipad-pro-ipad-air-delayed/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=upcoming-ipad-pro-ipad-air-delayed,"For those counting down the days for the arrival of the upcoming 2024 Apple iPad Pro and Air, it seems they may have to wait a bit longer. Currently, there have been rumours of a reveal in late March or early April, however, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, this likely won’t happen. In his latest report, Gurman claims the upcoming tablets should be revealed in early May, citing the sped up production at Apple’s suppliers. Production-related challenges are reportedly the cause of the pushed back launch. “Apple had planned to release the new iPads by the end of March or early April, but the company has been working to finish software for the devices. The screens in the latest models also require complex new manufacturing techniques, which have contributed to the delay.” All four trims will be relying on the new M3 silicon, which currently powers a range of MacBooks. The biggest change will arrive on the iPad Air, as Apple is planning a 12.9-inch version. iPad Pro models will receive an OLED display upgrade, however, it remains unclear if this will be reserved for the large-screen version only, or the 11-inch model as well.  The 12.9-inch iPad Pro will be equipped with a mini-LED screen, and the smaller version will come with an LCD panel. It’s unclear if a design revision is in the pipeline, however, new keyboard accessories are claimed to be on the table. The most interesting part will be the software, and how the M3 silicon handles AI. Apple are currently claimed to be considering a Gemini Nano licencing deal with Google. The company has also claimed the M3 silicon is capable of running various language models, and tasks such as Stable Diffusion-driven image creation. The M3 silicon comes with added AI features, and a price hike is likely, due to the upgrades planned. The RAM and storage situation is similar across the iPad Pro and MacBook Air, meaning there should be some new on-device AI-driven experiences at least.   02 9002 5900   [email protected] Level 1, 275 Alfred Street

 Beyoncé recently released her highly anticipated album Cowboy Carter on March 29, and it has already broken records. The album has become Spotify’s most-streamed album in a single day so far in 2024, and the first country album of the year to reach that milestone.  Additionally, on Apple Music, Cowboy Carter has earned the most first-day streams than any of Beyoncé’s previous albums. It has also earned the most first-day streams for a country album by a female performer.  Beyoncé’s collaborators and inspirations, as well as artists who just love the album, have been sharing their thoughts on Cowboy Carter recently. Nancy Sinatra spoke about “These Boots Are Made For Walking” being sampled on “Ya Ya,” posting about it on social media.  [RELATED: Inspired By Beyoncé, Levi’s Changes Their Name to Match ‘Cowboy Carter’ Track] “To have a little piece of one of my records in a Beyonce song is very meaningful to me because I love her,” Sinatra wrote on Twitter/X. “She represents what is great about today’s music and I’m delighted to be a tiny part of it. This may be the best sample of ‘Boots’ yet! And the beat goes on…” June Carter Cash’s daughter also fiercely defended Beyoncé from haters after the album dropped. “I’ve caught wind of some negativity over the release of Beyoncé’s ‘Cowboy Carter,’ her new country album. As a Carter Girl myself and coming from a long line of Carter Girls, I’m moved to ask why anyone would treat a Carter this way?” Carter Cash wrote on social media.  She continued, “I am here to let Beyoncé and to all those nay sayers know that I admire and love her and all she does. I am delighted to know that Carter spunk is in her just like it’s been through nearly 100 years of us Carters choosing to follow ours hearts, hearts that are filled with love not just for country music but for all kinds of music.” Additionally, RAYE, who co-wrote the song “Riiverdance,” shared love on social media as well. “What an honour it is to being able to contribute my small piece to this beautiful album, and to THE [Beyoncé] who continues to inspire all of us,” she wrote.

"NYC Council outlines budget response to fund library services, free 3K programs",2024-04-01T20:50:29+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/04/01/us-news/nyc-council-outlines-budget-response-to-fund-library-services-3k/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 The New York City Council unveiled its budget proposal on Monday — with calls for the Big Apple to keep libraries open on weekends and fully fund free 3K programs. “The city has the resources to protect essential investments into New Yorkers while safeguarding our fiscal health, and prioritizing both goals is the path to a safer, healthier, and more stable city,” said Council Speaker Adrienne Adams in a statement. The legislative body’s budget response comes months after Mayor Eric Adams, no relation to the speaker, presented his $109.4 billion budget for fiscal year 2025 — with a dire warning that dwindling federal COVID stimulus funds could lead to cuts to some programs, including 3K and other schooling initiatives. But council leadership said there was $3.35 billion more in incoming tax revenue that City Hall had not accounted for, which would allow the Big Apple to fund those programs and others. Among the top takeaways in the council’s budget response are $1.63 billion in funding restorations, which include: “It’s not a wish list but rather a vision for the city’s budget that fulfills our obligations to New Yorkers,” Speaker Adams said during a City Hall press conference. The council’s budget proposal also calls for the reversal of cuts to programs it says have been proven to reduce recidivism, including “Alternatives to Incarceration” and supervised release, as well as an extra $9 million for mental health courts and diversion programs for district attorneys. “The city has a responsibility to invest in programs that are shown to reduce recidivism rather than cutting them,” Speaker Adams told reporters. “The solutions are in our grasp, but they need the city support and funding. This is critical to make our communities safer.” The council and mayor’s office have been at loggerheads over the city’s revenue projections as they balance the budget with the $10 billion migrant crisis.   City Hall has railed that the council’s expectations were too high while the lawmakers have criticized the administration for being far too conservative.  “New York City has record reserves and steady tax growth overall,” Council Finance Chair Justin Brannan (D-Brooklyn) said Monday. “We maintain that the administration’s blunt cuts were never necessary in the first place, and will be fighting for and expecting to see full restoration.” In a statement, a City Hall spokesperson defended the mayor’s proposed budget, adding, “We look forward to working with the City Council to negotiate a budget that reflects our shared priorities that keeps the city safe, clean, and a welcoming place to live, work, and raise a family.” Advertisement",0
"Apple Vision Pro is on sale for the first time ever, but there's a catch",2024-04-01T20:47:02+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-vision-pro-is-on-sale-for-the-first-time-ever-but-theres-a-catch/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular 'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean?

Had your eye on the Apple Vision Pro but apprehensive about the price? You're not alone. Apple's flagship VR headset starts at a steep $3,499 -- that's the price of seven Meta Quest 3s -- but is currently on sale for the first time, bringing its price down to $3,299.  The $200-off deal price is available exclusively on Woot by Amazon, and does come with a catch. It only applies to the 256GB model with the Solo Knit Band and Dual Loop Band in small or medium sizes. If you need the largest size, the deal would essentially cancel out the savings.  If the sizing works for you, however, the $200 off could be just the savings you're looking for to spring for the deal. Despite the price point, Apple reportedly sold 200,000 units in the first 10 days the headset was on the market, according to MacRumors. Now, two months after its release date, we're seeing its first sale, allowing more potential users a shot at owning the Vision Pro's interactive digital experience. The Vision Pro is shaping up to be one of the most talked about products of 2024, and an integral part of driving the next stage of what is being called the immersive internet.

Chinese Smartphone Brands May Lag Behind A Generation Due To AI – Analysis,2024-04-02T23:30:14+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdlvtubh-2oQabel3Iu4GjH,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   By Anbound  By Kung Chan and Xia Ri Recently, there have been reports that Apple is in discussions with Google on a large-scale collaboration agreement that could redefine the rules of the artificial intelligence industry by integrating Google’s Gemini artificial intelligence (AI) engine into the iPhone. There are also reports suggesting that this exposes Apple’s progress in AI may not be as smooth as expected, while also potentially exacerbating the antitrust scrutiny faced by both companies. There are various opinions surrounding such an issue, with some industry giants expressing concerns; some of these opinions are sensational while others are imaginative. However, this matter is actually corresponding to the terminal model for the future AI era of laptops previously established by ABOUND’s founder Mr. Kung Chan. This model includes features such as natural language replacing keyboards, intense competition between two major operating systems, hardware design templates trending towards the iPad, further intelligentization in software devices, and primary supporting devices being headphones and various wireless broadband interfaces. Based on this model, Mr. Kung Chan believes that Chinese smartphone brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi may fall behind a generation due to AI, becoming not unlike Nokia phones in the past. Firstly, AI development in China is lagging behind the productization trend. During the initial stage, large-scale model enterprises were competing in terms of parameters and computational power, while the second stage focused more on commercial applications. Ultimately, AI applications need to be reflected in products, and the competitiveness of products relies on AI to bridge generational gaps. As of now, AI products have emerged in South Korea. On January 17 this year, Samsung held its annual flagship product launch event in San Jose, California, United States, and unveiled the world’s first AI smartphone, the Galaxy S24 series. Among them, the most astonishing feature of Galaxy AI is its real-time voice translation and text translation capabilities, which can almost render all simultaneous interpreters worldwide unemployed. According to Samsung, this feature currently supports 13 languages, including Chinese, Korean, English, French, German, Japanese, etc., and to some extent, it breaks through human language barriers. Therefore, when Apple saw Samsung’s products and realized that this sets the standard for generational divisions, it sought cooperation to catch up with Samsung. Otherwise, it would fall behind the times completely. In comparison, China is still at the stage where it considers itself to have achieved technological superiority, yet nothing is further from the truth. In 2023, influenced by ChatGPT, large-scale AI models in China showed explosive growth for a while. Since large-scale models are not easy to measure intuitively and there is no objective evaluation method, major model e...",-2

Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now,2024-04-02T22:03:44+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals,"By  Brandon Widder and  Cameron Faulkner If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. In September, Apple launched its latest batch of smartwatches, introducing the Apple Watch Ultra 2 ($799) alongside the new Apple Watch Series 9 ($399). Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE ($249), but the introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had. But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 10, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 4 and newer, though no one can say with certainty whether the Series 4 will get the next big software update or whether it will be exclusive to newer watches. Picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors. Now, let’s get into the deals. The Apple Watch Series 9 features a brand-new S9 processor that enables offline Siri use, brighter displays, and the double tap gesture. It also has the second-gen ultra wideband chip for Precision Finding if you have an iPhone 15. The Apple Watch Series 9 represents a slight upgrade over last year’s Apple Watch Series 8. It uses Apple’s new S9 SiP processor and second-gen ultra wideband chip, though there aren’t many significant differences beyond that. The Apple Watch Series 9 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It introduces a slightly faster S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allow for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with your iPhone. It also offers a brighter, 2,000-nit display and works with Apple’s new “double tap,” a feature that lets you tap your thumb and index finger together to carry out various actions. While the improvements are welcome, the Series 9 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 8. The Apple Watch Series 9 has been out for less than six months, but the GPS-equipped model is already on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy in the 41mm sizing starting at $329 ($70 off) or in the larger 45mm configuration at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for as low as $359 ($70 off). As for the LTE model with cellular connectivity, it’s available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy in the 41mm configuration starting at $429 ($70 off). You can also pick it up in the 45mm sizing at Amazon and Walmart starting at $459 ($70 off). The latest SE borrows a few features from the Series 8, including the same chipset and Crash Detection feature, but it’s an otherwise subtle upgrade from the last-gen SE. Apple’s entry-level wearable represents a minor upgrade when compared to the prior SE, though it does introduce a faster chipset and...",1
Jennifer Lopez & Ben Affleck Board Private Helicopter During NYC Trip,2024-04-02T20:35:34+00:00,https://www.tmz.com/2024/04/02/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-board-private-helicopter-new-york-city-trip/,"Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck were all over the Big Apple last week -- and they even went upstate ... which they were able to get to thanks to a trusty private helicopter! TMZ has obtained video of the couple departing the Copake Country Club in Copake Lake, NY Friday -- a little more than 100 miles outside of the city -- and they did it in style ... rolling up to the chopper in SUVs, and then being carted down to the landing site from there. The whole scene was incredibly surreal ... and honestly, it looked like something straight out of a movie, or even a TV show -- a la ""Succession"" ... or dare we say, ""The Accountant?"" Ben had a briefcase with him as he and Jen looked super buttoned-up, dressed for the cold. Once they got to their helicopter ... they were up in the air and off to the races -- or more accurately, back to Manhattan ... where Jen and Ben were later seen at a Broadway show. Bennifer was spotted all over NYC throughout the weekend and the reason they were even in town was for a new movie Jen's in. Per Page Six, she's in the middle of shooting an adaptation of the musical ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" ... so, a little work and play, it seems. There are also reports they were house hunting out there as well -- which would be interesting, considering Jen's homegrown roots ... and Ben's adjacent East Coast ties. If their little outing this weekend was any indication of how they'd roll if there were permanently in town ... they'd kinda be the King and Queen of NY. That's the vibe anway. Yes!

Apple May Be Ready to Tackle Robots,2024-04-03T23:22:17+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/apple-may-be-ready-to-tackle-robots/,"On the heals of its exit from developing autonomous vehicles, Apple is reportedly looking at the possibility of developing home robots. Apple surprised the industry when reports surfaced in late February that it had killed off Project Titan, its decade-long attempt to crack the autonomous vehicle market, despite sinking billions into the endeavor. It appears the company is looking for a way to capitalize on its investment. According to Bloomberg, Apple is working on two types of personal home robots. One is a mobile robot that can follow users around and presumably perform tasks. Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s source says the company has already created a table-top home device that moves a display around via robotics. Given the amount of AI and machine learning research that went into Project Titan, it’s not surprising that Apple is looking for other markets where that expertise can be applied. In many ways, at least on the surface, robotics is a field that seems far closer and more easily aligned with Apple core business than automobiles.

‘The New Look’ Cast and Character Guide: Who Plays the Fashion Icons? | Photos,2024-04-03T23:18:10+00:00,https://www.thewrap.com/the-new-look-cast-and-character-guide-photos/,"The Apple TV+ drama series brings the brand names behind haute couture fashion houses to life Apple TV+’s “The New Look” brings the people behind iconic haute couture fashion houses to life as it traces the cultural clash between the designers Coco Chanel (Juliette Binoche) and Christian Dior (Ben Mendelsohn) after World War II and the Holocaust. As Chanel gets pushed out of the zeitgeist, Dior’s designs — based on his need to create for survival — slowly take the reins of haute couture. The plot splits between the two fashion legends — though they never speak to each other throughout the show’s 10 episodes — as well as Dior’s sister, Catherine, and her harrowing experiences fighting for the French resistance. Here are the famous faces portraying other famous faces in Apple TV+’s “The New Look” cast: Christian Dior (Ben Mendelsohn) Christian Dior started out working under Lucien Lelong at Lelong’s atelier, or fashion house, but he rose to prominence towards the end of World War II and gained ground swiftly in the aftermath of the war. His fierce love for his sister Catherine drives a lot of his decisions. Ben Mendelsohn is known for playing Andrew “Pope” Cody in “Animal Kingdom” (2010), Daggett in “The Dark Knight Rises” (2012), Orson Krennic in “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” (2016) and Sorrento in “Ready Player One” (2018). He plays Jacob in “The Marsh King’s Daughter” (2023) and he will soon be seen as The Guy in “Freaky Tales” (2024). He also appears as Talos in Marvel properties like “Secret Invasion” and “Captain Marvel” (2019). Coco Chanel (Juliette Binoche) Coco Chanel chose to close the doors of her haute couture brand while the Nazis neutralized the demand for fashion, selling only her No. 5 perfume to stay afloat. She had associations with some Nazis when it came to her French soldier nephew Andre, as well as power moves she hoped to make to remain relevant in culture. Juliette Binoche won an Oscar for her supporting role in “The English Patient” (1997).

Everything you need to know about the App Store and Apple TV outage happening now,2024-04-03T23:07:22+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-app-store-tv-podcasts-down-outage-april-2024-news/,"Happy Wednesday evening, everyone! You’re unwinding for the day, getting ready for a relaxing night, and … you realize that the App Store and a bunch of other Apple services aren’t working. Don’t worry, you aren’t alone. What Apple services are down? When did the problems start? Is the outage still ongoing? Here’s everything you need to know. According to DownDetector, reports of outages with the App Store flooded in a little after 6 p.m. ET. Reports appear to have spiked at over 6,000, indicating pretty widespread problems. Attempting to open the App Store showed a “Cannot Connect” message, followed by “Something went wrong. Please try again.” This came just a few hours after WhatsApp and Facebook were down earlier this afternoon. In addition to the App Store, other Apple services were down, too. Apple Podcasts, Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple Sports, and Apple Fitness+ all experienced similar issues. Thankfully, all appears to be OK now. As of around 7:40 p.m. ET, almost all of Apple’s services are back to normal. The Apple System Status website shows one lingering outage for Apple’s Developer ID Notary Service, but that’s it. Checking on our end, the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and all other Apple services are working as intended. Over the past few months, Apple has released a steady stream of research papers detailing its work with generative AI. So far, Apple has been tight-lipped about what exactly is cooking in its research labs, while rumors circulate that Apple is in talks with Google to license its Gemini AI for iPhones. But there have been a couple of teasers of what we can expect. In February, an Apple research paper detailed an open-source model called MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE) that is capable of media editing using natural language instructions from users. Now, another research paper on Ferret UI has sent the AI community into a frenzy. While my primary device these days continues to be my iPhone 15 Pro, I’ve dabbled with plenty of Android phones since I’ve been here at Digital Trends. One of my favorite brands of phone has been the Google Pixel because of its strong suite of photo-editing tools and good camera hardware. Google first added the Magic Eraser capability with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, which is a tool I love using. Then, with the Pixel 8 series, Google added the Magic Editor, which uses generative AI to make edits that wouldn’t be possible otherwise. There are also tools like Photo Unblur, which is great for old photographs and enhancing images that were captured with low-quality sensors. If you want the best iPhone money can buy in 2024, you have two options: the iPhone 15 Pro and the iPhone 15 Pro Max. They have the same chipset, similar display technology, nearly identical cameras, etc. It's a really close battle, save for the fact that the iPhone 15 Pro is $200 cheaper. It might be tempting to save some cash and choose the iPhone 15 Pro, but I recommend you splurge for the larger (and more expensiv...",-1
"Squatters terrorized NYC block for months before burning house down, fed-up neighbors say",2024-04-04T23:27:52+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/04/04/us-news/squatters-terrorized-nyc-block-for-months-before-burning-house-down-neighbors-say/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 A crew of squatters wreaked havoc on a Brooklyn block for months, stealing from — and threatening — neighbors before burning a house to the ground last November, fed-up locals and politicians said Thursday. The reign of terror in Dyker Heights landed one troublesome intruder behind bars on an arson rap — but that was little compensation for area residents left reeling over yet another Big Apple squatter nightmare.  “It was a very quiet neighborhood before and then suddenly when it happened, those people break into the house,” said Ming Zhu, who lives two houses from the home at 1237 67th Street. “They went to our neighbor’s backyard and grabbed a brick and they say, ‘We are going to break your window’ and we can’t do nothing,'” said Zhu, 42. “It’s not fair. We pay for property taxes, we pay for expensive house costs. We are working hard for the American Dream but that’s what we get for it?” The squatters broke into the empty home over the summer, and quickly became a nuisance — ripping off security cameras and other goods from other houses and menacing residents.  Cheng Chen, 46, was charged with arson and criminal mischief for the Nov. 29 blaze, and was later hit with a six-month prison sentence after pleading guilty, prosecutors said.  “The fire was caused by candles,” Chen told cops, according to a criminal complaint. “I was smoking cigarettes, lit a candle. While I had the stove on to heat up the water and to keep myself warm, [I] went downstairs to take a shower. When I came back I saw flames and smoke everywhere.” The blaze caused $900,000 worth of damage to the home. “In our neighborhood, we don’t have the Hamptons houses,” city Councilwoman Susan Zhuang told reporters at a Gravesend press conference on Thursday.  “We the people have the small houses. We work hard, check by check,” she said. “They are hardworking families that pay their mortgages from paycheck to paycheck. Meanwhile, squatters enter their home while they are on vacation. People’s lives are turned upside down.” The Dyker Heights dilemma is just the latest in the recent rash of high-profile squatter horrors.  Under New York City law, anyone who beds down in a home or apartment for at least 30 days can claim squatter’s rights, even if they broke into the property without permission from the rightful owner.  Last week, a pair of squatters at a Jamaica duplex sued the legal owners of a $930,000 home, claiming they were locked out despite establishing tenancy — and included a Shake Shack receipt as “proof.” In Flushing, squatter Brian Rodriguez demanded an $18,000 ransom to move out of the four-bedroom $1 million house he claimed rights to — with cops even handcuffing the rightful owner when she showed up. One Big Apple case turned deadly when a pair of teen squatters allegedly killed property owner Nadia Vitels after she showed up at the East 31st apartment owned by her late mom on March 12. And last week, federal ag...",0
Gun-toting Bronx migrant squatters were in custody but set free because processing centers were crowded: officials,2024-04-04T22:47:28+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/04/04/us-news/gun-toting-bronx-migrant-squatters-were-in-custody-but-set-free-because-processing-centers-were-crowded-officials/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 A migrant squatter crew that terrorized a Bronx neighborhood were in federal custody but cut loose because of overcrowded processing centers – allowing them to run amok in the Big Apple. The Venezuelan migrants evaded justice over and over even after one was set for deportation, another was charged with attempted murder — and eight suspects were nabbed in the Bronx with drugs and guns in their possession, leaving neighbors shaken and the landlord fearing for his life. Officials have since rounded up all but one of the crew, who remained on the loose Thursday. “One of the eight Venezuelan citizens remains at large,” ICE Spokesperson Marie Ferguson said Wednesday night, although she did not name the suspect.  Ferguson said the US Border Patrol in Texas detained four of the group — Yoessy Pino Castillo, Yojairo Martinez, Javier Alborno and Yerbin Lozado-Munoz — between September 2022 and May 2023. But they were released because of overcrowding chaos at the Laredo Sector Enhanced Centralized Processing Center in Laredo, Texas, and the Central Processing Center in El Paso, she said. Meanwhile, Johan Cardenas Silva was ordered to be deported — but was released seven months later from the Stewart County Detention Center on an order of supervision and told to report to New York. All five ditched their processing appointments, and elected instead to gather in a house on Hull Avenue in the Bronx, where neighbors claim they ran a drug-dealing operation. While they were free on the streets, several of the migrants racked up a laundry list of crimes ranging from criminal possession of loaded firearms to burglary — and even assault and the attempted murder charge. Hector Desousa-Villalta, who illegally entered the country through Texas on May 3, was arrested on Aug. 28 for first degree assault with a weapon and attempted murder, but the charges were dropped after his accuser refused to corroborate, according to NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell. Despite those charges, Desousa-Villalta was cut loose in Bronx Criminal Court despite the district attorney’s request that he be held on nearly half a million dollars bond. Identified by neighbors and the apartment landlord as the “leader” of the gun-toting migrant squatter drug ring, Desousa-Villalta sparked the NYPD bust on March 27 after he pulled a a 9 mm CZ pistol and pointed it at someone in an alley near the house, police said. “A guy in a car with Florida plates pulled up and he was threatening these guys. And they all came out with their guns and somebody called the cops,” said neighbor John Colby, 67. When cops went in the house, they allegedly found four guns and several bags of drugs that led them to charge each of the migrant occupants. “Ask any of the neighbors here, all night they’re going back and forth with this delivery service, delivering the drugs and the guns and it’s all out in the open and it’s all non-stop crazy,” Colby said.

Apple Reportedly Developing Robots That'll Roam Your Home - CNET,2024-04-04T22:21:54+00:00,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-reportedly-developing-robots-thatll-roam-your-home/#ftag=CAD590a51e,"
    After shelving its self-driving car project, the iPhone maker is eyeing bots as its ""next big thing,"" according to Bloomberg.
   Apple is reportedly developing personalized home bots. Apple is reportedly moving on from cars to... robots? After nixing its electric vehicle project in February, the iPhone maker is now eyeing personal robots that could follow you around your home, according to a report from Bloomberg. The project is reportedly in its early stages, and it isn't clear if the products will ever become a reality. But now that Apple has called off its decade-long effort to build an electric car, home robots could be the company's ""next big thing,"" people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.  See also: The iPhone May Get a Big Dose of AI This Year. Here's What to Expect Apple didn't respond to CNET's request for comment. In recent years, the tech giant has been exploring new ways to bring in revenue, especially as people hold onto their phones longer. It's branched out into subscription-based services like Apple TV Plus and Apple Music and released entirely new products like the Apple Vision Pro -- which, with a $3,500 price tag and not much to offer out of the gate, will likely take years to achieve widescale adoption. But home robotics could offer the company a new way to leverage artificial intelligence and have a foothold in people's homes, Bloomberg notes. Along with a mobile robot, Apple has reportedly developed ""an advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around,"" the publication notes. That smart display is further along than the mobile robot and ""has been added and removed from the company's product road map over the years,"" according to the report, as executives have disagreed on whether to even pursue that product.  While Apple has been taking things slow when it comes deploying AI in its products and services, it could leverage any advancements in that area to boost its rumored robotics offerings. If the company did ultimately launch a home bot, it would join the ranks of Amazon's $1,600 Astro robot, which can deliver snacks, patrol your home and follow you around while you're on a video call.  Apple has similarly envisioned having its robot work as a videoconferencing tool that can navigate on its own, according to Bloomberg, and has even pitched the idea of having it do chores like washing dishes. Whether or not these more ambitious functions -- or even the robots themselves -- see the light of day is unclear. But if they do, it'll likely be several years before you have an Apple robot roaming your home.",2
"iOS 16.7.8, iOS 16.7.9 & More: What’s Next for iOS 16",2024-04-04T22:15:42+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/ios-16-7-8-ios-16-7-9-ios-16-8-iphone/,"Published on By If you own an iPhone X, iPhone 8, or iPhone 8 Plus, you might be wondering what’s next in terms of iOS 16 software updates. Well, we’ve got you covered as today we’ll take a look at what owners of these devices can expect in 2024 and beyond.  While much of Apple’s focus has been on iOS 17 (and iOS 18), the company continues to push new software to iPhone users stuck on iOS 16. The iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus didn’t make the move to iOS 17 and they won’t make the move to iOS 18 later this year. However, they will continue to get updates for the foreseeable future. Apple recently pushed iOS 16.7.7 with security patches to these devices and there will be more down the road. In fact, we expect Apple to continue to support these devices with new software into 2025. Table of Contents Here’s a look at what iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus users can expect the rest of the way. Apple hasn’t confirmed an iOS 16.7.8 update, but it should be next in line for the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone 8 Plus.  We don’t know when the company will release the software, but the most likely scenario right now is sometime in May alongside iOS 17.5. If Apple releases iOS 17.4.2 in April, iOS 16.7.8 may roll out alongside that version of iOS 17, but there’s no guarantee we see a point release ahead of iOS 17.5. Assuming Apple sticks to protocol, we should see the company release iOS 16.7.9 alongside iOS 17.6. We expect iOS 17.6 to arrive in July. After that, we suspect we’ll probably see iOS 16.8 (a milestone upgrade in name only) roll out to iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus users. Keep in mind, most, if not all of these versions of iOS 16, will be limited to security patches and the occasional bug fix. That goes for iOS 16.8 as well. We could potentially see Apple push Rapid Security Response updates to iOS 16 users as well, but given how infrequent they’ve been, there’s no guarantee this happens. Unless Apple changes how it handles software updates for older devices, iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus users should expect support to carry over into late 2024 and 2025.  Of course, if Apple’s approach to iOS 15 is any indication, the releases will become more sporadic than they were in 2024. Since September of last year, Apple’s only released three versions of iOS 15: iOS 15.8 in October, iOS 15.8.1 in January, and iOS 15.8.2 in March. iOS 16’s path may not mirror this exactly, but owners of these aging iPhone models should expect to see development slow down once Apple releases iOS 18 in September. In the fall of 2025, Apple may drop support for the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X forcing owners of these devices to upgrade in order to get the latest security patches.

Is Apple Podcasts’ Subscription Program A Paywall for Creators?,2024-04-04T21:40:01+00:00,https://radioink.com/2024/04/04/is-apple-podcasts-subscription-program-a-paywall-for-creators/,"Amid Department of Justice scrutiny over alleged power abuse in other areas, Apple could find itself in pay-for-play-type turmoil as the company tries to promote its podcast monetization program, which offers premium show subscriptions in exchange for a cut of the profits. As it stands, Apple Podcasts offers a coveted promotional spot at the top of its feed. To secure this prime placement, creators traditionally submit their shows through a formal application process. However, a more direct route to gaining this exposure involves joining Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, which allows for the sale of premium content through the app. Recent observations reveal that a significant portion of podcasts featured in the Apple Podcasts app’s “browse” carousel are part of this subscription service. According to Semafor, podcast industry insiders have shared that Apple has been encouraging creators to enroll in the subscription program as a strategy for securing promotional space. While not all top-slotted shows are subscription participants, Apple has allegedly been actively funneling creators into this service, offering them enhanced app features and reserved spots in the carousel. Apple’s dominant interface and the challenge of standing out among numerous podcasts make the app’s top banner a key promotional tool. However, Apple’s subscription model, which takes a 30% cut of subscriber revenue in the first year and 15% thereafter, presents a steep margin compared to competitors like Substack and Patreon. The company’s new approach to subscriptions suggests a push towards a model that benefits both Apple and content creators, despite the absence of third-party ads and a history of non-monetization in its podcast service.

Here’s Apple’s 916-page appeal over the Apple Watch ban,2024-04-05T23:05:59+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122407/apple-watch-masimo-itc-appeal-smartwatch-wearables,"By  Victoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 11 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. There was no question that Apple would appeal when the International Trade Commission banned Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 sales last year. Well, if you’ve got some time, you can now read all 916 pages of Apple’s appeal to the Federal Circuit.  A quick recap: the Apple Watch ban centers around whether Apple infringed upon medical device-maker Masimo’s pulse oximetry patents. The ITC sided with Masimo, concluding that Apple had infringed their patents, and that the infringement was harming domestic industry.  The ITC is an agency similar to a court that often deals with imported “articles” that may or may not violate intellectual property law. The word “article” matters more than you’d think, since the statute that created the ITC specifies that it has jurisdiction over “articles.” Not to get too into the weeds, but a good chunk of Apple’s appeal argues: what domestic industry? And what articles? The appeal brief claims that not only was Masimo primarily known for clinical pulse oximeters, it didn’t even have an actual smartwatch when the complaint was filed. The smartwatch in question is Masimo’s W1 smartwatch, which launched in 2022. Masimo filed with the ITC in 2021, and according to Apple’s brief, Masimo only provided CAD drawings as evidence. In the 2015 case ClearCorrect Operating, LLC v. International Trade Commission, the Federal Circuit ruled that 3D models sent over the internet don’t count as “articles,” and aren’t subject to ITC jurisdiction. Basically, Apple’s trying to argue that there was no real case at the time the ITC complaint was filed — no watches, no “articles,” no domestic industry — and therefore the ban should be thrown out.  The 916 pages filed today include a 68 page brief, the 300+ page ITC decision being appealed, hundreds of eye-watering pages from the Patent Office, and more.  The big takeaway though is that Apple seems concerned that if this decision should hold, Masimo’s route may become an attractive strategy for others. “If the Commission’s decision is affirmed, the door of the agency’s ‘trade forum’ will be opened to complainants who lack an actual domestic industry but possess pleading creativity and CAD software. That is not what Congress intended and not what the statutory text permits,” reads the brief. It has reason to be concerned. At least one other medical tech company, AliveCor, has turned to the ITC to ban Apple Watches. The ITC also ruled that Apple infringed on AliveCor’s EKG tech and issued an import ban. Biden also refused to veto that ban, but AliveCor is currently appealing a Patent Trial and Appeals Board ruling that says its tech isn’t actually patentable.  For now, Apple has gotten around the import ban by selling modified versions of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 that disables the blood oxygen tech. It’s li...",-2
5 Reasons to Wait for Apple Watch 10 & 5 Reasons Not To,2024-04-05T22:04:02+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/5-reasons-to-wait-for-apple-watch-10-4-reasons-not-to/,"Published on By Apple’s reportedly working on a new Apple Watch for 2024. The Apple Watch 10 release date is still a long way out, but you still might want to hold of on an upgrade and wait for the new model. Last year, Apple released the new Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Both are solid additions to the company’s Watch lineup, but bigger changes could be in store this year. Reports have outlined two new models: A new Apple Watch SE 3 and a higher-end model dubbed Apple Watch 10 or, perhaps, Apple Watch X. The name Apple Watch X would be used to mark the Watch’s 10th anniversary. If you recall, Apple did something similar for the iPhone for its 10th anniversary. That’s where the iPhone X’s name comes from.  We’re just months removed from the Apple Watch 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 launch, but we’ve already seen quite a bit of back and forth regarding the 2024 models. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, a primary source of these rumors, claims Apple’s working on a major overhaul and that it could come in the form of a new Apple Watch X. Apple’s original Apple Watch was announced back in 2014 and launched in 2015 so Gurman isn’t sure if the device will launch in 2024 or in 2025. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is another source talking about this year’s Apple Watch lineup and he claims the devices are “unlikely” to offer “significant innovative experiences.” It’s a bit confusing right now, as it typically is months before Apple releases a new product, and that might have some of you on edge. Apple Watch 10 rumors put those of you searching for a new smartwatch in a tough position: Buy now or wait and see what Apple’s got up its sleeve in 2024. If that question is rattling around in your brain, allow us to help. Table of Contents In this guide we’ll take you through the best reasons to consider waiting for the Apple Watch 10 and the best reasons to go with another device long before it arrives. Gurman believes Apple is targeting 2024 for a blood pressure monitor on the Apple Watch. This is the earliest it will launch and there could be a delay. That being said, it’s a feature worth waiting for. He’s outlined three health features Apple’s working on: glucose and blood sugar monitoring, the ability to take blood pressure, and the ability to measure body temperature. Of these, it looks like the blood pressure tool is the closest to launch. If this pans out, the Apple Watch 10 would be able to detect a user’s blood pressure from the wrist using infrared light. If you have blood pressure issues, or simply want a quick way to check, this feature alone might be worth the wait. In addition to blood pressure monitoring, the next Apple Watch is expected to gain sleep apnea detection.  Mark Gurman’s outlined the change in a lengthy piece about Apple’s focus on health and he says “it will use sleep and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone has the condition. Gurman also says the Watch will then direct users to see a physician if necessary. This is the first tim...",2

This allows the Apple Watch to fetch information like your approximate location for use in apps like Google Maps and Apple Fitness. The weather app also periodically checks for your location for accurate forecast details.





To ensure that the weather app is able to use your Apple Watch's GPS, you need to enable location services from its settings. You can do so by following these steps:

On your Apple Watch, open the Settings app.
Navigate to Privacy & Security > Location Services.
Tap to turn the Location Services toggle on.
Next, on your iPhone, launch the Settings app and head to Privacy & Security > Location Services.
Scroll down to find the Weather app and select ""Always"". 

Turning location services on helps your iPhone and Apple Watch access weather information in the background.

Fat chance! Out-of-shape NYC loses big to fit West Coast rivals in new healthy cities ranking,2024-04-06T20:36:54+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/04/06/lifestyle/fat-chance-out-of-shape-nyc-loses-big-to-fit-west-coast-rivals-in-new-healthy-cities-ranking/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Talk about the Big Apple. A whopping 60% of New Yorkers are either overweight or obese — a sad statistic that weighed Gotham down considerably in a new ranking of America’s healthiest cities. The city that never sleeps huffed and puffed its way onto the list at No. 18 overall, out of 182 US burgs.  The overall positioning was determined by the quality of healthcare, food, green space and — crucially — the fitness of the population. That leaves NYC lagging behind the likes of Portland, Oregon; Denver, Colorado; and image-conscious Los Angeles. New York’s fitness score — No. 117 out of 182 — may have been a major downer, but we might have a pretty good excuse: As home to some of the world’s best restaurants, the city ranked No. 2 in the food category, meaning we are second to only one city when it comes to access to quality and healthy eats.  “Staying healthy is a personal responsibility, and everyone should strive to eat nutritious food, exercise regularly and look after their mental health,” Cassandra Happe, an analyst for WalletHub, which conducted the survey, said in a written statement.  “However, where people live can have a big influence on how successful they are at staying in good health, so the best cities are the ones that provide the greatest access to high-quality healthcare, green spaces, recreation centers, and healthy food.” WalletHub analysts used evaluating metrics like mental and physical health, cost of healthcare and medication, doctors and gourmet grocers per capita, gyms and membership costs and the availability of green space to determine America’s healthiest — and unhealthiest — cities. For the best — and the worst — of the list, read on.  You can’t keep a good city down.  San Francisco — a town famously troubled with crime and inequality, post-COVID — was crowned the “healthiest,” primarily due to the low number of obese adults in the area, measuring in at about 19% of the city’s population.  According to the report, the City by The Bay is also home to “the second-lowest share of people who eat less than one serving of fruits or vegetables per day.”  Better yet, the entire population is near a location where they can exercise — not to mention the sheer number of health-conscious restaurants per capita, many of which have plant-based and gluten-free options. “The Golden Gate City spends more per capita on parks and recreation than other major cities, allowing people to enjoy well-maintained nature and physical activity, and it’s also one of the most walkable and most bikeable cities,” the report reads. Coming it at second place was equally pricey Honolulu, Hawaii. Analysts listed good mental health, insurance coverage, outdoor spaces and the high number of farmers markets as reasons for its impressive ranking. In third is Seattle, Washington — the Pacific Northwest city infamous for its gloomy weather had one of the highest physical activity rates, according to t...",0
Do AirTags work with Android phones?,2024-04-06T20:00:42+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/do-airtags-work-with-android-phones/,"Apple’s AirTag is a valuable tool for tracking items such as wallets, keys, backpacks, luggage, etc. However, before you can use it, it must be paired with a smartphone. This raises an important question: Can you use an AirTag with an Android phone? Do you have to set it up with an iPhone? Here’s what you need to know. The short answer is a resounding “no” — you cannot use AirTags with any Android phone. It’s important to note that AirTags are only compatible with iPhones, such as the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro. Any Android phone, regardless of what model it is, won’t work with an Apple AirTag. That said, you can still locate an AirTag if you have an Android phone. Although AirTags do not offer full functionality with Android, Apple provides the Tracker Detect app on the Google Play Store. The free app is designed to scan for nearby AirTags and other Find My compatible devices that might track you without your consent. AirTags can be used to track people’s location or other items with their consent, and this gives folks with Android phones an easy way to thwart those attempts. If you own an Android phone, you can still use other item trackers that do the same thing as AirTags. These trackers come in various forms and offer different app-based options. The Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2, for instance, is the best AirTag alternative for Samsung users. It can last up to 500 days before requiring a battery replacement and can locate items up to 400 feet away. Other AirTag alternatives include ones from Tile, Chipolo, Pebblebee, Cube, and many others. We receive a lot of important information via text. Whether it’s a date you need to set or important work-related info, you might find yourself wanting to save a text message. Modern smartphones all offer a way to back up your core data and transfer it to another device. However, transfers sometimes don’t include your text messages unless you save them ahead of time or are transferring across the same mobile operating system. Here's how to save your text messages in Android and iOS.
How to save your text messages on iPhone
There are multiple ways to backup your iPhone text messages. Here are the easiest.
How to make iPhone text message backups using iExplorer
The most universal method of saving your iPhone text messages is via the iExplorer program. Since its landmark introduction in 2007, Apple has released 42 iPhone models, and with at least four new ones introduced every fall, the company is showing no signs of slowing down. In all that time, Apple has made relatively few significant design changes. The company tends to stick with established designs for three or four years before changing things up, which can sometimes make it difficult to tell which iPhone model you have —  especially if you're getting a secondhand iPhone (with no box to offer a hint) rather than a new one. “Do I need all that?” That’s the question on the mind of shoppers before they splurge a now-standard $1,000 asking price for a top-...",-1
Manhattan’s sinking: 9 Big Apple nabes drop off country’s Top 100 ritziest ZIP codes list,2024-04-06T18:59:11+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/04/06/us-news/9-nyc-nabes-drop-off-countrys-top-100-ritziest-zip-codes-list/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Code red! Some of the Big Apple’s ritziest ZIP codes are seeing home values plummet amid the sustained exodus from the city caused by the pandemic, spiraling crime and ballooning taxes, experts told The Post. This year, there are only three New York City locales on Zillow’s list of the 100 most expensive ZIP codes in the country – down 75% from the 12 Manhattan neighborhoods on the pre-pandemic 2019 list. And the three Manhattan postal codes that remain on the 2024 list have seen their prestige wane: Ken Girardin, the research director for the Albany-based think tank, Empire Center for Public Policy, blamed the pandemic-induced exodus and sky-high taxes for plummeting home values in the Big Apple.  “In terms of high value residential real estate, one of the biggest factors to consider is that living in New York City now means paying potentially the highest combined state and local income tax rate in the country … and that is something that people are considering when they’re deciding where they want to live,” Girardin told The Post.  “If you are fabulously wealthy and your primary residence is in Florida, you can spend time in New York City without the city or state getting to tax your capital gains. But if you’re looking for one residence and looking to be there year-round, you’re facing a massive tax bite by moving to Manhattan,” Girardin said. Surging crime and homelessness is also a significant factor in the declining desire to live in neighborhoods such as Soho, Tribeca and Greenwich Village, according to Eric Benaim, the president of the NYC-based real estate group Modern Spaces.  “There has also been a shortage of housing [in New York City] and interest rates are really high, so that causes less people to move around, and less people moving around means fewer transactions,” Benaim explained.  “For now, I would look at this as an opportunity to buy – as what goes down must come up,” the ever-optimistic real estate agent added.  Indeed, luxury Big Apple realtors are holding onto hope that a six-bedroom, 6,900-square-foot condo like No. 6 at 62 Wooster Street in Soho’s 10013 ZIP code – which is currently on the market for a whopping $35,000,000 – will defy the damning Zillow data.  Besides the three Manhattan ZIP codes, eight Long Island locales made the Top 100. In Sagaponack’s 11962 ZIP code – ranked the fourth most expensive in the country for the last two years — a three-bedroom home on a two-and-a-quarter acre property at 40 Narrow Lane East is on the market for $6,995,000.  Suffolk County’s Water Mill is the 10th most expensive ZIP code in the country this year, while Bridgehampton came in at  21st, Amagansett at 35th, Quogue at 54th, Wainscott at 60th, Mill Neck at 68th, and Old Westbury at 75th.  ZIP code 94027 in Atherton, CA – home to the likes of  Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Fleetwood Mac’s Lindsey Buckingham – has been the most expensive ZIP code every year sinc...",0

How to keep your MacBook from sleeping,2024-04-07T19:45:58+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-keep-macbook-from-sleeping/,"Your MacBook is your go-to powerhouse for all things computing. Web browsing, graphic design, video editing, music production, you name it, the MacBook can do it. But like any good laptop, your MacBook has a number of battery-saving features built in and enabled by default. One of these functions is the computer’s sleep mode, which optimizes battery life by decreasing power usage. MacBook Air or MacBook Pro If you walk out of your office with a window open on your MacBook, and when you walk back in the screen is black, your computer is in sleep mode. But if you’re using your MacBook for networking features that require constant full power, or you just want to turn off sleep mode because you don’t like it, there’s a simple way to disable it. Some things changed with the introduction of macOS Ventura. The name of the utility used to configure your Mac has changed from ""System preferences"" to ""System Settings."" And the format changed from an icon-oriented interface to tabs along the side. Many of the specific system settings also changed. So, if you're moving from a Mac with a previous version of macOS, you'll want to follow these instructions. Nevertheless, it remains simple enough to turn off sleep mode in macOS Ventura and later. Step 1: Open System Settings. Step 2: Select the Lock Screen tab. You'll find two options: Turn display off on battery when inactive and Turn display off on power adapter when inactive. Next to each will be a selection for how long the display should be inactive before turning it off. Select ""Never"" to prevent your Mac from sleeping, Step 3: You can also make sure your Mac doesn't go to sleep when plugged in and the display is off. To do so, select the Battery tab, then Options.... Then toggle Prevent sleeping on power adapter when the display is off to on. Step 1: Select System preferences. Step 2: Choose the Energy saver icon (or Battery for newer versions of macOS). Step 3: There are two tabs – Battery and Power Adapter. The former will be selected automatically when opening Energy Saver, so let’s start with that. By default, the Turn Display Off After section will already be set to a specific time, which is used when there’s no activity being detected on the Mac. In order to disable this feature completely, drag the slider to the right where it says Never. Step 4: A warning window will appear stating that the MacBook may consume more energy with these specific settings. Hit the OK button to confirm the change. Step 5: Below the slider, there’s a few additional settings that you can disable as well: Step 6: Select the Power adapter tab and drag the slider to the right once again to Never, and also turn off some of the settings below (keep the first one turned on): If your Schedule tool is enabled within Energy Saver, then you’ll need to turn that off as well to keep your MacBook from sleeping. Step 1: Select the Schedule button. Step 2: Untick the boxes Start up or wake and Sleep boxes. Select the OK button. In the ev...",0
"TechCrunch Mobility: Apple layoffs, an EV price reckoning and another Tesla robotaxi promise",2024-04-07T19:00:30+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/07/techcrunch-mobility-an-ev-price-reckoning-av-startup-ghost-autonomy-ghosts-and/,"Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility — your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. Sign up here — just click TechCrunch Mobility — to receive the newsletter every weekend in your inbox. Subscribe for free. Automakers reported auto sales for Q1 and, welp, turns out that pricing sure does matter if you want to sell EVs. Who would have thought? A recent survey by Edmunds comes to a similar conclusion (at least for American buyers), finding a big gap between what consumers want and what is actually available on the market. Here’s the crux. According to the Edmunds survey, 47% say they are seeking an EV purchase below $40,000, and 22% are interested in EVs priced below the $30,000 threshold. Today, there are no new EVs priced below $30,000 and only four below the $40,000 mark. The average price of an EV in 2023 was $61,702, while all other vehicles stood at $47,450. This mismatch of realities is squeezing automakers as they try to move inventory by slashing prices. This downward pressure has forced automakers like Ford to delay future EV launches and put more resources toward hybrids. Even Tesla, a bellwether in the EV world, fell well below analysts’ expectations with deliveries down 20% from Q4 2023. Meanwhile, EV upstart Rivian posted tepid results. What’s the answer? Well, over at Tesla, it seems the solution is twofold: slash prices again and try to capture revenue through sales of its Full Self-Driving software that costs $12,000 and is currently being offered in a free one-month trial to all customers. OK, folks, let’s jump into the rest of the news!  Founders, investors, engineers, policy wonks and others tell us things. And we’re here to pass along the verifiable information that those little birds have shared with us. This week, a little bird tipped us on the closure of Ghost Autonomy, which had raised upward of $220 million and recently partnered with OpenAI. A couple of calls, emails and a fresh posting on the company’s website confirmed the tip. About 100 people were affected. As I noted in my article, Ghost has pivoted a few times since it was founded in 2017. When I asked founder and CEO John Hayes what happened, he said the company had completed a highway driving product and was moving in urban environments through what he described as “last-mile delivery.” “Ultimately, the years required to bring the product to market could not be financed,” he wrote to me in an email.

Apple’s second-generation AirPods Pro are back on sale for $190,2024-04-07T14:26:26+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/apples-second-generation-airpods-pro-are-back-on-sale-for-190-142626914.html?src=rss,"Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products. Apple’s second-generation AirPods Pro have dipped to under $200 in a deal from Amazon. The AirPods Pro, which normally cost $250, are $60 off right now, bringing the price down to just $190. That’s the same price we saw during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. The AirPods Pro offer a number of premium features over the standard AirPods, including active noise cancellation for when you want to shut out the world, and an impressive transparency mode for when you want to hear your surroundings. Get Apple's second-generation AirPods Pro for $60 off. The second-generation AirPods Pro came out in 2022 and brought Apple’s H2 chip to the earbuds for a notable performance boost. It offers Adaptive Audio, which will automatically switch between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode based on what’s going on around you. With Conversation Awareness, they can lower the volume when you’re speaking and make it so other people's voices are easier to hear. We gave this version of the AirPods Pro a review score of 88, and it’s one of our picks for the best wireless earbuds on the market. The second-generation AirPods Pro are dust, sweat and water resistant, so they should hold up well for workouts, and they achieve better battery life than the previous generation. They can get about six hours of battery life with features like ANC enabled, and that goes up to as much as 30 hours with the charging case. Apple says popping the AirPods Pro in the case for 5 minutes will give you an hour of additional listening or talking time. AirPods Pro also offer Personalized Spatial Audio with head tracking for more immersive listening while you’re watching TV or movies. The gesture controls that were introduced with this generation of the earbuds might take some getting used to, though. With AirPods Pro, you can adjust the volume by swiping the touch control.

Tesla is settling with the family of the Apple engineer who died in an Autopilot crash,2024-04-08T23:25:34+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24124744/tesla-autopilot-lawsuit-settlement-huang-death,"By  Sean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. This week, Tesla was scheduled to appear in court to defend its Autopilot system against a claim of wrongful death — but it looks like the company will pay the family of Apple engineer Wei “Walter” Huang instead.  Court documents show that Tesla is trying to seal the amount of a potential settlement payment to the Huang family. While it’s not clear how much the company might be offering or what other terms the settlement includes, lawyers for Tesla state that both parties have already agreed to the settlement and want it to be confidential.  You can read that document below; The Washington Post and Bloomberg reported the news earlier. Lawyers for the Huang family didn’t immediately respond to our email. The settlement has not yet been approved by a judge. Court documents suggest that there’ll be a follow-up hearing this Thursday, April 11th to discuss the settlement further — after the California Department of Transportation, which is also a defendant in the case, gets a chance to object to the settlement.  Huang’s Tesla Model X was confirmed to be using Autopilot when it smashed into a safety barrier in Mountain View, California in March 2018. He died following the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that both Autopilot and distracted driving were factors leading to the crash.  Tesla was planning to argue that Huang was playing a game on his phone at the time — he had a pattern of playing games during commute hours, and investigators found a game was the frontmost app on his phone at the time, but couldn’t determine if he was actually playing it when the vehicle crashed. Tesla wanted to drag Apple into the trial, subpoenaing the company for proof that Apple knew he was playing the game, and Apple has been trying to quash that subpoena.

Samsung’s newest Android tablet is a perfect iPad alternative,2024-04-08T23:13:59+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-tab-s6-lite-2024-now-available-ipad-alternative-news/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? Samsung has just launched a refreshed Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) for the U.S. exclusively through Amazon. This comes after Samsung recently launched the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) internationally. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) is the latest entry in Samsung’s midrange tablet lineup that made its debut in 2020. This newest iteration has the same overall design, S Pen integration, screen, and just 4GB RAM. However, it now has a new Exynos processor and comes with Android 14 right out of the box. It has a 10.4-inch TFT display with 2000 x 1200 pixel resolution, an 8MP rear camera, and a 5MP selfie camera hidden in the thick bezels. Though you can only get up to 128GB of internal storage, you can expand the storage with microSD card support. It also has a massive 7,040mAh battery (though charging is only at 15W speeds), optional LTE connectivity, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Those who are in select regions, such as the U.K., can already purchase the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024). But you won’t find it on Samsung’s website, ironically. The reason? For the U.S., the Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is exclusively sold through Amazon. It only costs $330 for the base 4GB/64GB version, but the price jumps up to $399 if you want 128GB (the RAM, unfortunately, stays at 4GB). It comes in three colors: Oxford Gray, Chiffon Pink, and Mint. Amazon Prime members can get it shipped immediately. At this price point, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite (2024) is a perfect alternative if you don’t want the 9th-generation iPad. It’s priced exactly the same as Apple’s cheapest iPad model, giving folks who prefer Android a new similarly priced option to consider. Did Samsung do this on purpose? It’s hard to say, but it feels like too much of a coincidence if you ask us. If all of this sounds particularly good to you, you can grab one right now on Amazon for just $330. To sweeten the deal, there’s a limited-time bundle that includes a $100 Amazon gift card for the same price. I don’t want to believe one specific rumor about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and would be shocked if Samsung made such an odd strategic decision. But it's possible the 10x optical zoom feature may be removed from the phone. It could go either way at the moment, but if it does happen, it would leave the S24 Ultra with a 3x and a 5x optical zoom and entirely remove the Ultra series's main, unique, standout camera feature. And I hate the thought of that.
Moving backward The Samsung Galaxy S24 series is one of the most anticipated smartphone launches of the coming year.

Tesla settles case over fatal 2018 crash of Apple engineer involving Autopilot,2024-04-08T22:39:45+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/tesla-settles-case-over-fatal-2018-crash-of-apple-engineer-involving-autopilot/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Tesla has settled a lawsuit over a car crash which killed an Apple engineer in 2018 after his car veered off a highway near San Francisco, court documents showed on Monday. The settlement would help Tesla avoid a lengthy jury trial over what role its Autopilot driver-assistance technology may have played in the crash. The case involves a highway accident that killed Walter Huang. Tesla had contended Huang misused the system because he was playing a video game just before the accident. Huang’s family had alleged Autopilot steered his 2017 Model X into a highway barrier. Lawyers for Huang’s family had also raised questions about whether Tesla understood drivers likely would not or could not use the system as directed, and what steps the automaker took to protect them. The crash that killed Huang was among hundreds of US accidents in which Autopilot was a suspected factor in reports to auto safety regulators. The Autopilot system can steer, accelerate and brake by itself on the open road but cannot fully replace a human driver, especially in city driving. Tesla materials explaining the system warn that it does not make the car autonomous and requires a “fully attentive driver” who can “take over at any moment.”",0
"Apparently Samsung Has A Reputation Problem, Galaxy Branding In Doubt",2024-04-09T23:43:18+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/apparently-samsung-has-a-reputation-problem-galaxy-branding-in-doubt/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=apparently-samsung-has-a-reputation-problem-galaxy-branding-in-doubt,"Apparently, Samsung has a reputation problem that has only just been revealed. According to management their premium Galaxy smartphones are appealing to ‘Middle-aged older males, uncles, older sister’s and husbands” and not the younger audience that are in love with all things Apple. In South Korean this consumer is described as the “ajeossi” audience by teens and users in their 20s to mid-30’s who Samsung is desperate to attract to their brand. As a result, Samsung is investing in short films and video’s starring celebrities to change the perception with the younger audience the smartphone maker is trying to attract away from buying Apple phones. There are even discussions internally as to whether Samsung should drop the Galaxy name from future devices due to the perceptions associated with the brand. According to researchers ‘ajeossi’ implies an “older” or “out of style.” audience. Samsung Australia who collects a vast amount of data on their premium Galaxy users has not said who is the actual audience buying their devices. According to the Korean Herald, the world’s largest smartphone maker by shipment said its short film series, “S24 Hours Movie Series,” starring actor Go Min-si and the League of Legends esports champion Faker, reached 10 million views on YouTube on Sunday. This was a month after being released in South Korea. Including the number of views from other social media platforms like Instagram and streaming services, the total surpasses 50 million views, the company said. According to Samsung sources the business is currently losing ground to its archrival Apple with the business keen to turn this problem around in several markets including in the USA where Apple dominate. In South Korean the brand accounts for 7 out of 10 adult smartphone users, according to a recent Gallup survey. Similar to the Australian market Apple’s iPhone is more with users aged between 18 to 29.
Their lifestyles are driven by heavy consumption of TV and digital media, and they are especially engaged in local TV series, as well as celebrities and their aspirational lifestyles. Now Samsung is moving to try and attract a younger user through the short film series by advertising the latest artificial intelligence features in its Galaxy S24 series in a “more fun and friendlier” form. “The short film advertisement is an effective marketing strategy to target the young,” an industry official said. The key AI features of the Galaxy S24 series, including Live Translate, Nightography and Circle to Search, these features are playing crucial roles in the drama’s unfolding in the Samsung short films. Last year, Samsung also presented a short film to promote its Galaxy S23 series. The short film, titled “Faith,” was shot using the smartphone and directed by Na Hong-jin, an award-winning director and screenwriter, widely known for his movie “The Wailing” (2016). The South Korean Herald claims that Apple also employs the short film marketing strategy to increase its popul...",-1
Apple’s latest entry-level iPad has returned to its best price to date,2024-04-09T23:00:18+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24124299/apple-ipad-max-annual-subscription-google-pixel-watch-deal-sale,"By  Brandon Widder, a senior editor overseeing deals, gift guides, and commerce. He spent six years spearheading buying guides and consumer tech coverage at Digital Trends. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. With each passing day, it seems increasingly unlikely that Apple will introduce a new slate of iPads before the end of April — which isn’t surprising when you consider the latest reports now indicate Apple’s forthcoming tablets won’t arrive until early May. The iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad Mini are all rumored to receive a refresh, though, the same isn’t true of Apple’s entry-level model, which is currently matching its all-time low of $349 ($100) in its base configuration at Amazon and Best Buy. You can also pick it up at Target for the same price if you’re a member of Target Circle, the retailer’s free rewards program. As for where it sits in Apple’s current tablet lineup, the 10th-gen iPad resides somewhere between the ninth-gen model and the latest iPad Air. It cribs many design elements from the latter — including a larger 10.9-inch display, USB-C charging, and a Touch ID fingerprint scanner that’s baked directly into the power button — but it also suffers from some of the same limitations as Apple’s last-gen iPad. It’s only compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil and the new Apple Pencil with USB-C, for one, and it can’t tap into the same accessory ecosystem as the iPad Pro or iPad Air. That said, it’s still an excellent tablet for doing tablet things, one that will allow you to watch movies, read, play games, and even tackle some light productivity tasks in a pinch.  Now, if only Apple hadn’t removed the headphone jack. Apple’s 10th-gen iPad is the spiritual successor to the older ninth-gen model. In exchange for its revised design, landscape-oriented webcam, USB-C port, larger 10.9-inch screen, and faster processor, it ditched the headphone jack and got more expensive. Not to be outdone by Disney Plus and Hulu, Max intends to crack down on password sharing later this year. Fortunately, if you’re willing to pay for an entire year upfront, there’s still time to take advantage of Max’s ongoing March Madness promo, which allows you to save an additional 30 percent on the cost of an annual subscription. The current deal is available to both new and returning subscribers, though, you will need to sign up before the end of today, April 9th, to take advantage of the discount. In terms of pricing, annual Max plans start at $69.99 ($30), which nets out to be $5.83 a month over the course of a year. You can also go ad-free for $104.99 ($50 off) or opt for the Max Ultimate Ad-Free tier for $139.99 ($60 off), the latter of which allows you to stream on four devices at the same time, download more content for offline viewing, and stream select content in 4K UHD with Dolby Atmos. That said, each tier provides access to the same catalog of movies and shows, meaning you’ll be able to s...",-2
"Golden Apple Award: Robin Campbell, Hopewell Elementary School",2024-04-09T22:51:01+00:00,https://www.wdef.com/golden-apple-award-robin-campbell-hopewell-elementary-school/,"Sections About Connect With Us CLEVELAND, Tenn. (WDEF) – The best teachers genuinely care for their students. Kids can tell. That’s certainly the case in Robin Campbell’s 4th grade class at Hopewell Elementary School. For always giving 100%, we decided to give Ms. Campbell this week’s Golden Apple Award. 
 Amber Winters is the Principal at Hopewell. She explains, “Miss Campbell is a fantastic teacher.  Miss Campbell is extremely creative, very loving and caring to her students.  Building relationships with them is one of the things that she works at the most.” When asked to describe herself, Ms. Campbell says,” Robin Campbell is someone who puts her heart and soul into teaching every single day. At home, I enjoy fishing, and we have two baby dogs at home that are a lot.  I just enjoy spending time with my family.” She continues, ” I love teaching.  Teaching was something that was placed in my heart at a very young age.  I knew when I was in third grade that I wanted to become a teacher.  And it has just been in my heart and my soul all those years.” 4th grader Bernadette Augustyn says, “She is just such a loving person, and she teaches everyone well, and she’s just an amazing person.” 4th grader Elijah Fincher chips in, “She’s really nice and she tries her best to teach us in ways that we can understand of how to learn stuff.” 4th grader Noella Thomas adds, “She’s just really caring for her students, and she treats us as her own family.” 4th grader Skylar Henry says, “She’s really nice and she treats a lot of people with kindness.  And she treats us like, really kind, like we’re her own children.” 4th grader Aiden Oliver adds, “She always, never gives up on anyone.  She gives second chances.  She’s loving, caring.  Like teachers that are loving, caring, always willing to spend hours of effort and work into helping students learn.” 4th grader Abby DeVries exclaims, “I love Miss Campbell because she helps us with everything.  Like, if we’re, like, if we’re stuck on a problem, she comes over and helps us.” 4th grader Tristan Millard gives this example, “I used to be a very bad kid until she taught me the lesson not to do that and not now.  I’m a Christian. I believe in Jesus.  I always stay quiet when the teacher’s talking.  I do my work.  I pay attention.” Ms. Campbell concludes, “This has touched me in a way that I didn’t know.  I didn’t know that that’s how they felt about me.  And it makes this job so much more enjoyable and so much it makes me feel appreciated.” Tristan Millard added, “I really appreciate everything she’s done for all of us.”

Apple Watch 10 Could Have Enhanced Battery Life,2024-04-09T22:31:01+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/apple-watch-10-battery-life/,"Published on By The upcoming Apple Watch Series 10 may offer better battery life than its predecessors thanks to a change the company is making to the display.  A supply chain report from South Korean outlet The Elec highlights the potential change. The site claims the device will utilize an improved OLED display with low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) thin-film transistor (TFT) technology. This change should help lower power consumption which means enhanced battery life for users. It’s unclear how big of a change we might see, but it’s a good sign for prospective buyers. The site further claims that LG Display is expected to take the lead role producing the Apple Watch 10’s OLED display. And like other sources, The Elec believes the Apple Watch 10 will arrive in the second half of the year. The Apple Watch 10 will reportedly come with upgrades like blood pressure monitoring and sleep apnea detection. The company is also said to be working on a new mid-range Apple Watch SE 3 which should launch alongside the Series 10 in the fall. Your email address will not be published.

Scepticism Grows Around 2026 Launch Of Foldable iPhones,2024-04-10T00:01:46+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/scepticism-grows-around-2026-launch-of-foldable-iphones/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=scepticism-grows-around-2026-launch-of-foldable-iphones,"Much has been speculated across mainstream media about the plans that Apple has for its foldable iPhones. Now some reports, indicate that the launch date for that device has been pushed from 2026 to 2027 – although there is scepticism among some analysts that the project might be scrapped altogether. Other reports note that Apple has undergone an internal personnel reshuffle. Staff who previously worked on the Vision Pro have now been reportedly sent to work on foldable devices instead. Apple is rumoured to be in the early stages of developing two top-down flip smartphones. South Korea’s Samsung Securities anticipates that the foldable iPhone will feature a 6-inch external display and an 8-inch main display, while also leaving open the possibility of Apple launching a left-right fold product. Apple is reported to be discussing supply orders with LG Display (LGD) and Samsung Display (SDC). Its requirements for panel specifications include a thickness that’s half of the current iPhones and a completely smooth folding crease.  It is also believed to be actively applying for patents related to foldable displays, such as embedded flexible panels within the phone to minimise fold axis creases. In addition, Apple plans to fill displays with polymer materials such as silicone or acrylate to reduce light reflection issues. In addition to the foldable iPhone, Apple is also supposedly working on a folding iPad which will be approximately the size of its iPad Mini and feature an 8-inch screen. While analysts are excited at the prospect of these devices which are, at best, several months away from full-fledged production, Apple is known to abandon projects that it no longer sees a future for within its company – as has been reported to be the case for its car and in-house 5G modem programmes.   02 9002 5900   [email protected] Level 1, 275 Alfred Street

Apple to allow retro game emulators on iOS,2024-04-11T23:06:23+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97355/apple-to-allow-retro-game-emulators-on-ios/index.html,"Apple makes a pre-emptive change in its App Store policies in an effort to head off negative effects from the European Union's new Digital Markets Act (DMA) legislation. The EU's new DMA is changing the face of the digital world as we know it. European lawmakers have used the new act to crack open Apple's ill-favored App Store policies and force some pretty big changes. The biggest shake-up is that Apple must now allow app developers to sell their apps and content on independent third-party stores on iOS, a move that allows developers to circumvent Apple's 30% commission fee. As part of Apple's DMA-sparked changes, retro game emulators will now be unbanned on the App Store and users are free to download and use them. Per Apple's new policy update: 4.7 Mini apps, mini games, streaming games, chatbots, plug-ins, and game emulators Apps may offer certain software that is not embedded in the binary, specifically HTML5 mini apps and mini games, streaming games, chatbots, and plug-ins. Additionally, retro game console emulator apps can offer to download games. You are responsible for all such software offered in your app, including ensuring that such software complies with these Guidelines and all applicable laws. Software that does not comply with one or more guidelines will lead to the rejection of your app. You must also ensure that the software adheres to the additional rules that follow in 4.7.1 and 4.7.5.

Wild footage shows ‘unruly’ migrant mob scuffling with NY cops at shelter,2024-04-11T22:42:04+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/04/11/us-news/wild-footage-shows-unruly-migrant-mob-scuffling-with-ny-cops-at-shelter/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Newly released police bodycam footage captures the moment cops in Yonkers are forced to scuffle with a group of rowdy migrants at a local hotel packed with asylum seekers. Police busted two people during the Tuesday afternoon melee at a local Ramada Inn — but not before they were surrounded and berated in Spanish by an unruly migrant mob, the footage shows. Cops were called to the hotel shortly before 1 p.m. on reports of an out-of-control guest.  “The guy is over here unruly,” a Ramada employee said during a 911 call. “He’s being very violent with everybody. He’s throwing stuff at everybody. We need somebody here right away.” The footage shows the officers walking into the lobby, where they grabbed Arnal Kent, 35, and took him into custody while surrounded by a crew of other migrants. “Why does he have to hit me?” Kent is heard jawing in Spanish as he struggles to get away. “They’re not taking me. They’re not taking me. I’m not doing anything.” That’s when a migrant woman — identified as 24-year-old Yainilet Hernandez — pushes the officers, then blocks the door of the police vehicle to bar cops from putting Kent inside. Yonkers cops manage to get the handcuffed suspect inside — then let things cool down, the video shows. After a few minutes, they go back to Hernandez and try to cuff her, only to have her try to fight off the cops, who are forced to take her to the ground to put the handcuffs on to the taunts of the bystanders. Kent was charged with menacing, disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration and released without bail, police said.  Hernandez was charged with second-degree assault, obstruction of governmental administration and resisting arrest, and was being held at the Westchester County Jail on $500 bail. In a statement Thursday, Yonkers police spokesman Detective Sgt. Frank DiDomizio said police “responded to a call for service and reacted appropriately.” The Ramada Inn on Tuckahoe Road was tapped by New York City officials to take in about 250 migrants in May 2023 as the Big Apple struggled to find space for the flood of asylum seekers.

AirPods Max Vs AirPods Pro 2: Which Is Best For You?,2024-04-11T22:15:11+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1555997/airpods-max-airpods-pro-2-explained-best-for-you/,"
Whether you are looking to purchase new audio gear for your daily intense workout sessions, enjoy an immersive music listening experience, or seamlessly participate in online meetings or online classes, choosing between earbuds or headphones is a tough call. While great options like Galaxy Buds or Sony headphones exist, sticking with Apple might be the way to go if you're already in the Apple ecosystem.





At the time of writing, Apple has two different types of wireless headphones available: The AirPods and the AirPods Max. While the former is available in a Pro model as well and is among the best noise-canceling earbuds out there, the latter is the most premium wireless headset you can purchase from Apple at the time being. While both of these accessories are nowhere near similar design-wise, you'll be surprised to know how similar they are in terms of features.
Another aspect the two accessories differ in significantly is their price point. The increasingly convenient AirPods Pro, which is in its second generation at the time of writing, retails for $248. On the other hand, the impressively feature-packed AirPods Max are priced at $548. Since this is quite a massive difference, it's safe to conclude that the AirPods Pro is definitely a better option if you're on a budget. However, if affordability isn't an issue, keep reading to decide which one is better for you.

Don’t Expect an AirTag 2 This Year,2024-04-11T22:08:20+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/dont-expect-an-airtag-2-this-year/,"Published on By If you’re holding your breath, hoping Apple releases a new AirTag 2 in 2024, stop. Everything we’ve heard suggests the launch is a lot further down the road.  Apple first introduced its AirTag tracker back in 2021. Since then, the accessory’s popularity has soared. And as its grown, so have the questions about the AirTag’s successor or AirTag 2. We often get questions about an AirTag 2 from prospective AirTag buyers because they want to know if the current model is safe to buy or if they should wait for a new model. It’s a legitimate question and one that has a pretty definitive answer. We’ve heard a lot about the products Apple plans to launch in 2024. From new iPad Pros and iPad Air 6, to the iPhone 16 and iOS 18, we’ve got a firm read on what to expect from the company this year. We haven’t, however, heard much about the AirTag 2. Apple could surprise everyone with a launch this year, but an arrival next year is more likely. One of the few people that’s released information about the second-generation AirTag is Apple supply chain analyst, Ming-Chi Kuo. Initially, Kuo believed production of the AirTag 2 would begin in late 2024 which would likely have meant a release in late 2024 or early 2025. In October, Kuo released a revised prediction. He now believes mass production of the AirTag 2 “has been postponed to 2025.” This doesn’t guarantee it will launch in 2025, Apple’s plans often change, but it certainly leaves the door open. The current model was announced in April so we may see Apple use a similar timing for the next model. That, of course, remains to be seen. Not much is known about the AirTag 2. Kuo believes the device might have integration with Apple’s new Vision Pro, but he didn’t elaborate on what that would mean. Other potential features could include a new Ultra Wideband chip which could lead to improvements like better battery life and improved tracking. Your email address will not be published.
