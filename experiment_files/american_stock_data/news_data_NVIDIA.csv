The Acer Predator Helios 18 has the most mesmerizing hinge on a laptop at CES 2024,2024-01-08T23:00:45+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/the-acer-predator-helios-18-has-the-most-mesmerizing-hinge-on-a-laptop-at-ces-2024-230045775.html?src=rss,"Without a new generation of NVIDIA GPUs to accommodate, this year at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, laptop manufacturers have been forced to come up with other ways of getting attention. Some OEMs have opted for complete redesigns while others have introduced smaller (and super light) versions of existing models. But on the 2024 Predator Helios 18, Acer has opted for the flashiest method yet, featuring a captivating new hinge along with updated specs. Compared to last year’s model, the outside of the Helios 18 doesn’t look that much different. It features a familiar matte black chassis and, at 7.17 pounds and 1.14 inches thick, it’s about the same size and weight as well. But then you get to the back where its new hinge is waiting to dazzle you with a seemingly endless series of RGB lights to gawk at. It’s a cool effect that Acer has dubbed the Infinity Mirror lighting bar, and while I’m not sure that alone would cause me to buy one, it’s certainly fun to stare into. All hail the hypno hinge. Aside from that, the other new design change is the introduction of Acer’s MagKey 3.0 on the Helios 18’s WASD buttons, which allows you to swap not only the keycaps but also the mechanical switches beneath for a truly customized gaming experience. The laptop will come with two extra sets of keycaps and switches in the box. I just wish Acer allowed owners to swap out every key and keycap instead of just WASD. Unfortunately, because I only saw a pre-production model, I didn’t have the chance to try it myself. Inside, the Helios 18 has been refreshed with an Intel Core i9-14900X CPU and support for up to 32GB of RAM, 4TB of storage and NVIDIA RTX 4090 graphics. Meanwhile, to keep its operating temps in check, Acer has upgraded to 5th-gen Aeroblade 3D fans and switched to liquid metal thermal grease for improved heat conductivity. And as you’d expect on a system this big and starts at $2,000, the Helios 18 has great connectivity including Wi-Fi 7 and tons of ports (full-size HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, microSD, dual USB-C and more). The Helios 18’s display has also gotten some attention with the move to a 250Hz mini LED panel with a peak brightness of 1,000 nits and a gamut that covers 100 percent of DCI-P3. And while I didn’t get to see it myself, if you don’t want a gaming laptop this big, there will also be a Predator Helios 16 that offers all the same specs (up to an RTX 4090) including a 90 Whr battery, but in a chassis that weighs 5.95 pounds and measures 1.05 inches thick. But it doesn’t stop there because at CES 2024, Acer is announcing more budget-friendly Neo versions of the machines above. Also available with 16- and 18-inch screens, the Predator Helios Neo 18 and Predator Helios Neo 16 come with the same i9-14900X chip, but with a slightly slower 240Hz display and GPU options that cap out at an RTX 4070. Sadly, similar to the Predator Helios 18, the Helios Neo 16 I saw was a pre-production model and had some finishes and speaker grilles that didn’t match the rest of...",2

NVIDIA's RTX 40 Super Cards Have Arrived: Here's How Much They'll Cost You,2024-01-08T19:51:19+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1487721/nvidia-rtx-40-series-super-cards-release-price/,"
NVIDIA has lifted the covers from its souped-up range of ""Super"" graphics cards in the RTX 4000 series, and these come with a welcome price surprise. The three new additions to NVIDIA's lineup are the GeForce RTX 4070 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4080 Super.





Starting at the top of the summit, the RTX 4080 Super GPU will be up for grabs from January 31 onwards with a sticker price of $999. It's a healthy $200 cut compared to the $1,199 asking price for the GeForce RTX 4080. That's an official price cut we are talking about here, but third-party sellers such as Zotac were hawking the RTX 4080 at close to the RTX 4080 Super's asking price a few months ago.
Hardware improvements for the RTX 4080 Super compared to the RTX 4080 include more shader cores (52 TFLOPs vs 49 TFLOPs), more raytracing cores, and stronger Tensor core (836 TFLOPs vs 780 TFLOPs) output. The boost clock speed is also slightly higher at 2.55GHz, but most importantly, the number of CUDA cores has also been bumped up to 10,240, up from the 9,728 CUDA cores crammed inside the older non-Super variant. NVIDIA claims that its latest offering also features faster memory and says the RTX 4080 Super is 1.4 times as fast as its predecessor, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti.

Next in line is the RTX 4070 Ti Super graphics engine. Where the RTX 4080 Super targets 4K ray-traced gaming, this one goes for the 1440p category while offering a taste of 4K visuals. Touted to be 1.6x faster compared to the RTX 3070 Ti, this one also aims to bump up the number of CUDA cores (8,448 vs. 7,680 on the RTX 4070 Ti), delivers a slight bump in the base clock speed, and gets 16GB of memory, eclipsing the 12GB GDDR6 module inside the RTX 4070 Ti.

"Nvidia’s AI-powered NPCs are getting better, but still sound uncanny",2024-01-08T19:39:58+00:00,https://www.polygon.com/24030322/nvidia-ace-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2024,"Filed under: Ubisoft, Mihoyo, and Tencent are using the tech At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) on Monday, Nvidia showed off the latest advancements in its generative AI-powered NPCs, showcasing automated conversations between a player and computer-generated characters that could change how games are made. Nvidia’s Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) tech combines speech-to-text recognition and text-to-speech responses with generative AI facial animation and automated character personas to spit out computer-created character interactions. Nvidia’s special address at CES 2024 featured Seth Schneider, senior product manager of ACE, demoing the technologies working in tandem. According to Schneider, the demo interprets a player’s speech, transforming it into text. That text is then fed to a cloud-based large-language model to generate a response from an NPC. The response text is fed into Omniverse Audio2Face, which lip syncs the generated spoken audio, which is then rendered in-game.

   The demo is an update to a previous version of the tech shown at 2023’s Computex, which featured a character speaking to a futuristic ramen shop owner, Jin. Nvidia’s new demo expands upon that by having Jin and another NPC, Nova, have AI-generated conversations that can be unique on each playthrough. The CES 2024 demo also shows off new technology from another company called Convai, which lets AI-powered NPCs do more than just converse. Those NPCs can also interact with objects in their environment. In the newer demo, Jin is shown pulling out a bottle of booze when prompted to “bring out the good stuff” by Schneider. According to an asset shared by Convai, environment-aware AI NPCs would be able to interact with a number of objects, including bowls, bottles, lights, and other props in the scene. Nvidia says a number of game developers are already utilizing its ACE production services, which includes the Audio2Face facial animation generative AI and Riva automatic speech recognition. Schneider named “top digital avatar developers” like Genshin Impact publisher Mihoyo, NetEase Games, Tencent, and Ubisoft as some of the companies making AI-powered NPCs for their products.

   It’s not clear yet which games will incorporate these types of AI-generated NPCs, but Nvidia and Convai boast the tech will integrate “seamlessly” with game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity. It’s also unclear whether the real-world output will be any good, or like Jin and Nova’s conversation, unnervingly uncanny. Both characters sound robotic and strange in their respective deliveries, despite the clever output of nearly convincing conversations. One thing’s almost guaranteed to come out of Nvidia’s new demo: increased suspicion the bad NPC interactions we’ll experience in future games is crafted by AI instead of an actual human being.

Watch NVIDIA's CES 2024 keynote in 10 minutes,2024-01-08T19:25:33+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/watch-nvidias-ces-2024-keynote-in-10-minutes-192533238.html?src=rss,"NVIDIA was one of the first big-name companies to hold a keynote at CES 2024. If you don't have time to watch the full video but still want to find out how NVIDIA revealed its news, you can watch our supercut, which boils the event down to just under 10 minutes. As expected, the company refreshed its lineup of graphics cards with RTX 40 Super GPUs that are slated to deliver performance boosts at lower prices. The RTX 4080 Super ($999) and RTX 4070 Ti Super ($799) are set to go on sale later this month and are said to be faster than their predecessors. NVIDIA hasn't divulged the full specs of the latest GPUs yet, but the RTX 4070 Ti Super will have 16GB of memory, compared with the previous model's 12GB. With DLSS enabled, the 4080 Super is said to deliver twice the performance of the 3080 Ti. NVIDIA will also offer a mid-range RTX 4070 Super GPU, which will cost $599 and have 20 percent more cores than the previous version. Given the current landscape, NVIDIA had a number of AI products to discuss too. For one thing, it's partnering with Getty Images to offer a text-to-image generative AI service that appears to include intuitive editing tools. The keynote took a look at some of NVIDIA's robotics work as well. NVIDIA also announced several GeForce Now updates. The service will soon support G-Sync as well as day passes, which provide 24 hours of access to the paid tiers. More notable games such as Overwatch 2 and Diablo IV are on the way to the platform, which will soon open for business in Japan. We're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

Nvidia’s RTX 40 Super GPUs deliver more power without price hikes,2024-01-08T18:54:08+00:00,https://www.polygon.com/24030072/nvidia-rtx-40-super-4070-ti-4080-specs-price-launch,"Filed under: The $599.99 RTX 4070 Super ships first on Jan. 17 During CES 2024, Nvidia announced its mid-gen refresh of the GeForce RTX 40 series desktop graphics cards, titled the RTX 40 Super series. Three of its GPUs are getting super-fied: the RTX 4070, the 4070 Ti, and the 4080. Across the board, these GPUs are packed with more everything, from shader and ray tracing cores, to the Tensor AI cores that are integral to making its deep learning supersampling (DLSS) graphics feature work. Nvidia’s blog post covering this announcement goes deeper into the improvements, but here’s the quick version. Each of the three come in at a price that is either the same or slightly cheaper than the original RTX 40 series versions. The lowest-end RTX 4070 Super with 12 GB of GDDR6X video memory is at the same $599.99 price (launching Jan. 17), but its core count puts it much closer to the performance of the RTX 4070 Ti, likely making it a stellar choice for people who want to play games without compromise at 1440p. While its total graphics power has risen to 220 W over the 200 in the RTX 4070, it still requires a 650 W power supply in your PC. Moving up the rungs, the $799.99 RTX 4070 Ti Super is now much closer to the RTX 4080 in terms of performance (seeing a trend here?) than the original model was. That’s due to a boost in cores, plus a jump from 12 GB to 16 GB of video memory. Power requirements are virtually identical between the new and old 4070 Ti versions, requiring at least a 700 W power supply. It’s tough to imagine this card struggling to run anything in 1440p well — or in 4K, depending on the title. This one will debut on Jan. 24. Finally, the RTX 4080 Super is as super as it gets, currently. It’s a similar story for this new $999.99 4K-ready graphics card, with more cores, a minor boost in clock speed, with minor power savings while gaming compared to the original RTX 4080. However, its price is $200 cheaper than the launch price for the RTX 4080. You’ll need a 750 W power supply to use this massive 3-slot GPU. This graphics card will launch on Jan. 31. As with all previous Nvidia GeForce GPU launches, expect to see more than just Nvidia’s own sleek Founders Edition variations hitting the market. More options from other manufacturers will find their way onto shelves, including ones with even higher clock speeds, cooler designs, and flashy RGB lighting.

Watch AMD's CES 2024 keynote in 7 minutes,2024-01-08T18:52:09+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/watch-amds-ces-2024-keynote-in-7-minutes-185209130.html?src=rss,"AMD gave the first big keynote of many to come for CES 2024 and revealed a couple of interesting products arriving this year. Chief among those is the $329 Radeon RX 7600 XT GPU designed for entry-level gaming, going on sale on January 24th. The main takeaway is that it's designed for 1440p gaming and should be a solidly more capable GPU than the RX 7600, though we didn't see any benchmarks against its main rival, NVIDIA's RTX 4060 8GB. The other big news is AI acceleration for the company's Ryzen 8000G desktop processors. Those chips are aimed at folks trying to build capable systems on a budget, with the fastest Ryzen 7 $329 8700G model running eight cores between 4.2GHz and 5.1Ghz, while carrying Radeon 780M graphics. The new NPU (neural processing unit) will speed up AI tasks without hitting your CPU or GPU, enabling features like Windows Studio Effects which can blur your background during video chats, or media editing in Adobe and Blackmagic's DaVinci software. There's a fair bit of information, but we've made it easier by trimming the announcement down to just 7 minutes, while leaving out filler and extra details — so you should be able to catch up over a cup of coffee.

Nvidia RTX 4080 Super vs Nvidia RTX 4080: What's the difference?,2024-01-08T18:11:22+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/versus/nvidia-rtx-4080-super-vs-nvidia-rtx-4080-4406639,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience. If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. The Nvidia RTX 4080 Super was introduced this year, with boosted specs compared to the existing Nvidia RTX 4080 graphics card.  But which specs have been enhanced, and how is that impacted performance? We’re able to answer that question, having recently tested the Nvidia RTX 4080 Super up against its predecessor.  So if you’re not sure which graphics card you should buy, or are considering an upgrade from the RTX 4080, then we’ve created this comparison guide to help make your buying decision easier. Keep reading for the full breakdown.  The Nvidia RTX 4080 Super launched in January 2024 with a recommended retail price of $999/£959. This is surprisingly cheaper than what the Nvidia RTX 4080 was priced at launch, which came in at $1199/£1269. Nvidia says the Super edition will displace the original RTX 4080 in stores, so the latter will soon no longer be available to purchase from retailers. You’ll still likely be able to find it second-hand though.  Asus Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super ROG Strix Gaming OC at Overclockers UK for £1,3499.99 Both the Nvidia RTX 4080 Super and Nvidia RTX 4080 are based on the same Ada Lovelace architecture, which means they both support ray tracing and DLSS 3.5.  However, there are a few minor changes to the specs. The biggest difference between the two graphics cards is that the Nvidia RTX 4080 Super has 5% more CUDA Cores than its vanilla counterpart. Nvidia has confirmed that the RTX 4080 Super will feature 10,240 CUDA Cores. For reference, the Nvidia RTX 4080 has just 9728 CUDA cores. Of course, it’s not a huge increase, so expect a modest performance lift as a result. In order to maximise the performance gains, Nvidia has also increased the boost clock speed for the RTX 4080 Super. The new graphics card is capable of up to a 2.55GHz clock speed, while the standard RTX 4080 is only able to reach a 2.51GHz. Interestingly, both graphics cards share the same base clock speed of 2.21GHz, so it’s best to think of the Super variant as being an overclocked version of the RTX 4080, at least when it comes to clock speeds. Nvidia hasn’t increased the video memory for the Super card either, with both seeing 16GB GDDR6X with a 256-bit memory interface width. Our benchmark tests show that there’s very little separating the performance between the Nvidia RTX 4080 Super and the RTX 4080. Our synthetic benchmark tests put them neck and neck. It was a similar story for the in-game benchmark tests. The Super variant did steal a minor advantage in some games: a 2fps boost in Horizon Zero Dawn and 9fps improvement for Borderlands 3. But more often than not, the performance figures came in almost identical.  Both cards excel at 4K gaming though, capable of hitting 101fps in Red Dead Redemption 2 and 57fps in Total War: Warhammer III. However, the similar performance means there’s no reason to upgrade from an Nv...",0

"RTX 4080 Super vs. RTX 4070 Ti Super vs. RTX 4070 Super: Nvidia’s new GPUs, compared",2024-01-08T17:31:07+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/rtx-4080-super-vs-rtx-4070-ti-super-vs-rtx-4070-super/,"Nvidia’s RTX 40-series refresh is officially here, serving up three of the best graphics cards we’ve seen in a while — the RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and the RTX 4070 Super. The new GPUs, while still belonging to the RTX 40-series, deliver significant changes in specs, making them an interesting choice for PC enthusiasts. While all three of these cards are on the upper end of the spec and price spectrum, they’re not all the same. How do they stack up against each other? Let’s find out with a thorough comparison of Nvidia’s RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti, and RTX 4070 Super. Nvidia unveiled the three new GPUs on January 8 as part of its CES 2024 keynote. Prior to the release, there have been lots of rumors about the RTX 40-series refresh — so much so that most of the specs leaked well ahead of time. However, Nvidia managed to keep the final release dates and the prices mostly under wraps until the day of the announcement. The new graphics cards were all given separate release dates, with the RTX 4070 slated to be the first to show up in stores starting on January 17, 2024. It’s followed by the RTX 4070 Ti Super, launching on January 24, and lastly, the RTX 4080 Super, on January 31. Only one of the GPUs received a change in price in this new iteration, and it’s the one that needed it most. Since the RTX 4080 was one of the worst-value cards of this entire generation, Nvidia seems to have decided to give it a lower price tag this time around, dropping the recommended list price from the $1,200 of the RTX 4080 down to $1,000. The other two cards, the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4070 Super, arrive with the same price tag as their non-Super counterparts, and are priced at $800 and $600, respectively. Of course, models sold by Nvidia’s board partners with higher clocks may cost more, and the prices are expected to be inflated at launch until the demand settles. All of the GPUs come with slightly better specs than their predecessors, but the bump isn’t equally significant for all of them. In fact, the difference between the RTX 4080 and the RTX 4080 Super is fairly small, with no changes to memory size, a small increase in CUDAs, and a measly 50MHz bump in maximum clock speed. The RTX 4070 Ti Super fares better in that regard, getting 8,448 CUDA cores instead of the 7,680 that the RTX 4070 Ti sports. It also provides more memory (16GB versus 12GB), a wider memory bus, and a whole new GPU that makes this possible. The clock speeds remain almost the same. Lastly, the RTX 4070 Super serves up a notable upgrade in CUDA cores (from 5,888 up to 7,168) that brings it closer to the RTX 4070 Ti than the non-Super version of the RTX 4070. However, the memory specs remain the same, as does the clock speed, but the card gets a bump in TGP, adding 20 watts for a total of 220W. In terms of specs, the RTX 4080 Super is the king, but it also received the smallest upgrade over the existing RTX 4080. The RTX 4070 Ti makes for a very interesting choice, with extra ...",2

Should you buy the RTX 4070 or wait for the RTX 4070 Super?,2024-01-08T17:01:28+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/rtx-4070-vs-rtx-4070-super/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? Nvidia’s RTX 4070 is one of the best graphics cards you can buy, and it’s quickly dropping in price at the start of 2024. You might be tempted to pick one up, but with Nvidia’s RTX 4070 Super now here, the choice isn’t as simple as it once was. We’ve had a chance to fully test the RTX 4070 Super now, as you can read about in our RTX 4070 Super review. Coming in at the same price as the original model, this Super refresh manages to exceed expectations in just about every way. And it’s definitely the card you’ll want to pick up in this price bracket. Let’s get the RTX 4070 out of the way. The card launched early last year for a list price of $600, and it’s still widely available at retailers for that price. Later in the year, Nvidia dropped the price to $550 in response to AMD’s RX 7800 XT. You can still find models in stock at $550, and sometimes even for less. Those sales are what make the RTX 4070 so attractive right now. At the time of writing, for example, there’s this , and over the holiday shopping season, I found models as low as $515. Nvidia officially announced the RTX 4070 Super during its keynote at CES on January 8, following months of rumors about the RTX 40-series refresh. The RTX 4070 Super officially launched on January 17, and it will retain the same $600 list price that previously belonged to the RTX 4070. We’ve seen about half a dozen models available at that price, too. Following the announcement about the new GPUs, Nvidia’s officially cutting the price of the RTX 4070 down to $550, so some savings are guaranteed. Although the RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Super share a name, the Super model has a big spec boost. Starting with what’s the same, the RTX 4070 Super delivers the same 12GB of GDDR6X memory we see on the base model and the same bus width. The big change comes in the number of CUDA cores. The RTX 4070 has 5,888 CUDA cores, while the RTX 4070 Super bumps up to 7,168 CUDA cores. That’s almost as many as the RTX 4070 Ti and nearly a 22% increase over the base RTX 4070. The power consumption has been tweaked to reach 220 watts — a minor increase over the card’s predecessor. The card’s boost clock remains unchanged, maxing out at 2,475MHz, as does the 21Gbps bandwidth. While not everything has changed, the changes we’re getting are enough to push the RTX 4070 into a whole new league of graphics cards. In fact, with the updated specs, the RTX 4070 Super is not far off from being a replacement for the non-super RTX 4070 Ti. Both the RTX 4070 and RTX 4070 Super target a 1440p resolution, but the RTX 4070 Super is much faster at that resolution. As you can see above, across our test suite of games, the RTX 4070 Super is somewhere around 11% faster. Keep in mind that these numbers are without Nvidia’s DLSS 3.5, which is available on both cards. The more impressive comparison is to the RTX 4070 Ti, an $800 graphics card Nvidia will soon be retirin...",2
GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER and RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition models look incredible in all black,2024-01-08T16:58:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/95395/geforce-rtx-4070-super-and-4080-founders-edition-models-look-incredible-in-all-black/index.html,"NVIDIA revamped its Founders Edition design for the GeForce RTX GPUs with the GeForce RTX 30 Series, where it introduced one of the most stylish and unique GPU designs in years. From revamped cooling with intake and exhaust fans on each side of the GPU to an all-metal build with intricate fins, it's a look and design language that has carried through to the Ada-powered GeForce RTX 40 Series. NVIDIA's Founders Edition design for the GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs. With NVIDIA announced three new GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs at CES 2024, the company also confirmed that two of the three models (the GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER and GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER) will be getting Founders Edition models. Sadly, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER is missing out. With a similar form factor to the non-SUPER models for these graphics cards, these new Founders Edition cards include the new 'SUPER' branding but with black colored metal instead of the various shades of grey seen in the non-SUPER editions and the 30 Series. It takes an already gorgeous design and makes it look just a little more sleek. Here's a closer look at the GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER and RTX 4080 SUPER Founders Edition models. I can't believe I'm saying this about an all-black GPU without ARGB lighting, but these are stunning - and I (fingers crossed) can't wait to get my hands on one or both soon. The GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER Founders Edition will launch on January 17 at $599 USD, and the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER Founder Edition will launch on January 31 at $999. Available via NVIDIA and select retail partners (like Best Buy in the U.S.), unfortunately, there's no way to pre-order, and they will be sold on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Studios like Tencent and Ubisoft are using NVIDIA ACE to create AI NPCs in upcoming games,2024-01-08T16:42:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/95366/studios-like-tencent-and-ubisoft-are-using-nvidia-ace-to-create-ai-npcs-in-upcoming-games/index.html,"NVIDIA first showcased its new NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) technology created in partnership with Convai back at Computex 2023, with a Cyberpunk-style diner showcasing a fully realized AI character you can interact with (via voice) who will then dynamically respond and react depending on what's happening in the game world. At CES 2024, NVIDIA is presenting an updated version of the diner demo with an additional character in the scene and confirmation that a broad list of developers are now using the technology for game development. Charisma.AI, Convai, Inworld, miHoYo, NetEase, Games, Ourpalm, Tencent, Ubisoft and UneeQ. Tencent calls NVIDIA ACE a ""milestone moment for AI in games"" and will use the tech in upcoming projects. NVIDIA notes that the latest version gives AI NPCs awareness of objects so they can pick them up and drop them off. In addition, NPCs can lead players. Here's an overview and a look at how NVIDIA ACE integrates with the cloud and game engines. With NVIDIA ACE, the player's voice is converted to text and put through cloud-based generative AI before being sent back to the game engine. Facial animation is generated on-the-fly with Audio2Face. NVIDIA ACE in action. Granted, following an NPC to a quest marker isn't exactly the high-watermark of game design, but AI interaction like this could lead to some truly immersive open-world environments. NPCs that dynamically change and react to your actions and events would be a game changer. ACE is a full suite that lets developers build interactive avatars. NVIDIA Audio2Face creates facial animations to match the audio services with NVIDIA Riva using generative AI to offer multilingual speech and translation. Audio2Face and Riva Automatic Speech Recognition microservices are available now. ""Generative AI-powered characters in virtual worlds unlock various use cases and experiences that were previously impossible,"" said Purnendu Mukherjee, founder and CEO at Convai. ""Convai is leveraging Riva ASR and A2F to enable lifelike NPCs with low-latency response times and high-fidelity natural animation."" ""Generative AI technologies are transforming virtually everything we do, and that also includes game creation and gameplay,"" said Keita Iida, vice president of developer relations at NVIDIA. ""NVIDIA ACE opens up new possibilities for game developers by populating their worlds with lifelike digital characters while removing the need for pre-scripted dialogue, delivering greater in-game immersion."" The use of AI for art and other applications that thrive on human creativity is controversial, though this feels like an additive. Using NVIDIA ACE to help flesh out a world, like procedural generation and existing 'simple AI' routines for NPCs, is genuinely exciting. Here's hoping NVIDIA releases a playable demo for this diner scene - it would be super interesting to test out the tech first-hand.

Nvidia makes the case for the AI PC at CES 2024,2024-01-08T16:41:00+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/nvidia-makes-the-case-for-the-ai-pc-at-ces-2024/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular Nvidia announced a wave of ""AI-ready"" laptops from partners using the company's new ""Super"" line of GPUs. Chip giant Nvidia used the Consumer Electronics Show on Monday to unveil several product offerings for consumer technology, the automotive market, and robotics, and unveiled a slew of laptops focused on generative artificial intelligence technology of the ChatGPT sort. ""The big buzz at CES this year is gonna be all about generative AI and AI PCs,"" said Nvidia's senior director of product management, Justin Walker, in a briefing with reporters.  Also: CES 2024: What's Next in Tech In the consumer AI area, Nvidia is positioning the personal computer as a platform for individual use of so-called ""large language models"" such as Meta's Llama 2 program and the popular image program Stable Diffusion.  The company on Monday announced a new series of its RTX graphics cards, called the RTX 40 Super series, that it says can generate video and images 1.7 times faster and 1.5 times faster respectively.  Several PC makers are introducing laptops, which Nvidia referred to as ""AI-ready,"" with the new cards, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and Samsung, which begin shipping this month, Nvidia said. The cards for workstations, in three models, 4070 SUPER, 4070i SUPER, and 4080 SUPER, will go on sale this month for $599, $799, and $999, respectively.  ZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals.

Nvidia did the unthinkable with the RTX 4080 Super,2024-01-08T16:30:50+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-40-series-super-announcement/,"I’m floored. We all knew that Nvidia was releasing new Super graphics cards at CES 2024, but I never expected Nvidia to drop the price with the release of the RTX 4080 Super. The updated model, which will replace the RTX 4080 that released at $1,200, is arriving for $1,000. Nvidia has been the primary driving force behind high GPU prices, but the RTX 4080 Super is a strange change of course that actually brings prices down. A big reason why is that the RTX 4080 Super isn’t too different from the RTX 4080. It’s using the same AD103 GPU, but it comes with the full die, equaling 10,240 CUDA cores. It’s just a 5% bump over the base model, and the Super version comes with the same 16GB of GDDR6X memory and the same 320 watts of power draw. It’s less of a Super refresh and more of a price cut, and that’s not a bad thing. At release, the RTX 4080 was one of the worst values you could find on a GPU. Now, it’s far more competitive, taking the fight to AMD’s RX 7900 XTX with DLSS 3.5 and far better ray tracing performance. As for performance upgrades, Nvidia isn’t making bold claims. The company tells me it expects improvements over the RTX 4080 in the low single digits. Some games may be as much as 5% faster, while others will see no improvement at all. On average, Nvidia says it expects performance improvements around 2% to 3% over the RTX 4080. Of course, we’ve known for a while that Nvidia is launching three Super GPUs. In addition to the RTX 4080 Super, we have the RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Super. These latter two GPUs retain the list price of their non-Super counterparts at $800 and $600, respectively, but they come with a big boost to specs. The RTX 4070 Ti Super will replace the RTX 4070 Ti, but it’s getting an upgrade to the AD103 GPU like the RTX 4080. This one is cut down with 8,448 CUDA cores, and Nvidia says this GPU is about 10% faster than the RTX 4070 Ti on average. The company was careful to point out that this is an average, however. Some games could see as much as a 15% jump. Outside of a core bump, the other big upgrade for the RTX 4070 Ti Super is 16GB of GDDR6X memory. It now comes with the same memory subsystem as the RTX 4080, giving the $800 graphics card a lot room to breathe when it comes to 4K gaming. Finally, the GPU I’m most excited about: the RTX 4070 Super. I’ve been very vocal about the RTX 4070 being a fantastic graphics card, but Nvidia is making it even better. A 20% bump in core count means that it’s 15% faster than the base RTX 4070 on average, according to Nvidia. And it’s coming in at the same $600 price. With the updated specs, the RTX 4070 Super is just a stone’s throw away from the base RTX 4070 Ti. In fact, Nvidia says the new Super model is just 5% slower than the RTX 4070 Ti while costing $200 less. On top of that, Nvidia says the RTX 4070 Super is faster than an RTX 3090 — a GPU that released for $1,500 — and that’s without any frame generation shenanigans. Interestingly, this is the only Super model that...",2
"NVIDIA reveals RTX 40 Super GPUs at CES 2024, including the $999 4080 Super",2024-01-08T16:30:41+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-reveals-rtx-40-super-gpus-at-ces-2024-163041585.html?src=rss,"After rounding out its RTX 40 GPUs in 2023 with the RTX 4060 and 4060 Ti, NVIDIA has brought the inevitable follow-ups to CES 2024: slightly faster Super cards! In Las Vegas today, NVIDIA has unveiled the RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Super GPUs, upgrades over its previous GPUs which aim to compete directly with AMD's cheaper high-end cards. And of course, NVIDIA can't help but tout how useful they'll be for on-device AI tasks. The RTX 4080 Super will sell for $999 when it arrives on January 31, while the RTX 4070 Ti Super will go for $799 on January 24th. AMD's Radeon 7900 XTX and XT launched at $999 and $899 a year ago — now NVIDIA has high-end options that don't involve shelling out $1,199 for the original RTX 4080 or an eye-watering $1,599 for the RTX 4090. For most buyers though, the mid-range $599 RTX 4070 Super may be the most compelling value when it lands on January 17. NVIDIA isn't divulging the full specs for these cards yet, but it says the RTX 4080 Super is twice as fast as the 3080 Ti in games while using DLSS 3 Frame Generation. Recent leaks suggest it'll have 10,240 CUDA cores, compared to 9,728 on the 4080, as well as faster clock speeds and beefier 23 Gbps memory. The RTX 4070 Ti will get a very helpful 16GB memory upgrade (instead of 12GB on the previous card), which edges it closer to the 20GB VRAM the Radeon 7900 XT. The RTX 4070, meanwhile, will sport 20 percent more cores than the original model to be ""faster than an RTX 3090 at a fraction of the power,"" according to NVIDIA.

"Ubisoft, Tencent will begin using Nvidia’s AI-generated NPC tools",2024-01-08T16:30:14+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nvidia-ace-microservices-ubisoft-announcement/,"Update 1/11: Following backlash over its ambiguous comments about data usage, Nvidia now clarifies that its Ace microservice is trained exclusively on data that Nvidia has the rights to, through partners and open-source datasets. The original story continues below. Nvidia announced an expansion of its previously revealed AI game-making tool, Nvidia Ace, at CES 2024. Now available to partners as Ace Production Microservices, gaming companies will be able to use specific pieces of the multifaceted tool that’s capable of generating AI-generated video game characters. Ubisoft and Tencent are among the first major studios utilizing the process. Nvidia Ace is a platform that allows creators to generate non-playable characters (NPCs) via AI. Nvidia achieves this with several different tools. Characters can be dynamically rendered into a game scene and an audio lip-sync tool can make it so their mouths match up with what they’re saying. The tool is also able to translate player speech to text, feed it to the AI NPC, and spit out a response via a separate text-to-speech tool. In short, it can create fully voiced, dynamic video game characters. While Nvidia Ace itself isn’t new, the microservice opens the entire pipeline up to partners. Now, developers can use one piece of the toolset, rather than the full closed system. As part of the announcement, Nvidia revealed that several big-name publishers are already on board. Both Ubisoft and Tencent are partners, though its currently unclear how each publisher intends to use the service. Other partners include Charisma, Convai, Inworld, NetEase, Ourpalm, UneeQ and Genshin Impact developer MiHoYo. Also unclear is what data Ace is trained on. When we asked about the data set use to generate writing and voices, Nvidia noted that there’s “no simple answer.” It pointed out that it’s using several AI tools within Ace and each one can be trained on different data sets. It’s likely not the firm answer that opponents of AI in video games want to hear, even if it is a common refrain in the tech space. For instance, Nvidia’s stance leaves questions about whether or not the tool is trained on voice actors who have willingly agreed to use their voice for AI. Ace’s potential integration into major titles by a company like Ubisoft is sure to spark some conversations among artists who seemingly can’t be assured that their work isn’t part of the training data. When it comes to putting together a gaming setup, you can always build a gaming PC from scratch, but if you’re looking for some savings, there are often deals taking place on gaming PCs with pre-spec’d builds to take advantage of. There are certainly a lot of gaming PC deals taking place right now, and among them are some of the best desktop computer deals we’ve seen. So whether you’re a light gamer or want to find the right piece of equipment for taking on the best PC games, we’ve rounded up what we feel are not only the best PC deals out there, but the best PC deals for ...",3
Getty and Nvidia bring generative AI to stock photos,2024-01-08T16:30:00+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24027259/getty-images-nvidia-generative-ai-stock-photos,"By  Emilia David, a reporter who covers AI. Prior to joining The Verge, she covered the intersection between technology, finance, and the economy. Getty Images and Nvidia are deepening their AI partnership with the launch of Generative AI by iStock, a text-to-image platform specifically designed to make stock photos.  Generative AI by iStock builds on Getty’s first foray into AI image generation, Generative AI by Getty Images. The difference is that the image platform from iStock — a stock photo service owned by Getty — helps individual or single-seat users, unlike Getty Images, which is more of a multiuser enterprise solution. Trained using Nvidia’s Picasso model, Generative AI by iStock only learned from Getty’s creative library and iStock’s stock photo library. It did not train on Getty’s editorial image library to prevent it from generating trademarks or known personalities. “It allows users to be more efficient in their workflow and get more precise photos that they need” Grant Farhall, Getty’s chief product officer, tells The Verge that Generative AI by iStock targets small and medium businesses that need to find stock photos.  “It allows users to be more efficient in their workflow and get more precise photos that they need, even something that they can’t feasibly do with a camera,” Farhall says. He used the example of someone looking for photos to illustrate climate change: they can prompt Generative AI by iStock to create a picture of penguins walking through a city street; instead of hiring a photographer and finding a flock of penguins, the AI can make that for them.  Pricing will be $14.99 for 100 prompts, with each prompt generating four images. Another big difference between the Getty Images AI platform and the new iStock service revolves around legal indemnity. Unlike Generative AI by Getty Images, users will not have unlimited indemnification. The iStock platform will have a cap of $10,000 per asset, the same license it offers for its current library. As with Getty’s first generative AI platform, contributors whose content was used to train the model can participate in a revenue sharing program. The iStock platform will also gain Inpainting and Outpainting features “soon,” Alexander Lazarou, a Getty spokesperson, told The Verge. Inpainting lets users mask an area of an image and then fill it in with a person or object from a text prompt. Outpainting expands a photo for different aspect ratios and fills those new regions. Correction January 8th, 12:43PM ET: Inpainting and outpainting are launching “soon” and will not be offered at launch, as this article initially stated. This story also said “customers” could participate in revenue sharing; it is photo contributors who participate in the program.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Nvidia’s RTX 4080 Super arrives on January 31st at a more reasonable $999,2024-01-08T16:19:52+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24028636/nvidia-rtx-4080-super-4070-ti-specs-release-date-pricing,"By  Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Nvidia is introducing three RTX 40-series Super cards this month that offer more performance at price points that are similar or better than existing cards. Pricing of the RTX 40-series has been a sticking point for gamers, particularly for the RTX 4080. Nvidia is replacing this GPU with the RTX 4080 Super and cutting the price to $999 when it launches on January 31st. The $200 price cut will put a lot of pressure on AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 XT ($899) and XTX ($999) cards. Before the RTX 4080 Super launches, there’s also the RTX 4070 Super on January 17th priced at $599 and the RTX 4070 Ti Super, with some interesting changes, on January 24th at $799. Nvidia is also phasing out the RTX 4070 Ti but keeping the RTX 4070 around at a lower $549 price point. The RTX 4080 Super ships with Nvidia’s full AD103 chip, so it’s not cut down like the RTX 4080 before it. There are more CUDA cores and faster memory at 736GB/s of bandwidth, and it ships with the same 16GB of G6X and can draw up to 320 watts of power.  Nvidia is aiming the RTX 4080 Super at existing RTX 3080 Ti or RTX 2080 Super owners, rather than RTX 40-series adopters. The performance bump over an RTX 4080 should be between 1 and 5 percent, depending on the games, so essentially, it’s RTX 4080-level performance (or better) for $200 less. The RTX 4070 Ti Super looks like it could be the most interesting card out of the trio of RTX 40-series Super GPUs. Nvidia is increasing the memory to 16GB of G6X, and it’s being upgraded to the 256-bit memory bus found on the RTX 4080 / 4090 cards instead of the 192-bit bus on the original RTX 4070 Ti. Combined with more CUDA cores, this feels like a bigger upgrade than the RTX 4080 Super changes. While it will remain at $799, you’re getting more memory and performance. Nvidia says you should see around 10 percent more performance with the RTX 4070 Ti Super compared to the original RTX 4070 Ti. Nvidia hasn’t had to sacrifice more power consumption to offer this improved performance, either. The RTX 4070 Ti Super will ship with the same up to 285 watts of power draw as the original, but there won’t be a Founders Edition variant of this card. Nvidia claims the new RTX 4070 Super will be faster than an RTX 3090 while using less power at up to a 220-watt draw. That’s only 20 watts more than the original RTX 4070, which was able to offer similar performance to the RTX 3080 at 1440p. While it remains on the same 192-bit memory bus and 12GB of G6X memory, Nvidia is bumping the CUDA core count to give it a performance boost. The RTX 4070 Super will ship on January 17th at the same $599 price point as the original, which might make it a more tempting upgrade for existing RTX 3070 or 2070 owners. Nvidia also claims there will be around a 15 percent performance increase from the original RTX 4070 to the...",0
Nvidia’s GeForce Now is getting cloud G-Sync support and streaming day passes,2024-01-08T16:15:29+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24029674/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-g-sync-day-pass-support,"By  Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. Nvidia is bringing its G-Sync technology to the cloud with GeForce Now. The support will be added soon, according to Nvidia, allowing variable refresh rate monitors to match the streaming rate of games from Nvidia’s GeForce Now cloud gaming service. Nvidia first supported 120fps output on its RTX 3080 tier of GeForce Now in 2021 and soon bumped this to up to 240fps on its RTX 4080 servers last year. It was backed by Nvidia’s Reflex technology, which evaluates and decreases system latency in games. Now, that same Reflex tech is being expanded to work with 4K titles and 60 / 120fps streaming modes. “With both Cloud G-SYNC and Reflex, members will feel as if they’re connected directly to GeForce Now’s RTX 4080 SuperPODs, making their visual experiences smoother, clearer and more immersive than ever,” claims Nvidia. Nvidia is also offering a 1440p streaming option on Android, ideal for tablets and phones with larger screens. GeForce Now members will also be able to turn their Android devices into a portable gaming rig, connecting their device to a 1080p or 1440p gaming monitor or TV to stream games. While Nvidia’s top GeForce Now Ultimate membership has long been impressive for cloud gaming, the $19.99 per month pricing is a high bar of entry for anyone looking to try it out before committing to a subscription. Nvidia will start offering day passes in early February, offering access to either priority GeForce Now or the Ultimate membership benefits. Ultimate day passes, which include the all-important RTX 4080 access, will be available for $7.99 and Priority priced at $3.99. Nvidia’s partnership with Microsoft to bring Xbox and Activision Blizzard PC games to GeForce Now continues soon with the addition of Diablo IV and Overwatch 2. Support for the Battle.net launcher will follow soon, too. While Diablo IV launched with DLSS 3 support, it’s also getting ray tracing in March. GeForce Now is also launching in Japan in the spring, with new data centers opening in Poland, Chile, and Thailand. This latest expansion means GeForce Now is available in 110 countries.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Intel may already be conceding its fight against Nvidia,2024-01-16T20:03:22+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/intel-battlemage-may-already-concede-to-nvidia/,"Nvidia continues to own the top-of-the-line GPU space, and the competition just hasn’t been able to, well, compete. The announcement of the impressive-sounding RTX 40 Super cards cements the lead even further. As a result, AMD is said to be giving up on the high-end graphics card market with its next-gen GPUs. And now, a new rumor tells us that Intel might be doing the same with Arc Battlemage, its anticipated upcoming graphics cards that are supposed to launch later this year. While this is bad news, it’s not surprising at all. First, let’s talk about what’s new. Intel kept quiet about Arc Battlemage during CES 2024, but Tom Petersen, Intel fellow, later revealed in an interview that it’s alive and well. The cards might even be coming out this year, although given Intel’s track record for not meeting GPU deadlines, 2025 seems like a safer bet. But what kind of performance can we expect out of these new graphics cards? This is where YouTuber RedGamingTech weighs in. RedGamingTech posted a big update to Intel Arc Battlemage specs in his latest video, and it doesn’t sound particularly good for high-end gaming enthusiasts. According to the YouTuber, the specifications of the flagship chip may be significantly different compared to his previous predictions. What’s worse, it might never even be released. Initially, RedGamingTech suggested that the top Battlemage GPU would feature 56 Xe cores and a frequency of up to 3GHz. That’s still the case, but rumor has it that there’s been a big shake-up in memory bus and cache configuration. Instead of the 256-bit bus and the 116MB of L2 cache, the YouTuber now says that we can expect a 192-bit bus, 8MB of L2 cache, and a whopping 512MB of Adamantine cache. Adamantine cache is still pretty unknown to us at this stage, although an Intel patent that PCGamer shared details on tells us more about it. It’s essentially Level 4 cache that’s comparable to AMD’s Infinity Cache and appears to work in a similar way. That sounds pretty good, right? With 56 Xe cores, the card would be a huge upgrade over the Arc A770 that comes with 32 cores. However, even despite this massive L4 cache, those specs already hint at a less-than-high-end flagship for Intel. With a 192-bit bus, Intel would probably stop at around 12GB of VRAM, unless it ends up feeling adventurous like AMD with the RX 7600 XT or Nvidia with the RTX 4060 Ti. (Let’s hope that it won’t.) Regardless of whether this GPU is even real, RedGamingTech suspects that Intel may choose not to release it at all due to unsatisfactory profit margins. Instead, Intel might focus on a GPU with 40 Xe cores, a 192-bit memory bus, 18MB of L2 cache, and zero “Adamantine” cache. AMD is reportedly bowing out of the high-end GPU race in this next generation. Now, Intel is said to be doing the same. Where does that leave Nvidia? Right at the very top, with complete control of the enthusiast GPU market and nothing to worry about in that regard. It’s a dream for Nvidia, but it’s not so gre...",3

Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super tests: 5 key things you need to know,2024-01-16T15:22:34+00:00,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2202988/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-super-tests-5-key-things-you-need-to-know.html,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. A mere week after unveiling the GeForce RTX 4070 Super (and its siblings, the RTX 4070 Ti Super and 4080 Super) at CES 2024, Nvidia’s $599 graphics card is already primed to launch. Review embargoes lifted for Nvidia’s new 1440p champion this morning ahead of a full release tomorrow morning. I’ve got the Founders Edition version of the card in hand but a severe case of the infamous post-CES plague prevented me from evaluating it fully. Fortunately, a host of other independent reviewers have done testing, and Nvidia’s latest GPU looks like a superstar. Here are five things you need to know about the $599 GeForce RTX 4070 Super. Nvidia’s biggest change to the GeForce RTX 4070 Super is the infusion of a whopping 20 percent more CUDA, ray tracing, and tensor cores in this new model, all at the same price as its vanilla namesake. Unsurprisingly, this results in a big boost in gaming performance: “Averaged over the 25 games in our test suite, at 1440p, we find the RTX 4070 Super Founders Edition 15% faster than the RTX 4070 non-Super, which is a pretty substantial improvement for a refresh,” declares TechPowerUp, a margin substantiated by other reviewers. “This means that the card is able to match last generation’s RTX 3090 flagship, and the gap to RTX 4070 Ti shrinks to just 8%… While AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT was a bit faster than RTX 4070 in pure raster scenarios, this has changed with the RTX 4070 Super, which is now 7% faster.” That’s a huge leap – and one that will no doubt help the RTX 4070 Super usurp the Radeon RX 7800 XT on our list of the best graphics cards. AMD’s rival often outpunched the RTX 4070 non-Super despite costing $100 less but that’s not the case with the Super. Killer Nvidia performance-boosting AI technologies like DLSS, Frame Generation, and RTX Video Super Resolution can all push frame rates even further in games that support them. This is what the RTX 4070 should have been at launch. All those extra cores push the RTX 4070 Super’s ray tracing prowess to new heights, too. “Ray tracing performance also scales similarly, at least when comparing the 4070 Super to the OG 4070 and the 4070 Ti,” KitGuru writes. “It is significantly faster than the RX 7800 XT over the eight games we tested with ray tracing enabled, to the tune of 47% on average, while it’s in the same class as the RX 7900 XTX.” That’s a $1,000 AMD Radeon graphics card, for those keeping score. Ray tracing is a strength for Nvidia and the RTX 4070 Super pushes the pedal to the metal. Adam Patrick Murray / IDG Adam Patrick Murray / IDG Adam Patrick Murray / IDG More power requires, well, more power. The GeForce RTX 4070 Super has its “total graphics power” rating bumped to 220 watts, 20W more than the vanilla 4070. It also transitions purely to Nvidia’s 16-pin power connector. It seems like a worthwhile sacrifice for the performance on offer....",3

Nvidia RTX 4070 Super review: It’s back on top,2024-01-16T14:00:44+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-4070-super-review/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? Nvidia needed a response. The RTX 4070 has held strong as one of the best graphics cards you can buy, but after losing some positions to AMD’s cheaper RX 7800 XT, Nvidia needed to come back with a vengeance. The result is the RTX 4070 Super, a GPU that not only reaffirms Nvidia’s position at the top of this price bracket but also calls into question the other GPUs Nvidia has released this generation. The RTX 4070 Super is part of a trio of GPUs that Nvidia is giving the Super treatment to, and I suspect it will remain the most impressive. It packs the largest spec bump out of the entire range, and based on the performance I’m seeing, that makes a world of difference for this $600 GPU. The RTX 4070 Super has a massive spec upgrade. It’s still on the AD104 GPU like the base RTX 4070, but Nvidia bumped the core count massively. You’re getting a 20% increase in CUDA cores, totaling 7,168 cores. That’s nearly as many as the $800 RTX 4070 Ti has. The core count is the main draw here, but Nvidia also bumped up power just a bit. The RTX 4070 Super has a Total Graphics Power (TGP) of 220 watts, while the base model came in at 200W. It’s not a massive change realistically, especially given the remarkable efficiency we’ve seen from Nvidia this generation. A little extra juice doesn’t hurt here, giving the cores more power to play with. That’s what’s different, but Nvidia kept some of the specs the same. Namely, the memory interface on the RTX 4070 Super is identical to the base model. You’re getting 12GB of GDDR6X memory on a 192-bit bus, along with 48MB of L2 cache to improve the bandwidth over that more narrow bus. Even among VRAM concerns in games, 12GB shouldn’t be too limiting. There are rare cases where it can become an issue at 4K with ray tracing, but those aren’t realistic gameplay settings for the RTX 4070 Super. In addition, the clock speed remains mostly the same, with a boost block of 2.48GHz. The base clock speed has a slight bump, but as we’ve seen from GPUs over the past several generations, most models are already pushed to the brink of clock speed out of the box. How does a 20% boost in core count translate into real performance? It’s not quite linear scaling, but the RTX 4070 Super still manages to impress. 3DMark is actually a very important benchmark for the RTX 4070 Super. Remember, this card is still based on Nvidia’s Ada Lovelace architecture, so some games will appreciate the bump in cores more than others. 3DMark provides a nice foundation to understand where the card lands overall. Compared to the RTX 4070 in 3DMark Time Spy, the Super model comes in 17% faster. That’s a massive improvement, putting Nvidia ahead of not only the 12GB RTX 3080 but also AMD’s RX 7800 XT. Perhaps more impressive is how close the Super model gets to the RTX 4070 Ti. The base RTX 4070 Ti is only 7% faster despite being 33% more expensive. Time Spy is an aging benc...",3

"Power Plays: MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META dominate market moves",2024-01-16T12:00:00+00:00,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/power-plays-msft-nvda-googl-meta-dominate-market-moves/," Last week, an interesting picture of triumph was painted in the stock market, with the technology sector taking the lead. Now, this may come as no surprise. The stars of the show were none other than several members of the so-called Magnificent Seven – Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta. It was primarily thanks to these titans of the global markets that clear outperformance was achieved in their participating industries. Considering their capitalization, these four members of the magnificent seven outperformed in the sector and their industries, helping the overall market close the week up an impressive 1.87%. Thanks to that dominant performance, the market has swung to positive territory on the year, up almost 0.3%. So, with the first two weeks of the year in the books and witnessing the market seamlessly continuing its momentum from the previous year, one cannot help but wonder – will this trend persist throughout the year? Well, let’s delve deeper into each industry, exploring how these titans of the technology sector have set the stage for outperformance continuation. In the software kingdom, Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT reigned supreme. Its stock performance spoke volumes, as it closed the week up an impressive 5.63% and overtook Apple NASDAQ: AAPL to become the world's most valuable company.  The dominant performance came after the stock broke out of its multi-month consolidation and traded to a new all-time high of $390.68. Analysts continue to favor the software giant, placing a Moderate Buy rating and price target forecasting further upside.  Notably, as the breakout experienced momentum, two analysts took bullish action on the stock. BMO Capital Markets increased its price target from $400 to $420, and Piper Sandler reiterated its rating of Overweight with a $455 price target. The semiconductor industry experienced notable relative strength last week, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF NASDAQ: SMH closing the week up an impressive 4.14%. Surprise, surprise, its dominant industry player and top holding Nvidia NASDAQ: NVDA stole the spotlight. Nvidia’s stellar performance last week once again highlighted the crucial role of semiconductors in powering modern technology, making it one of the key players to watch this year.  Like Microsoft, Nvidia broke out of a multi-month consolidation last week and experienced terrific momentum and an uptick in volume. As a result of breaking above significant resistance at $500, the stock closed the week up over 11% and achieved a new all-time high of $553.46. Now, turning our attention to the internet content and information industry, Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOGL and Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META stood out for their dominance. Alphabet, Google's parent company, oversees YouTube, Waymo, Mandiant, and various subsidiaries, dominating online search with over 90% of the market. Meta, formerly Facebook, rebranded in 2021, focusing on the metaverse and fostering social interaction across applications like Instagram and ...",3

AMD believes it now has the edge over NVIDIA when it comes to frame-generation technology,2024-01-16T00:28:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/95546/amd-believes-it-now-has-the-edge-over-nvidia-when-comes-to-frame-generation-technology/index.html,"AMD and NVIDIA are the two biggest players when it comes to discrete gaming GPUs, but with its dominant market share and recent innovations like DLSS Super Resolution, Reflex latency reduction, and DLSS 3 Frame Generation, the consensus by many is that NVIDIA leads while AMD follows. HYPR-RX is a driver-based solution that brings frame generation to all Radeon RX 6000 and RX 7000 owners. In the case of DLSS, AMD's FSR or FidelityFX Super Resolution took a while to hit the market - with FSR 2 proving to be a success regarding image quality. In the case of FSR 3, which includes frame generation and super-resolution upscaling, it took almost a year after the arrival of DLSS 3 for AMD's equivalent tech to appear in a few select games. Unlike NVIDIA's DLSS 3, FSR 3 works on all GPUs - Radeon and GeForce alike - but still requires per-game implementation by developers. The company's latest endeavor, HYPR-RX, brings upscaling and frame generation versions to drivers - meaning they can be instantly enabled in hundreds of games. And with this, AMD believes it now has the edge over NVIDIA. And maybe it's Team Green's turn to play catch-up. ""I would be curious to know if NVIDIA feels now they have to match what we've done in making some of these solutions driver-based,"" AMD's Aaron Steinman told PC Gamer in a recent interview. DLSS 2 Super Resolution is exclusive to GeForce RTX GPUs, while DLSS 3 Frame Generation is exclusive to the latest GeForce RTX 40 Series due to using new specialized AI hardware. ""DLSS is only available on certain solutions,"" Steinman adds. ""So either NVIDIA will have to benefit from our solution because we did make it open-source and cross-vendor, or they're probably going to need to do something similar."" Granted, a driver-based solution for upscaling for GeForce owners has existed for a while - NVIDIA Image Scaling is working similarly to AMD's FSR. The driver-based HYPR-RX combo of Radeon Super Resolution (RSR) and AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) lets these technologies be applied to hundreds of games. Still, image quality and overall stability aren't on par with game-specific integration that uses motion vectors and other data. AFMF is currently in Preview form, with it set to officially launch alongside the new Radeon RX 7600 XT later this month. The reason DLSS is the gold standard for upscaling comes down to its use of AI and being integrated into a game, and the same goes for DLSS 3 Frame Generation. With DLSS 3 adoption on the rise, it's unlikely that the company will release a driver-based version of the technology, as the company has gone all in on leveraging AI hardware and its supercomputers to deliver image quality that is on par with or even superior to native rendering. This is why DLSS has made upscaling and frame generation a hot topic. AMD's non-AI algorithm approach is exciting for being open-vendor, and tech like AMD Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) has the potential to be a game changer as it improves - so either way, ...",0

Rumor suggests RTX 3050 6GB is nerfed so much we wonder why NVIDIA is bothering with this GPU,2024-01-15T19:52:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/95589/rumor-suggests-rtx-3050-6gb-is-nerfed-so-much-we-wonder-why-nvidia-bothering-with-this-gpu/index.html,"NVIDIA's RTX Super refreshes might be grabbing all the limelight right now, but there's a budget move afoot (in theory) that's much more under the radar with the old RTX 3050. The original RTX 3050 with 8GB of VRAM is pretty much sold out at this point in time (Image Credit: NVIDIA) Rumors have been circulating for a while now about a new take on Ampere's RTX 3050 which has 6GB of VRAM (rather than 8GB), but a new leak suggests that the spec could be cut down more than just having the video memory reduced. This isn't the first time we've heard theorizing that the RTX 3050 6GB might be reined in quite a bit, disappointingly for gamers on a budget, but the new specs here are quite a drop down indeed. And they're confusing in that they both agree with, and simultaneously contradict, another recent leak from a Russian retailer. This new leak highlighted by VideoCardz (via Tom's Hardware) shows the RTX 3050 6GB having its CUDA cores dropped to 2304 (from 2560), on top of having both the base and boost clocks hugely reduced. Supposedly the new boost speed is 1470MHz and the base clock is just 1042MHz (a third slower than the RTX 3050 8GB). Now, the previous leak from the retailer did show a base clock of 1,042MHz, but according to those product listings (for Palit models), the CUDA core configuration is the same as the 8GB version of the RTX 3050. So, we're not sure if this CUDA core reduction is happening, but if so, it's certainly going to compound the misery of much slower clock speeds and a 2GB drop in video memory. Frankly, the end result could end up so hamstrung by these cutbacks that it makes us wonder why NVIDIA would bother with it - which gives us some doubt around the accuracy of this new leak. With a previously rumored price of $179 in the US - add plenty of salt here, and with all of this - an RTX 3050 6GB reduced in power by this much wouldn't make sense compared to the rivals from AMD in this space. (Notably the RX 6600). Maybe NVIDIA is mulling a cheaper price tag than that? Or maybe these spec rumors are considerably off the mark? Whatever's the truth behind this, we'll find out soon enough, because we aren't far off the launch of the RTX 3050 6GB, at least not if the grapevine is right. We're told this refreshed graphics card is due to arrive in February 2024, so it's right around the corner. Meanwhile, throughout the rest of January, that trio of RTX Super refreshes are set to emerge, starting with the RTX 4070 Super which is out on January 17.

 China is still finding ways to skirt US export controls on Nvidia chips, Reuters reported. A Reuters review of publicly available tender documents showed that last year dozens of entities—including ""Chinese military bodies, state-run artificial intelligence research institutes, and universities""—managed to buy ""small batches"" of restricted Nvidia chips. The US has been attempting to block China from accessing advanced chips needed to achieve AI breakthroughs and advance modern military technologies since September 2022, citing national security risks. Reuters' report shows just how unsuccessful the US effort has been to completely cut off China, despite repeated US attempts to expand export controls and close any loopholes discovered over the past year. China's current suppliers remain ""largely unknown,"" but Reuters confirmed that ""neither Nvidia"" nor its approved retailers counted ""among the suppliers identified."" An Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters that the company ""complies with all applicable export control laws and requires its customers to do the same."" ""If we learn that a customer has made an unlawful resale to third parties, we'll take immediate and appropriate action,"" Nvidia's spokesperson said. It's also still unclear how suppliers are procuring the chips, which include Nvidia's most powerful chips, the A100 and H100, in addition to slower modified chips developed just for the Chinese market, the A800 and H800. The former chips were among the first banned, while the US only began restricting the latter chips last October. Among military and government groups purchasing chips were two top universities that the US Department of Commerce has linked to China's principal military force, the People's Liberation Army, and labeled as a threat to national security. Last May, the Harbin Institute of Technology purchased six Nvidia A100 chips to ""train a deep-learning model,"" and in December 2022, the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China purchased one A100 for purposes so far unknown, Reuters reported. Other entities purchasing chips include Tsinghua University—which is seemingly gaining the most access, purchasing ""some 80 A100 chips since the 2022 ban""—as well as Chongqing University, Shandong Chengxiang Electronic Technology, and ""one unnamed People's Liberation Army entity based in the city of Wuxi, Jiangsu province."" In total, Reuters reviewed more than 100 tenders showing state entities purchasing A100 chips and dozens of tenders documenting A800 purchases. Purchases include ""brand new"" chips and have been made as recently as this month. Most of the chips purchased by Chinese entities are being used for AI, Reuters reported. None of the purchasers or suppliers provided comments in Reuters' report. Nvidia's highly sought-after chips are graphic processing units capable of crunching large amounts of data at the high speeds needed to fuel AI sy...",-2

China’s military and government acquire Nvidia chips despite US ban,2024-01-15T02:13:01+00:00,https://www.bworldonline.com/technology/2024/01/15/568901/chinas-military-and-government-acquire-nvidia-chips-despite-us-ban/," BEIJING – Chinese military bodies, state-run artificial intelligence research institutes and universities have over the past year purchased small batches of Nvidia semiconductors banned by the US from export to China, a Reuters review of tender documents show. The sales by largely unknown Chinese suppliers highlight the difficulties Washington faces, despite its bans, in completely cutting off China’s access to advanced US chips that could fuel breakthroughs in AI and sophisticated computers for its military. Buying or selling high-end US chips is not illegal in China and the publicly available tender documents show dozens of Chinese entities have bought and taken receipt of Nvidia semiconductors since restrictions were imposed. These include its A100 and the more powerful H100 chip – whose exports to China and Hong Kong were banned in September 2022 – as well as the slower A800 and H800 chips Nvidia then developed for the Chinese market but which were also banned last October. The graphic processing units – a type of chip – that are built by Nvidia are widely seen as far superior to rival products for AI work as they can more efficiently process huge amounts of data needed for machine-learning tasks. The continued demand for and access to banned Nvidia chips also underlines the lack of good alternatives for Chinese firms despite the nascent development of rival products from Huawei and others. Prior to the bans, Nvidia commanded a 90% share of China’s AI chip market. Purchasers included elite universities as well as two entities subject to US export restrictions – the Harbin Institute of Technology and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, which have been accused of involvement in military matters or being affiliated to a military body contrary to US national interest. The former purchased six Nvidia A100 chips in May to train a deep-learning model. The latter purchased one A100 in December 2022. Its purpose was not identified. None of the purchasers mentioned in this article responded to requests for comment. The Reuters review found neither Nvidia nor retailers approved by the company were among the suppliers identified. It was not clear how the suppliers have procured their Nvidia chips. In the wake of US curbs, however, an underground market for such chips in China has sprung up. Chinese vendors have previously said they snatch up excess stock that finds its way to the market after Nvidia ships large quantities to big US firms, or import through companies locally incorporated in places such as India, Taiwan and Singapore. Reuters sought comment from 10 of the suppliers listed in tender documents including those mentioned in this article – none of them answered. Nvidia said it complies with all applicable export control laws and requires its customers to do the same. “If we learn that a customer has made an unlawful resale to third parties, we’ll take immediate and appropriate action,” a company spokesperson said.

Nvidia’s Red-Hot 2024 Start A Bright Spot As S&P 500 Eyes Record,2024-01-15T01:39:29+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/nvidia-s-red-hot-2024-start-a-bright-spot-as-s-p-500-eyes-record,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. is off to its strongest-ever start to a year by one measure, keeping up a blistering rally that saw shares gain nearly 240% in 2023.  The artificial-intelligence darling has added roughly $128 billion in market capitalization after rising about 10% this month, an unprecedented gain in value in the first nine trading days of the year for the company. It’s a boon for Nvidia bulls and signals that the AI trend still has momentum, at least for the firm viewed by many as one of the biggest early winners. Nvidia this year is easily outpacing the broader market and the rest of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap technology stocks. That’s making it a major bright spot as the S&P 500 Index has stalled near record highs amid questions around corporate profits and the timing of anticipated Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts. “From my standpoint, Nvidia is best of breed,” said Shana Sissel, chief executive officer of Banrion Capital Management LLC, adding that it’s dominant in its marketplace, has strong customer relationships and is growing fast. “It’s hard to find a lot of holes in the story.” Read more: Nvidia Is Soaring Again as 3-Day Rally Hits 11%: Tech Watch Nvidia had a better start on a percentage basis last year, to kick off its record rally. To be fair, those gains came after the stock lost half its value in 2022. For the next 12 months, analysts covering Nvidia have an average target price of almost $650, indicating roughly 19% upside for a company that now has a market capitalization greater than $1.3 trillion.  The CES trade show this month solidified confidence for proponents of Nvidia shares. The company announced three new desktop graphics chips that will allow computer users to make better use of AI on personal machines. The shares also got a boost last week when Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress reaffirmed Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang’s assertion that the company expects it can continue to grow through calendar year 2025. “NVDA expressed a tone of confidence regarding end demand and pointed to supply increases each quarter this year,” Piper Sandler & Co. analysts led by Harsh V. Kumar wrote in a note dated Jan. 11, referring to a meeting with management at CES. “To us, this indicates high conviction regarding backlog and order patterns throughout the 2024 calendar period.” Nvidia is expected to release fourth-quarter earnings next month. Analysts project revenue rose some 230% in the period after a roughly 206% jump in the third quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",3
"NVIDIA Reverses Course on Donation Matching for Gaza Charities, Causing Internal Rift",2024-01-24T20:32:09+00:00,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jg545g/nvidia-israel-palestine-charity-giving-causes-rift,"Chipmaker NVIDIA is matching employee donations to charities that support illegal West Bank settlements, settler militias, and the IDF. This became a major issue at the trillion-dollar company involving dozens of employees and senior management, Motherboard has learned, after matching funds destined for charities supporting Palestinians were returned to workers who donated.   On October 7, Hamas launched an attack on Israel that killed at least 1,139 Israelis, and took about 250 people hostage. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang sent several emails in the following days expressing support for the company’s Israeli employees. The company acquired Israeli interconnect solutions company Mellanox in 2020 for $6.9 billion and has 3,300 employees in the country, 400 of which are serving in the military, according to an email viewed by Motherboard. One email said that an employee and his girlfriend had been kidnapped by Hamas. Another said that Mellanox founder Eyal Waldman’s daughter had been killed. The following Friday, Huang sent a company-wide email announcing a special donation initiative. The company would doubly match employee donations in addition to the company’s regular one-to-one matching to approved humanitarian relief organizations through Benevity, a donation and volunteering platform used by other Fortune 500 companies like Starbucks and Visa.  “NVIDIANs, Israel is suffering devastating and unimaginable casualties,” Huang’s email read in part. “Humanitarian relief efforts are underway, but they need our help. We must help. Donate to support the humanitarian efforts. We will stand with you and turn one dollar into three. For every dollar you donate, our company will match with two.”  According to two employees Motherboard spoke to, who requested anonymity due to fear of reprisals, workers were troubled in December when the company retracted this special matching for established non-profits helping Palestinians and returned funds to employees via Benevity, citing “increased corporate risk.” The charities in question include Anera, a reputable NGO founded in 1968 that provides aid to Palestinians in Gaza and rebuilds civilian infrastructure destroyed by bombing, and the UN relief agency UNRWA. NVIDIA’s regular donation matching was also removed from these charities, employees said.  Meanwhile, NVIDIA continued matching donations to U.S. and Israeli groups that are building on West Bank settlements recognized by the UN as illegal under international law, as well as providing material support to the IDF and volunteer settler militias. Motherboard viewed live pages for these organizations on NVIDIA’s charity portal.  “NVIDIA has been supportive of every cause under the sun,” one employee told Motherboard. “We constantly took pride that NVIDIA does not take sides in any of these conflicts. This feels like a betrayal of what we’re accustomed to.”  Employees said that the issue is emblematic of how Big Tech companies, for example Google, have struggled to b...",-3
Juice up your rig with Nvidia’s new 40-series GPUs,2024-01-24T19:50:51+00:00,https://www.polygon.com/deals/24049093/where-to-buy-nvidia-rtx-geforce-4070-4080-ti-super-gpu-graphics-card,"Filed under: Nvidia’s fastest GPUs have arrived, and here’s where you can buy them If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Nvidia’s latest super GPUs have finally hit shelves, bringing more value to the existing 40-series GPU lineup with the RTX 4070 Super and 4070 Ti Super (the RTX 4080 Super is following on Jan. 31). These new GPUs feature increased CUDA cores and clock speeds with the same amount of VRAM and power requirements as before. That said, the gen-to-gen improvements may not be impressive if you’ve been using any of the 2023’s RTX 40-series cards; someone who’s been using an RTX 30-series card or older for the past few years should certainly notice the difference. Before you decide to level up your rig with a shiny, new GPU, its important to check a few things — namely that your power supply can provide enough juice, and that your case can actually accommodate your new card. While the power demands and measurements for each card can vary depending on the particular graphics card, you’ll want a power supply that can provide at least 650 W (700 W for the 4070 Ti Super), and enough space to accommodate a GPU that’s at least 244mm long. If you’ve done all of your homework and you’re ready to upgrade, we’ve listed the price and retailer offering every available model for the RTX 4070 Super and 4070 Ti Super below. We’ll update this page on Jan. 31 following the launch of the 4080 Super with pricing and availability information.

NVIDIA's new graphics driver supports RTX 4070 Ti Super GPU and transforms SDR videos into HDR,2024-01-24T18:13:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/95788/nvidia-new-graphics-driver-supports-rtx-4070-ti-super-gpu-and-transforms-sdr-videos-into-hdr/index.html,"NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready GPU driver that brings in support for the just-released RTX 4070 Ti Super graphics card, and does a lot more besides. Probably the most eye-catching trick here is the introduction of RTX Video HDR, which uses the RTX graphics card's Tensor cores to take video in Standard Dynamic Range and seriously jazz it up with far more vivid colors HDR-style. It also ekes out additional detail that may have been lost thanks to video compression on the likes of YouTube, NVIDIA notes, and you can see RTX Video HDR in action in the video above. How do you get this new ability? First off, install the new driver (version 551.23) and enable Windows HDR features (in System > Display > HDR) - it goes without saying your monitor will need to support HDR, of course. Then in the NVIDIA Control Panel, head to Adjust video image settings, and look under RTX Video Enhancement, where you must enable HDR. Then that's it, you're done - just fire up an SDR video and marvel at the improvement (hopefully). Both RTX Video HDR and the already existing RTX Video Super Resolution - which is DLSS (upscaling) for videos, basically - can be used together to produce some highly souped-up videos (on Chromium-based browsers). NVIDIA's Game Ready driver also brings in an 'auto' setting for RTX Video Super Resolution, to boot. A couple of niggling bugs are resolved, as well, plus we have the usual round of optimizing for various games, namely Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Enshrouded, Tekken 8, and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super: 5 things you need to know,2024-01-24T14:29:04+00:00,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2214232/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-super-5-things-you-need-to-know.html,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. After a generation in the barn, Nvidia is letting its mid-cycle “Super” refresh out to play in 2024. The RTX 4070 Ti Super is an upgrade over the non-Super version that first debuted just over a year ago. It’s the same retail price (though street prices will, of course, vary) with an upgraded processor first seen in the RTX 4080 and a notable bump to a full 16GB of video memory. Cards from Nvidia and its OEM partners go on sale today for $800, so here are the big things you need to know.  Nvidia has a reputation for being overpriced for the last few generations, but the problem really came to a head with the RTX 4070 Ti. Brad Chacos scored it the lowest of any graphics card released last year, bemoaning its $100 price increase over the RTX 3080 from the previous generation. (You read that right: it was a hundred bucks more expensive than the next card up.) This, despite having a more narrow memory bus and less memory than it needed to be competitive for an $800 card aimed at 4K.  The 4070 Ti Super does a lot to address this. The price is the same as the non-Super version, but it comes with the 5-nanometer AD103 GPU seen in the RTX 4080 series, 33 percent more VRAM (16GB) to somewhat address the memory gap with AMD, and a much wider memory bus (256-bit versus 192). On paper, you’re getting a card that’s very, very similar to the original RTX 4080, for $400 less than its original retail price. That’s a good deal, at least in Nvidia terms.  All those improved specs naturally mean better performance…but “performance” means different things in different situations. With a core clock frequency almost identical to the RTX 4070 Ti, the Super variant distinguishes itself with a substantial improvement in CUDA cores (8448 versus the 7680) and the previously addressed expanded video memory and memory bus.  Nvidia Nvidia Nvidia The long and short of it is that while the 4070 Ti Super will see better performance than the 4070 Ti in almost any situation, it will be especially obvious once you start boosting resolution and loading in high-resolution textures. Gaming at 1440p and even full 4K (or super ultrawide resolutions) should see a significant improvement over last year’s card. Again, given that the price is the same at $800, that’s not bad progress.  We’ll have to wait to get the card in the testing rig to see exactly how much better it is than the RTX 4070 Ti, of course. But if you just can’t wait to pull the trigger, we’d definitely recommend the 4070 Ti Super as a suitable upgrade over the new 4070 Super (non-Ti) if you’re looking to game in 4K.  If you use your desktop for more than just gaming, the RTX 4070 Ti Super should be a welcome upgrade for media as well. One of the less obvious upgrades over last year’s card is an extra AV1 encoder. Combined with the boosted CUDA cores, that should translate to a significant boost f...",0

Save $550 on this Lenovo gaming PC with an RTX 4070 today,2024-01-24T13:59:08+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/lenovo-legion-tower-5i-gen-8-gaming-pc-deal-lenovo-january-2024/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site.

This bargain is only available for a limited time though, and once it’s gone, we’re not sure when you’ll get another chance at it, so it’s highly recommended that you proceed with the purchase now if you’re interested in this gaming PC.  Our guide on how to buy a gaming desktop says you should pay the most attention on the graphics card — that won’t be a problem with the eighth-generation Lenovo Legion Tower 5i, as it’s equipped with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card that’s perfect for playing the best PC games at 1440p resolution.

NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs could be 30%-40% faster than Lovelace - but RTX 5090 may hit 60% uplift,2024-01-23T14:21:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/95752/nvidia-blackwell-gpus-could-be-30-40-faster-than-lovelace-but-rtx-5090-may-hit-60-uplift/index.html,"NVIDIA's Blackwell graphics cards should be a considerable step forward, or that's the latest nugget from the GPU grapevine - and we've had some theoretical pricing sketched out, too. As Moore's Law is Dead (MLID) outlines in a new video, NVIDIA will be beefing up its GeForce range considerably with these next-gen graphics cards. What will end up as the RTX 5000 series of GPUs, most likely, should be around a 30% to 60% performance uplift throughout the range compared to Lovelace. The biggest gain will again come from the flagship GPU, as was the case with Lovelace, and the RTX 5090 could be around 50% to 60% faster than the RTX 4090. Then further down the range, we are likely to see 30% to 40% gains for Blackwell graphics cards over their respective predecessors, MLID contends. Add plenty of salt with all this, and especially the next part where MLID discusses pricing, as the leaker is clearly theorizing in this part of the video. (After all, let's face it - RTX 5000 is still a good way out, and NVIDIA itself likely has no remotely firm plans for price tags yet). The pricing guesswork runs that NVIDIA is likely to push up the asking price for the flagship more than any of the other next-gen GPUs. That tracks, as the RTX 5090 carries the biggest (50% plus) uplift, and those kind of enthusiast buyers are not likely to balk at a hefty asking price, such as the $1,800 MLID suggests (up from $1,600 with the 4090). Then down the line we're more likely to see NVIDIA stick more with current pricing, and MLID theorizes about an RTX 5080 pitched at $1,200, which is the same MSRP that the (failed) RTX 4080 launched at. Will PC gamers accept having that price thrown back at them, after the RTX 4080 Super dropped the MSRP to $999? Well, this RTX 5080 could be some 20% faster than the RTX 4090, MLID reminds us, so that could prove persuasive. MLID also sketches out the rest of the range as an RTX 5070 Ti at $800 (equalling the RTX 4090's performance) and an RTX 5070 in line with the frame rates the RTX 4080 Super can provide, costing $600. Take all this with heavy seasoning as mentioned. MLID anticipates the launch of the RTX 5090 perhaps in November 2024, but reckons that NVIDIA could well wait until 2025 before any other Blackwell GPUs are released. Graphics cards further down the range, like the RTX 5060, are likely to provide beefier upgrades than their Lovelace counterparts, MLID speculates, which is good to hear - these are the GPUs most consumers are interested in, after all.

Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti Super review: not very super,2024-01-23T14:00:00+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/24046652/nvidia-rtx-4070-ti-super-review-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test,"By  Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. I had high hopes for the RTX 4070 Ti Super after the RTX 4070 Super impressed me earlier this month. Nvidia’s first RTX 40-series Super card provided some solid performance boosts at both 4K and 1440p — around 15 percent and 17 percent, respectively. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said about the RTX 4070 Ti Super. While the pricing remains the same $799 as the original RTX 4070 Ti it’s replacing, so does the performance. At 1440p on the RTX 4070 Ti Super, I initially found nearly 3 percent better performance over the original RTX 4070 Ti and around 5 percent at 4K. Nvidia had promised 10 percent, so something had clearly gone wrong here. Less than two days before this review was due to go live, Nvidia found a problem with the cards that some reviewers were testing. “We have discovered an issue with the MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER 16G Ventus 3X GPUs where performance was approximately 5 percent below expected figures on other RTX 4070 Ti SUPER SKUs,” said Nvidia spokesperson Lars Weinand.  Nvidia supplied a VBIOS update, noting that performance still wasn’t up to the promised 10 percent figure. “MSI are continuing to work on updates,” according to Nvidia. The VBIOS update hasn’t made a big difference, but after testing an Asus TUF RTX 4070 Ti Super, I’ve found an improvement of around 5 percent performance over the original RTX 4070 Ti at 1440p and around 9 percent at 4K. That’s better than the troubled MSI card but still not good enough. I’m disappointed Nvidia hasn’t returned with a Founders Edition card for this refreshed GPU. Much like the original RTX 4070 Ti, I’ve been testing a third-party card from MSI. Nvidia is leaving it up to its board partners to supply the cards for the RTX 4070 Ti Super, with the design varying per manufacturer. While I appreciate the diversity of choice available with third-party boards, the Founders Edition cards are well-made and sleekly designed.  MSI’s RTX 4070 Ti Super 16G Ventus 3X uses a triple-fan layout with a copper baseplate and heat pipes to cool the heat from the GPU and memory modules. Like other RTX cards, there’s a zero-RPM mode to stop the fans when temperatures are low, so it keeps your PC quiet if you’re not playing games or stressing the GPU. This is a fairly typical layout for the RTX 4070 Ti Super, and most third-party cards seem to be going with the triple-fan design. At the rear, there are also the usual three 1.4 DisplayPorts and a single HDMI 2.1 port.  Overall, it’s still a big card, much like RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 variants, but I’m glad to see 16GB of VRAM instead of the 12GB that shipped on the original RTX 4070 Ti. That’s good news for futureproofing and playing at 4K. Nvidia also hasn’t bumped the power requireme...",-2

Google TVs Now A Billboard For Fast Food Video Ads,2024-02-01T22:36:40+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/google-tvs-now-a-billboard-for-fast-food-video-ads/,"Ads on Google TV are no longer limited to new shows and movies, now showing full-screen video ads for fast food. Last year, Nvidia Shield owners complained about full-screen video ads that were unrelated to movies and TV. More full-screen video ads are now appearing, and users are discovering video ads for fast food. Reportedly, these video ads play automatically, and take up the whole screen for 15 seconds or more. Users can switch away by swiping left or right. There is no way these ads can be disabled, other than installing a different launcher for a customised homescreen.  This move is part of a trend to introduce big, intrusive ads on TVs. Back in November, Amazon announced plans for search ads, and non-entertainment banner ads to be introduced on Fire TV, across boxes, sticks, and TVs. Later that month, users began seeing full-screen video ads on Fire devices. Roku also announced more ads, which include interactive and “shoppable,” will be coming to their homescreens. LG’s webOS and Samsung’s Tizen are turning into ad-supported TV platforms, and almost all major streaming services, excluding Apple TV+, have implemented or announced plans to implement ads. Streaming services do usually allow the removing of ads for an extra fee, however, this option doesn’t exist for TV platforms.   02 9002 5900   [email protected] Level 1, 275 Alfred Street

"Chip race: Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Nvidia battle it out for AI chip supremacy",2024-02-01T20:20:35+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24058186/ai-chips-meta-microsoft-google-nvidia,"Filed under: By  Emilia David, a reporter who covers AI. Prior to joining The Verge, she covered the intersection between technology, finance, and the economy. The rise of generative AI has been powered by Nvidia and its advanced GPUs. As demand far outstrips supply, the H100 has become highly sought after and extremely expensive, making Nvidia a trillion-dollar company for the first time.  It’s also prompting customers, like Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, Amazon, and Google to start working on their own AI processors. Meanwhile, Nvidia and other chip makers like AMD and Intel are now locked in an arms race to release newer, more efficient, and more powerful AI chips.  As demand for generative AI services continues to grow, it’s evident that chips will be the next big battleground for AI supremacy.  Mar 29 Lauren Feiner Reuters reports the list could strengthen the Commerce Department’s existing restrictions on US tech shipments to Chinese chip factories. The US government has voiced national security concerns about letting China access US technology to grow its own capabilities. US companies have complained it’s difficult to know which Chinese factories produce advance chips and are subject to the restrictions, Reuters says. [Reuters] Mar 25 Emilia David CNN gained entry into the training facility where TSMC teaches engineers to design and operate the machines that build semiconductors. The hope is to train engineers to “seed” factories it’s building in the US, Japan, and Germany.  TSMC told CNN that it needs “to hire thousands more” employees to staff facilities around the world as demand for advanced chips grows.  Mar 19 Richard Lawler That’s what this NYT report says a16z and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund are considering, which may explain the rumors that Elon Musk (who denied them), Sam Altman, and others looking to the Middle East to fund their AI dreams. It also recalls last fall’s news that the US government added an “additional licensing requirement” for Nvidia and AMD AI shipments to unspecified Middle Eastern countries.  Mar 18 Sean Hollister Nvidia’s must-have H100 AI chip made it a multitrillion-dollar company, one that may be worth more than Alphabet and Amazon, and competitors have been fighting to catch up. But perhaps Nvidia is about to extend its lead — with the new Blackwell B200 GPU and GB200 “superchip.”  Nvidia says the new B200 GPU offers up to 20 petaflops of FP4 horsepower from its 208 billion transistors. Also, it says, a GB200 that combines two of those GPUs with a single Grace CPU can offer 30 times the performance for LLM inference workloads while also potentially being substantially more efficient. It “reduces cost and energy consumption by up to 25x” over an H100, says Nvidia, though there’s a questionmark around cost — Nvidia’s CEO has suggested each GPU might cost between $30,000 and $40,000.  Mar 6 Emilia David A federal grand jury has indicted a Google engineer, Linwei Ding, aka Leon Ding, for allegedly steali...",3
Best Nvidia Graphics Card 2024: The top GPUs from Team Green,2024-02-01T15:58:11+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-nvidia-graphics-card-4268488,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience. If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. We’ve finally entered the 40-Series generation, adding even more options when considering what’s the best Nvidia graphics card to buy.  With so many specs and mind-boggling features to consider, it can be difficult for many people to figure out which is the best graphics card to buy for their specific use case, whether they want an affordable PC or a super-powerful gaming system.  This is where we come in, as our team of experts will test and review all of the Nvidia graphics cards that we can get our hands on. We use numerous benchmarks (including in-game benchmarks) to gauge the performance, as well as measuring the power consumption and testing features such as DLSS and ray tracing. We’ll be updating this list as soon as we get more Nvidia graphics cards in for testing, with the new Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti, RTX 4060 Ti and RTX 4060 all high on our list.  And if you’re willing to consider graphics cards outside of the Nvidia brand, then check out our Best Graphics Card list for a more expansive round-up.  Every graphics card we review is benchmarked in one of our test rigs using a mix of synthetic tests and in-game checks. We use uniform specs in the benches to help us make direct comparisons between the cards based on the data we collect. We also assess thermals to ensure the cards don’t run too hot, and power consumption, too.  The Nvidia RTX 4090 was one of the very first graphics cards to launch as part of the new RTX 4000 Series. With the cutting-edge Lovelace architecture, Nvidia has been able to boost the performance to all-new heights, while making high-end features such DLSS and ray tracing even more efficient.  In our gaming tests, we found the RTX 4090 capable of playing virtually any modern game with a 4K resolution at 100fps and beyond. The only occasion where this graphics card failed to do so was with Cyberpunk 2077 with ray tracing activated. But the 44fps average score is still an impressive feat, with the RTX 3090 failing to hit 30fps with the same settings.  The Nvidia RTX 4090 isn’t for everyone, with an eye-watering price, high power consumption and large design. Its 4K performance is also overkill, making an RTX 3080 or the new RTX 4080 a better value option for those who don’t have a bank vault to rival Scrooge McDuck. But if you’re craving the most powerful graphics card that Nvidia has to offer, then there’s no doubt that the RTX 4090 is the best graphics card option.  Reviewer: Ryan JonesFull review: Nvidia RTX 4090 review The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super is the darling of the graphics card manufacturers recent slate of new “Super” GPUs, with the RTX 4080 Super focused on fixing its predecessor’s price over boosting performance. The result is a 4K gaming beast. For our review, we took a look at the MSI GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super 16G Ventus 3X and it greatly impressed. Up against the original RTX ...",2
"This Lenovo gaming laptop with RTX 4080, 32GB of RAM is $550 off",2024-02-01T15:04:04+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/lenovo-legion-pro-7i-gen-8-gaming-laptop-deal-lenovo-february-2024/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? When it comes to putting together a gaming setup, you can always build a gaming PC from scratch, but if you’re looking for some savings, there are often deals taking place on gaming PCs with pre-spec’d builds to take advantage of. There are certainly a lot of gaming PC deals taking place right now, and among them are some of the best desktop computer deals we’ve seen. So whether you’re a light gamer or want to find the right piece of equipment for taking on the best PC games, we’ve rounded up what we feel are not only the best PC deals out there, but the best PC deals for certain shoppers. Read onward for more details. If you’re looking for the cheapest gaming PC that’s still a viable gaming PC, then the Lenovo LOQ Tower is an excellent option. It comes with an RTX 3050, which is entry-level but should handle most free-to-play games just fine, as well as older games from the past few years at 60Hz on lower graphical settings. It also comes with a mid-range Intel Core i5-13400F CPU that’s fine for gaming and productivity work, and the 16GB of DDR4 RAM is a surprisingly large amount for this price point and will give you a solid day-to-day experience.  If you’re willing to add a little bit more, then bumping up to the Lenovo Legion Tower 5 nets you an RTX 3060, a solid 1080p card that will be able to handle a lot more games with higher graphical settings and refresh rates. It also gives you access to the latest DLSS 3.0 since you didn’t get that on the previous generations. RAM is in the mid-range at 16GB, but it’s DDR5 Memory, so it’s a bit faster, while the 512Gb should be more than enough to get you started. As for the processor, the AMD Ryzen 7 is a CPU that’s well paired with the RTX 3060 and is fine for other tasks like productivity and general use.  The ROG Compact 10L only has an RTX 4070 graphics card as well as a powerful Intel Core i7 processor, which is a mid-to-high-end CPU that can handle both gaming and streaming at the same time. You’ll still be playing and streaming at 1080p, but it’s a good starter desktop, especially since Twitch and YouTube lock you at lower resolutions and refresh rates when you’re starting out, so you don’t need something powerful. The 16GB should also be more than enough, along with the CPU, to run OBS or other streaming software.  The Lenovo Legion Tower 5i comes with an RTX 4070, a powerful 1440p card that will let you play most games at 100+ fps on reasonably good graphical settings. Also, since it is within the RTX family, you get access to DLSS 3.0, so you could potentially increase the graphics quality of the games it supports. While the RTX 4060 also gives you access to DLSS 3.0, it doesn’t have as much raw power, and the RTX 4080 can be prohibitively expensive, so this is a great middle ground. You also get a powerful Intel Core i7-13700F and 16GB of DDR5 RAM, which is also pretty fast.  If you don’t care as muc...",2

This HP gaming laptop with an RTX 4070 just got a $750 price cut,2024-02-01T12:33:08+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/this-hp-gaming-laptop-with-an-rtx-4070-just-got-a-750-price-cut-deal/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? A few years ago, buying a gaming laptop meant you had to spend thousands of dollars for a big and bulky thing that could barely play most video games for more than an hour. Luckily, that has changed drastically in the past two to three years, and you can now get some really excellent laptops, even at budget prices. That said, gaming laptops do remain expensive compared to non-gaming laptops, especially if you want to play some of the best PC games, which is why we’ve gone out and found our favorite gaming laptop deals for you. We’ve picked several choices at different prices and performance brackets, so you can pick something that fits your needs best, and if you’re not totally convinced and might want something else, you can check out these laptop deals. The Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 is an excellent budget option, and while it won’t be able to play the latest games at max settings, it’s still pretty good. Under the hood it has an RTX 3050, which is an entry-level GPU that will handle most free-to-play games relatively ok with lower graphical settings. It also comes with an AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor, which is a mid-range option and will handle most games just fine, plus will let you get some productivity work done as well. As for the screen, it’s 15.6 inches big and runs at FHD at 120Hz refresh, which won’t massively stress the RTX 3050, which is good.  If you want something with a bit more power and yet still budget-friendly, this Acer Predator Helios Neo is the perfect match, especially since it runs an RTX 4050 under the hood which, again, is an entry-level GPU, but it does give you access to DLSS 3.0. You also get a larger 16-inch screen with a whopping 165Hz refresh rate, although the resolution sits at FHD, which actually isn’t a bad thing considering you’re more likely to hit a higher refresh rate with the lower resolution. Luckily, even for being a budget gaming laptop you get 16GB of DDR5 RAM, so you won’t have trouble running lots of windows an apps, although the 512GB of storage could be a bit bigger in an ideal world.  The Acer Nitro 5 is a good gaming laptop to consider if you’re looking for some value. It has internal hardware that’s hard to find at such a great price, including a 12th-generation Intel processor with eight cores, 16GB of RAM, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card, which is an entry-level GPU. These work together to make your gaming experience immersive and smooth, and a 512GB solid-state drive makes for a lot of space to store your favorite PC games. You also get an impressive 17.3-inch screen that runs at FHD and a 144Hz refresh rate, although the RTX 3050 might struggle with that without graphical setting compromises.  From one of the best laptop brands, the Dell G16 gaming laptop is a tempting proposition. It has a 13th-generation Intel Core i7 processor paired up with 16GB of memory and 1TB of SSD storage.

Dynatrace provides end-to-end observability of AI applications,2024-02-01T12:00:19+00:00,https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/01/dynatrace-ai-observability/,"Dynatrace announced it has extended its analytics and automation platform to provide holistic observability and security for LLMs and generative AI-powered applications.   This enhancement to the Dynatrace platform enables organizations worldwide to embrace generative AI confidently and cost-effectively as part of their focus on increasing innovation, productivity, and revenue. Dynatrace AI Observability is a comprehensive solution. It covers the end-to-end AI stack, including infrastructure, such as Nvidia GPUs, foundational models, such as GPT4, semantic caches and vector databases, such as Weaviate, and orchestration frameworks, such as LangChain. It also supports the major platforms for building, training, and delivering AI models, including Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, Amazon SageMaker, and Google AI Platform. Dynatrace AI Observability leverages the platform’s Davis AI and other core technologies to deliver a precise and complete view of AI-powered applications. As a result, organizations can provide great user experiences while identifying performance bottlenecks and root causes automatically.  Dynatrace AI Observability with Davis AI also helps them comply with privacy and security regulations and governance standards by tracing the origins of the output created by their apps with precision. Additionally, it helps them forecast and control costs by monitoring their consumption of tokens, which are the basic units that generative AI models use to process queries. “Generative and predictive AI will unlock new possibilities for our business with our ML and LLM services, but to implement them successfully, we need to ensure that our services supporting these critical workloads are reliable and perform well,” said Ryan Berry, SVP Engineering & Architecture at OneStream. “That’s why we rely on Dynatrace, a leader in AI and observability. Our teams use Dynatrace to build and optimize generative AI apps that perform well and are cost effective to manage and deploy at scale.” Gartner states, “By 2028, the adoption of AI will culminate in over 50% of cloud compute resources devoted to AI workloads, up from less than 10% in 2023.” This growth partially reflects organizations’ surging interest in generative AI to improve efficiency and productivity, drive automation, and foster innovation. Despite this momentum, many organizations are concerned about costs associated with generative AI-powered services.  These can be many times more expensive than traditional cloud services and are difficult to forecast because they are based on the consumption of generative AI tokens by applications that are not yet in production. Simultaneously, governments worldwide are establishing regulations focused on the use of AI technologies in a responsible and ethical manner and in compliance with applicable laws. Organizations cannot afford to ignore the potential of generative AI. However, they need comprehensive AI observability to help their generative AI investmen...",2

"The RTX-powered Razer Blade 14 laptop is $1,500 off today",2024-01-31T16:19:15+00:00,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2223375/the-rtx-powered-razer-blade-14-is-1500-off-today.html,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Nvidia announced a refreshed version of its Razer Blade 14 laptop at CES 2024, and it’s available for sale today. But if you’re okay with parts that are a little older but still phenomenally powerful, you can grab the 2022 edition of the laptop at a massive discount on Razer’s official store today. Powered by an AMD Ryzen 9 6900HX processor and a beefy RTX 3080 Ti graphics card, this version of the Blade 14 is $1,500 off its retail price, down to $1,999.99.  As is Razer’s typical style, this version of the Blade 14 crams its high-end parts into a sleek and slim a build as possible, with its CNC-milled aluminum body just .66 inches (16.8mmm) thick. This configuration of the laptop comes with 16GB of DDR5-4800MHz memory (which sadly can’t be upgraded) and 1TB of M.2 PCIe 4.0 storage (which can). This model comes with a 14-inch 2560×1440 screen maxing out at a speedy 165 hertz.  Even a generation old, that one-two punch of the Ryzen 9 processor and 16GB of video RAM on the RTX 3080 Ti should be more than enough to run the latest games at high settings on the default QHD, or output to a 4K monitor with the laptop’s full-sized HDMI port. The design also includes double USB-A and USB-C ports with USB 4.0 functionality, which isn’t a given even now.  Razer is probably clearing out older stock with this deep discount, so there’s no telling how long it will last. If you want one, get an order in quickly — Razer will throw in a free messenger bag for your trouble.

10 best graphics cards of 2024: finding the best GPU for gaming,2024-01-31T15:59:42+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/best-graphics-cards/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? Your gaming PC deserves one of the best graphics cards. In 2024, the competitiveness between Nvidia and AMD is hotter than it has ever been, and there are several great options regardless of your budget or performance target. We've reviewed every GPU from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel to bring you a comprehensive list of the best GPUs for gaming. If you're considering an upgrade, make sure to read our guide on how to install a graphics card, as well as some of the most common GPU problems. Why should you buy this: It's much faster than the original model, and it comes in at the same price. Who's it for: Midrange to high-end gamers looking for a GPU that can handle the most demanding games at 1440p. What we thought of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super: The RTX 4070 was already a great graphics card, but Nvidia made it even better with a Super refresh. This new version is between 10% and 15% faster than the base model based on our testing, and it still comes with all of the features that made the original version so impressive. Now, you're getting frame rates at the target resolution that are consistently above 100 fps, and often much more. On top of that the RTX 4070 Super has enough power to press up to 4K, assuming you make a few compromises in the most demanding games. It's the Swiss Army Knife of graphics cards, filling its duty as a gaming workhorse in just about any situation. It comes with Nvidia's excellent DLSS 3.5, as well. It's a huge asset in games like Alan Wake 2 with path tracing turned on, and it can make demanding games more playable at 4K. Between DLSS 3, solid raw performance, and an attainable price, the RTX 4070 Super nails a sweet spot that most graphics cards miss. Why should you buy this: The RTX 4080 Super is expensive, but it feels tailor-made for 4K gaming. Who's it for: 4K gamers who need above 60 fps in the most demanding games. What we thought of the Nvidia RTX 4080 Super: The original RTX 4080 was a bit of a disappointment due to its high price, but the RTX 4080 Super corrects that. Coming in at $200 less, it's the premium 4K gaming graphics card that we've been begging for, and it delivers stable performance across a wide swath of games. Although the RTX 4080 Super isn't quite as powerful as the RTX 4090, features like DLSS 3 help fill in the gap. That makes ray tracing possible at 4K, even at high frame rates. DLSS isn't new, but the addition of frame generation and ray reconstruction on the RTX 4080 Super can massively boost your frame rate in demanding titles. The card is big and bulky, but unlike the RTX 4090, it doesn't require a ton of power. It stays at the same wattage as the previous generation, and in real-world use, it actually consumes about 50W less. For video editing, it's tough to beat the RTX 4080. Although there are better value options for gaming, Nvidia still has a massive lead in video editing, and it accelerated ...",3

This doesn't affect our editorial independence. This gaming laptop deal stood out to me because it comes with a headset and a mouse. I mean, how can you go wrong here? Adorama’s selling the MSI Sword laptop plus a headset and mouse for just $849.99, which is a savings of $449.01. Not only does the MSI Sword have RTX graphics, but it also has a 144Hz refresh rate. That means gameplay should be nice and smooth.  The MSI Sword comes with an Intel Core i5-12450H CPU, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. While I don’t foresee the MSI Sword having any trouble running most modern games on Medium or High graphics settings, I’d recommend scaling visual settings slightly back on more strenuous titles — and flip on DLSS when you’re able. The display is rather spacious at 15.6-inches with a resolution of 1920×1080 and a refresh rate of 144Hz.  I wasn’t able to glean much information about the headset and mouse (like the DPI or number of programmable buttons), but they both have the MSI label on them, making them official MSI products. That said, this is still a really good deal, especially if you’re looking to save money on both a gaming laptop and gaming accessories. Get it now.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super review: The 4K graphics card you want,2024-01-31T14:01:19+00:00,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2222156/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-super-review.html,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Nvidia’s already ferocious RTX 4080 gets a small performance boost and a big price cut for this Super-fied variant. It makes a world of difference. The cheaper GeForce RTX 4080 Super instantly upsets its rivals and becomes the best modern 4K graphics card under $1,000.  Nvidia sure has been fixing the biggest problems in its high-end GeForce RTX 40-series graphics card lineup with the newly announced “Super” series of refreshes. First, the RTX 4070 Super added 15 to 20 percent more performance to better fight AMD’s Radeon RX 7800 XT rival. Then, the RTX 4070 Ti Super upgraded the original’s memory system to better run games at 4K. Better yet, those cards still cost the same as their non-Super predecessors. The biggest problem with the original RTX 4080? Its price. There was no denying its potency, but the 4080 debuted at $1,200, a staggering $500 more than last generation’s RTX 3080 — a 71 percent price increase for a mere 30 percent performance increase. Ick. While the new GeForce RTX 4080 Super indeed offers some small speed increases, Nvidia once again aimed to plug the original’s weak spot. The RTX 4080 Super costs $999, a $200 improvement over the vanilla version (which is being discontinued). Is it enough to make GeForce RTX 4080 Super competitive with AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 XTX, our current pick for the best 4K gaming GPU? Let’s take Nvidia’s own Founders Edition model for a spin and find out. Further reading: The best graphics cards for PC gaming Adam Patrick Murray / IDG Adam Patrick Murray / IDG Adam Patrick Murray / IDG The GeForce RTX 4080 Super still uses the same AD103 graphics die that powered the original 4080, but the full-fat version. The vanilla 4080 disabled two “streaming multiprocessors” full of graphics, ray tracing, and tensor cores; the Super restores those, bringing the CUDA count total from 9,728 in the 4080 to 10,240 in the Super, a modest 5 percent increase. Nvidia also increased the Boost Clock speed from 2.51GHz to 2.55GHz, and nudged the memory clock speed upwards as well. All told, Nvidia says the Super should be roughly 2 to 3 percent faster than the vanilla 4080 on average, and our own benchmark testing backs that up. The real draw here is the price cut — though considering the original RTX 4080 was a beastly performer for play and work alike, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Adam Patrick Murray / IDG Adam Patrick Murray / IDG Adam Patrick Murray / IDG With 16GB of ultra-fast GDDR6X memory across a 256-bit bus, the RTX 4080 Super has no problem blowing through games at high detail settings even at 4K resolution (as you’d hope in a $1,000 graphics card). Impressively, Nvidia managed to eke out the extra performance without increasing the GPU’s power requirements. The GeForce RTX 4080 Super supports all the modern Nvidia features that can push performance even higher, such as DLSS 3.5, ...",3

CableMod’s adapters damaged up to $74K worth of Nvidia GPUs,2024-02-09T17:28:09+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/cablemod-12vhpwr-adapters-recalled/,"CableMod’s adapters were meant to fix the problem of melting connectors on Nvidia’s top GPU, the RTX 4090, but it appears that things didn’t go as planned. The Consumer Product Safety Commission has posted a notice that the CableMod 12VHPWR angled adapters are being recalled due to fire and burn hazards. More than 25,300 adapters are to be returned, and the affected customers are eligible for a full refund. The connectors on the RTX 4090 have been melting ever since the GPU hit the shelves in late 2022, and so far, the only fix seems to lie in careful installation and picking the right PC case that can accommodate this monstrous card. CableMod’s angled adapters showed a lot of promise, at least initially. Seeing as bending the cable can contribute to the overheating, an angled adapter should have been just the fix — but unfortunately, the melting continued, even with the use of CableMod’s solution. In some cases, if the adapter was found to be the culprit, GPU manufacturers directed the unlucky customer to CableMod for refunds. This is because using it voids the warranty. As such, CableMod doesn’t just have to pay for over 25,000 adapters that are eligible for refund, but it’s also had to settle plenty of complaints and fund replacement GPUs for those affected. “The firm has received 272 reports of the adapters becoming loose, overheating, and melting into the GPU, with at least $74,500 in property damage claims in the United States. No injuries have been reported,” said the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The recall covers all CableMod version 1.1 adapters that were purchased between February and December 2023, both on Amazon and directly from CableMod. This includes the 90-degree and 180-degree variants, as well as the reversed adapters. The company will be refunding the entirety of the purchase, including shipping; those who prefer it can choose to get a $60 store credit for non-customized items instead. This is grim news for CableMod, but the company has previously warned customers not to buy its adapters, going as far as to issue a safety recall in December 2023 — so this should come as no surprise. If you’re thinking of buying the GPU for yourself, we recommend avoiding third-party adapters. Installing the RTX 4090 isn’t easy, so you’ll need a case with plenty of space and careful cable management to make sure your $2,000 GPU doesn’t end up on fire. It's no news that the power connector on one of Nvidia's best graphics cards may sometimes melt, and yet, this is still new. Typically, the 12VHPWR connector found in the RTX 4090 would either melt quickly or not at all. Bad news for those who thought they were out of the woods and safe from the problem -- it appears that the RTX 4090 can still melt after a year of usage. Will the saga of RTX 4090 melting connectors never end? It seems not. When the card was initially launched a year ago, the reports of melting cables at the GPU side started cropping up, but then, slowly died down. Now,...",-3
Beyond Nvidia: The hidden stars with 200% earnings growth,2024-02-09T16:36:00+00:00,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/beyond-nvidia-the-hidden-stars-with-200-earnings-growth/," Maintaining an earnings growth rate of 200% or higher isn't something a company does by accident, and only a select few manage to pull it off.  You probably won't be surprised that AI chip powerhouse Nvidia Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA is a member of the exclusive group of companies that can manage to grow earnings by 200% or more. Check out some smaller, less well-known stocks, part of that club: Fluor Corp. NYSE: FLR, Jefferies Financial Group Inc. NYSE: JEF and Golden Entertainment NASDAQ: GDEN.   Triple-digit earnings growth often signals a company's potential for future success. That kind of rapid earnings expansion typically reflects strong demand for the company's products or services, combined with efficient operations and a management team focused on the bottom line.  It also means the company isn't in recovery mode after one or more events, such as supply-chain snarls or high commodity input prices, that put a dent in profitability.  Engineering and construction specialist Fluor should report earnings of $2.62 a share when it delivers 2023 results on February 20.  When it reported third-quarter results in November, Fluor boosted its earnings outlook, saying, ""This revised guidance reflects positive advances on large Energy Solutions projects and continued progress on projects in our legacy portfolio."" The Fluor chart shows a return of 17.03% in the past three months, outpacing its mid-cap index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 ETF Trust NYSEARCA: MDY, as well as the broader market, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust NYSEARCA: SPY. On February 8, Fluor stock broke out of a flat base with a buy point above $40.77, but reversed lower and ended the session at $40.07. The stock is currently actionable.  Shares jumped 4.73% higher on February 7, in volume slightly heavier than normal. That suggests an institutional buyer is accumulating shares, which is always a good sign.  Mid-cap financial services firm Jefferies should grow earnings by 212% this year, to $3.43 a share.  The company is slimming down, selling off investments in various lines of business to bring its focus back to investment banking and asset management. For example, on February 5, the company said it was selling Italian wireless broadband provider OpNet for about $523 million. It previously sold an auto financing unit and a gold and silver mining company.  Looking at the Jefferies earnings history, you'll see a big decline in net income in 2023, so the 2024 forecast is somewhat based on easy comparisons. Still, analysts see revenue growth returning after several quarters in a row of declines. While not as large as other finance stocks, Jefferies Financial may have the advantage of greater agility and growth potential due to its smaller size.  Fellow Wall Street firms tracking the company expect more growth; the Jefferies analyst forecasts show a consensus view of ""buy.""  Amid the glitz and glamour of casino stocks, it's easy to overlook small-cap Golden Entertainment, which ...",3

Get this RTX 4050-powered HP gaming laptop for just $899,2024-02-09T15:47:42+00:00,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2232165/save-400-on-this-rtx-4050-powered-hp-gaming-laptop.html,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking to save some money on a powerful gaming laptop, you’re in luck, as we’ve unearthed a pretty sweet today. HP’s selling the Victus for just $899.99, which is a massive savings of $400. This machine comes with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU as well as a high refresh rate display (144Hz to be exact!). It also has good connectivity options and a keyboard that includes a number pad. What more could you ask for? Let’s get take a peek under the hood, shall we? The HP Victus is rocking an Intel Core i5-13500HX CPU, the aforementioned Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of SSD storage. You should be able to breeze through most games on the Medium or High graphics setting. However, for more demanding titles, I’d recommend scaling the graphics back a notch or two. The 16.1-inch display has a resolution of 1920×1080 and a refresh rate of 144Hz. The maximum brightness is only 250 nits, which isn’t super impressive but it’s not a huge deal-breaker. This is a really solid machine, and getting a gaming laptop for under a grand is always a smoking deal. Get it now before it’s gone.

$1.72 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia has rocketed in value so fast it's about to pass Amazon as the 4th-most valuable U.S. company,2024-02-09T15:20:56+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/02/09/how-valuable-nvidia-amazon-billionaire-jensen-huang/,"Nvidia Corp.’s stock has rallied so much this year that it’s now threatening to overtake Amazon.com Inc. to become the fourth most valuable US company. Having added nearly Tesla Inc.’s entire market capitalization in the past two months alone, Nvidia is worth $1.72 trillion, just shy of Amazon at $1.76 trillion, as of Thursday’s close.  Google-owner Alphabet, the third most valuable US company after Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., isn’t too far away at $1.82 trillion.  The shares are up more than 40% in so far in 2024 amid signs that demand for its chips used in artificial intelligence computing remains strong. But the stock has run so far, so fast that it’s reigniting concerns about whether the gains are sustainable, ahead of Nvidia’s earnings due later this month.  The surge prompted Michael Cuggino, president at Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, to sell some Nvidia shares. “There is so much money chasing it that we thought it was prudent to trim our position a bit,” he said in an interview. “It still has a good future, but it’s too rich.” Its valuation, which spent the second half of 2023 steadily falling as Wall Street’s profit projections ballooned, is now rising again. Nvidia’s price to estimated profits has risen to 33 times, up from 25 times at the start of the year and near its highest level in months. Nvidia is the top-performing component of the Nasdaq 100 Index this year, just as it was over 2023, when shares more than tripled. The stock is by far the biggest outperformer among members of the so-called Magnificent Seven, in large part because it has shown the most significant jump in sales and profits as a result of AI-related demand. It’s not as if Wall Street is losing its conviction in Nvidia’s profit growth. The average of analyst estimates for 2024 adjusted earnings has risen 14% in the past three months to more than $12 a share. The upward revisions simply haven’t kept pace with the stock, which has added about $600 billion in market value over the same span. Nvidia’s multiple is hardly at nosebleed levels. Compared with other megacap tech stocks, it’s in the same league with Microsoft and Amazon and cheaper than Tesla. However, the valuation, coupled with the scale of its rally over the past several quarters, suggests additional gains may be harder to come by.  The stock recently broke above the average analyst price target for the first time since May, suggesting that even Wall Street firms, more than 90% of whom recommend buying the stock, aren’t expecting more upside. The rally also brought Nvidia’s 14-day relative strength index to 80, above the level of 70 that signals to some technical analysts that a stock is overbought. Still, bulls can easily point to fundamentals to justify the advance, including a bullish forecast from Arm Holdings Plc, which soared a record 48% on Thursday. The chip designer’s CEO singled out AI as a long-term driver, saying it “is not in any way, shape, or form a hype cycle.” Nvidia’s last sever...",1

AI to make AI - NVIDIA's ChipNeMo is an AI model created to accelerate chip production,2024-02-09T06:31:02+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96106/ai-to-make-nvidia-chipnemo-is-an-model-created-accelerate-chip-production/index.html,"NVIDIA is arguably the leader in creating GPU hardware for AI, and it shouldn't come as a surprise that it's using AI to accelerate chip design and production. Staying ahead of the game is a part of the picture; NVIDIA is now the world's sixth-largest company thanks to the rise of AI. NVIDIA's custom LLM (Large Language Model) is called ChipNeMo, adapted from Meta's Llama 2, and is trained on the company's vast amounts of architectural data, documentation, and source code. ChipNeMo was first unveiled in late 2023 and is also used as a tool for training engineers via its chatbot functionality. According to Bryan Catanzaro, NVIDIA's vice president of applied deep learning research, designing a new GPU takes close to 1,000 people working together. Access to an AI chatbot with all that data is an invaluable tool. The question now becomes, how much - if any - of the design for upcoming GPUs is being designed by ChipNeMo? According to a new report by Business Insider, NVIDIA hasn't provided any commentary regarding using ChipNeMo for GPU production. If the answer is 'not yet,' it's only a matter of time. AI developing hardware directly or indirectly is now a reality. Google plans to use its new DeepMind AI system to design custom chips, while software companies like Synopsys are launching AI tools to boost productivity amongst engineers. Designing chips for AI is the new arms race. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, AMD, and NVIDIA are all vying to develop and create the most powerful and efficient AI hardware. And there's a tremendous amount of silicon on the table; in 2024 alone, Meta - a single company - is set to stockpile upwards of 600,000 GPUs for AI.

NVIDIA rolls out GeForce Hotfix Driver to fix stuttering issues when browsing and gaming,2024-02-09T04:31:02+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96107/nvidia-rolls-out-geforce-hotfix-driver-to-fix-stuttering-issues-when-browsing-and-gaming/index.html,"If you've been experiencing random stutters when gaming or scrolling through websites, it could be due to an issue with the latest GeForce Game Ready Driver 551.23. This was one of many driver updates from NVIDIA in January 2024, adding support for the new GeForce RTX 4070 Ti SUPER. The good news is that a new GeForce Hotfix Driver Version 551.46 addresses these stuttering issues. NVIDIA's Hotfix driver releases are not part of the official branch; they serve as targeted releases, providing fixes and updates to issues ahead of the next official driver release. NVIDIA considers these sorts of updates as ""beta"" releases, even though they are released as soon as possible to resolve issues. If you aren't experiencing any of the mentioned issues, it's probably not worth downloading and installing. All the fixes in the GeForce Hotfix Driver Version 551.46 release notes will make their way into the next official GeForce Game Ready Driver release. There are four bug fixes in this Hotfix Driver, with the big one related to stuttering when gaming with V-Sync enabled. The wording doesn't mention any specific game, making it sound like the 'micro-stuttering' issues could affect all V-Sync gaming. Here's the list of issues resolved: Some users may experience intermittent micro-stuttering in games when vertical sync is enabled [4445940] Potential stutter may be observed when scrolling in web browsers on certain system configurations [4362307] [Red Dead Redemption 2][Vulkan] Stutter observed on some Advanced Optimus notebooks [4425987] [Immortals of Aveum] Addresses stability issues over extended gameplay [4415277] Head here to download GeForce Hotfix Driver Version 551.46.

"NVIDIA CEO recognized for GPUs and AI revolution, elected to National Academy of Engineering",2024-02-09T01:02:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96102/nvidia-ceo-recognized-for-gpus-and-ai-revolution-elected-to-national-academy-of-engineering/index.html,"NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has been elected to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), which is one of the highest academic distinctions awarded to engineers. The NAE credits NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang ""for or high-powered graphics processing units, fueling the artificial intelligence revolution"". It wasn't too long ago that Jensen won the ""Best CEO of 2023"" by The Economist, but now his ""outstanding contributions"" to the world of engineering were for both the GPU and AI GPU industries. The NAE takes in a bunch of new members each year after they spend multiple months selecting them. There are specific qualities, achievements and contributions that potential NAE members are judged by, with the academy only honoring people who have made outstanding contributions in the following fields: The NAE also publishes a brief description of each of the newly-elected members, with their names, current or most recent vocation, as well as a sentence outlining the achievements that got them elected. The NAE credits NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang ""for or high-powered graphics processing units, fueling the artificial intelligence revolution"". It shouldn't come as a surprise that NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang received this honor, as we have NVIDIA GPUs -- in both GPU and AI GPU form -- powering datacenters, scientists, researchers, enterprises, supercomputers, and more with its silicon. For gamers, its range of GeForce RTX series GPUs are the most popular, most used, and most purchased graphics cards in the world. The NAE had a year-long selection process that ended with a ballot in December, with Huang being just one of the 114 new members, with 21 international members announced earlier this week. The NAE members includes mostly engineers, but as Tom's Hardware points out, there was only one other member for their contributions to computer graphics, with SVP and director of research at IBM Research, Dario Gil. Gil will also be a new NAE member, credited with his contributions in the ""advancement and practical use of artificial intelligence and quantum computing in industry and society"". We have to wait until later this year -- September 29, until Huang and the other new members are officially inducted into the NAE.

Nvidia just fixed a major issue with its GPUs,2024-02-09T00:49:11+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-driver-fixes-stuttering/,"If you’ve been unhappy with the performance of your graphics card lately, you might want to check out Nvidia’s latest beta driver. This is a hotfix driver, which is pretty unusual for Nvidia, but it can be helpful if you’ve been dealing with micro-stuttering, both in games and on the desktop. The update addresses four issues in total, but to get it, you’ll have to dig a little deeper than the standard path of updating your drivers. Nvidia typically bundles bug fixes with its usual Game Ready drivers, as urgent hotfixes tend to be few and far between. However, this time, Nvidia chose not to wait any longer and pushed four updates for its GPU range. The new driver version, 551.46, may fix annoying stuttering issues. According to Nvidia, the hotfix addresses intermittent micro-stuttering in games that occurs when using vertical sync (V-Sync), as well as when scrolling in web browsers “on certain system configuration.” It’s also said to fix a stutter issue in Red Dead Redemption 2 that’s present on some Advanced Optimus notebooks running Vulkan. Lastly, Immortals of Aveum fans should see an improvement during longer gameplay sessions, as Nvidia is said to have axed various stability problems with this update. Nvidia also quietly added support for the freshly released RTX 4080 Super, which was not present in the previous version of the driver this hotfix was based on (551.23). If you normally use GeForce Experience to get new drivers, be mindful that this patch won’t be suggested to you by default. This is because it’s a hotfix driver, which, as Nvidia itself has said, has not been tested as thoroughly as a regular driver update. “To be sure, these hotfix drivers are beta, optional, and provided as is. They are run through a much abbreviated [quality assurance] process. The sole reason they exist is to get fixes out to you more quickly. The safest option is to wait for the next WHQL-certified driver,” said Nvidia. Given the above, if you’re not experiencing the issues outlined by Nvidia, you might as well sit this one out. After the driver’s gone through sufficient testing, it’ll likely appear as a Game Ready patch. If you do want to try it out for yourself now, head on over to Nvidia’s website and download the beta version, but be ready to roll back the GPU driver if anything else goes wrong. In October 2022, when I first reviewed the RTX 4090, I called it ""both a complete waste of money and the most powerful graphics card ever made."" That's even more true now that it was more than a year ago. The AI boom shortly after the launch of the RTX 4090, combined with some international restrictions on the GPU, has caused prices to skyrocket to unattainable places, moving the affordability from unlikely to basically impossible. But that's changing. Reports indicate that prices are slowly dropping, moving from a high of $2,200 down to around $2,000. That's still way above the GPU's list price of $1,600, but the trajectory now is at least positive. The GPU sho...",1

GPU prices and availability (Q1 2024): How much are GPUs today?,2024-02-08T18:16:21+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/gpu-price-tracking/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? The GPU shortage is over, and gamers around the world can breathe a sigh of relief. For those in the market for one of the best graphics cards, we looked closely at graphics card prices and availability to determine where the GPU market is headed and the best time to buy. If you’re looking for a cheap GPU deal, now is the time to buy. Cards from AMD and Nvidia usually hover around the recommended list price, but some models are actually priced well below that, and the same goes for Intel GPUs. Here’s the state of affairs for GPU pricing in the first quarter of 2024. GPU prices have largely returned to normal, and only a select few are selling above the list price. Graphics cards are in stock at retailers, which has cut off scalpers at the knees with inflated prices. The GPU market is in good shape now, with cards on the secondhand market selling for below list price, as they should. Prices have normalized across most popular retailers, meaning these cards are now up for grabs for less than expected, or — at the very least — they’re available at list price. In the past, you’d have to wait weeks for the prices to drop on a new GPU, but the availability often exceeds demand these days. Some new GPUs, namely the Nvidia RTX 40-series Super refresh and AMD RX 7600 XT, have also come out recently. This fills the market with viable and affordable graphics cards, and these releases have already improved the prices of older GPUs. The only current-gen GPU that’s really struggling to stay around list price is the Nvidia RTX 4090. Due to the import restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China, these GPUs have started selling out quickly, and you may have a hard time finding one at a reasonable price. Fortunately, plenty of older graphics cards are in stock, which belong to the RTX 30-series and RDNA 2 lineup. Those GPUs are often budget-friendly, and many make great alternatives to high-end current-gen cards. Nvidia’s RTX 4090 is the cream of the crop when it comes to GPU power (read our RTX 4090 review to see it in action), and it comes with a price to match. The base price is $1,600, and some third-party models are as much as over $2,300. The RTX 4090 has been getting pricier in the last few months, so if you’re hoping to buy one, you’ll most likely have to pay $2,000 or more, and stock levels may vary. Soon after launch, the card was mostly sold out across the board, and unfortunately, that may also be the case these days. You can find RTX 4090s at many retailers, but the prices are much higher than the $1,600 recommended price. However, we still recommend that you head directly to retailers instead of buying secondhand — unless you spot a great (and safe) deal on a gently used card. Nvidia’s RTX 4080 Super is a recent addition to the lineup, and it’s a good one. Although performance-wise it’s practically the same as the RTX 4080 (read our review to fin...",2

How to use Nvidia’s new Chat with RTX AI bot,2024-02-17T16:00:44+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-use-chat-with-rtx/,"Ever since the earth-shattering release of ChatGPT, the computing world has been waiting on a local AI chatbot that can run disconnected from the cloud. Nvidia now has an answer with Chat with RTX, which is a local AI chatbot that allows you to harness an AI model to skim through your offline data. Nvidia RTX 30-series or 40-series GPU At least 100GB of disk space In this guide, we'll show you how to set up and use Chat with RTX. This is just a demo, so expect some bugs as you work with the tool. But hopefully it will open the door to more local AI chatbots and other local AI tools. The first step is to download and configure Chat with RTX, which is actually a bit more complicated than you might expect. All you need to do is run an installer, but the installer is prone to fail, and you'll need to satisfy some minimum system requirements. You need an RTX 40-series or 30-series GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM, along with 16GB of system RAM, 100GB of disk space, and Windows 11. Step 1: Download the Chat with RTX installer from Nvidia's website. This compressed folder is 35GB, so it may take a while to download. Step 2: Once it's finished downloading, right-click the folder and select Extract all. Step 3: In the folder, you'll find a couple files and folders. Choose setup.exe and walk through the installer. Step 4: Before installation begins, the installer will ask where you want to store Chat with RTX. Make sure you have at least 100GB of disk space in the location you select, as Chat with RTX actually downloads the AI models. Step 5: The installer can take upwards of 45 minutes to complete, so don't worry if you see it hanging briefly. It can also slow down your PC, especially while configuring the AI models, so we recommend stepping away for a moment while the installation finishes. Step 6: The installation may fail. If it does, simply rerun the installer, choosing the same location for the data as before. The installer will resume where it left off. Step 7: Once the installer is finished, you'll get a shortcut to Chat with RTX on your desktop and the app will open in a browser window. The big draw to Chat with RTX is that you can use your own data. It uses something called retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG, to flip through documents and give you answers based off of those documents. Instead of answering any question, Chat with RTX is good at answering specific questions about a particular set of data. Nvidia includes some sample data so you can try out the tool, but you need to add your own data to unlock the full potential of Chat with RTX. Step 1: Create a folder where you'll store your dataset. Note the location, as you'll need to point Chat with RTX toward that folder. Currently, Chat with RTX supports .txt, .pdf, and .doc files. Step 2: Open Chat with RTX and select the pen icon in the Dataset section. Step 3: Navigate to the folder where you stored your data and select it. Step 4: In Chat with RTX, select the refresh icon in the Dataset ...",3

Nvidia’s Big Tech rivals put their own AI chips on the table,2024-02-17T13:00:19+00:00,https://www.denverpost.com/2024/02/17/nvidias-big-tech-rivals-put-their-own-ai-chips-on-the-table-2/,"Digital Replica Edition Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts  Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts Digital Replica Edition 
			Trending:		 SAN FRANCISCO — In September, Amazon said it would invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a San Francisco startup working on artificial intelligence. Soon after, an Amazon executive sent a private message to an executive at another company. He said Anthropic had won the deal because it agreed to build its AI using specialized computer chips designed by Amazon. Amazon, he wrote, wanted to create a viable competitor to the chipmaker Nvidia, a key partner and kingmaker in the all-important field of AI. The boom in generative AI over the past year exposed just how dependent big tech companies had become on Nvidia. They cannot build chatbots and other AI systems without a special kind of chip that Nvidia has mastered over the past several years. They have spent billions of dollars on Nvidia’s systems, and the chipmaker has not kept up with the demand. So Amazon and other giants of the industry — including Google, Meta and Microsoft — are building AI chips of their own. With these chips, the tech giants could control their own destiny. They could rein in costs, eliminate chip shortages and eventually sell access to their chips to businesses that use their cloud services. While Nvidia sold 2.5 million chips last year, Google spent $2 billion to $3 billion building about 1 million of its own AI chips, said Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research. Amazon spent $200 million on 100,000 chips last year, he estimated. Microsoft said it had begun testing its first AI chip. But this work is a balancing act between competing with Nvidia while working closely with the chipmaker and its increasingly powerful CEO, Jensen Huang. Huang’s company accounts for more than 70% of AI chip sales, according to research firm Omdia. It supplies an even larger percentage of the systems used in the creation of generative AI. Nvidia’s sales have shot up 206% over the past year, and the company has added about $1 trillion in market value. What is revenue to Nvidia is a cost for the tech giants. Orders from Microsoft and Meta made up about one-fourth of Nvidia’s sales in the past two full quarters, said Gil Luria, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson. Nvidia sells its chips for about $15,000 each, while Google spends an average of just $2,000 to $3,000 on each of its own, according to Ferragu. “When they encountered a vendor that held them over a barrel, they reacted very strongly,” Luria said. Companies constantly court Huang, jockeying to be at the front of the line for his chips. He regularly appears on event stages with their CEOs, and the companies are quick to say they remain committed to their partnerships with Nvidia. They all plan to keep offering its chips alongside their own. While the big tech companies are moving into Nvidia’s business, it is moving into theirs. Last year, Nvidia started its own cloud service where b...",-2

"After Sam Altman, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son joins AI chip race to challenge Nvidia dominance",2024-02-17T08:02:53+00:00,https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/after-sam-altman-softbank-founder-masayoshi-son-joins-ai-chip-race-to-challenge-nvidia-dominance-417918-2024-02-17?utm_source=rssfeed,"Feedback The race for dominance in the realm of generative AI is reaching new heights as SoftBank's Founder and CEO, Masayoshi Son, unveils ambitious plans to raise a staggering $100 billion for his AI venture. This move is seen as a direct challenge to the supremacy of graphics chip giant Nvidia. Reports from Bloomberg suggest that SoftBank intends to inject $30 billion of its own capital into the venture, with an additional $70 billion sought from investment firms in the Middle East. This substantial investment aims to bolster SoftBank's position in the AI sector and could potentially disrupt the market dynamics currently dominated by Nvidia. The proposed AI venture is expected to synergise with the operations of UK chip designer Arm, in which SoftBank holds a commanding 90 per cent stake following its IPO. Recent developments have propelled Arm into the spotlight, with its shares experiencing an uptick following Nvidia's disclosure of a $147.3 million investment in the company, backed by SoftBank. This strategic move underscores the evolving landscape of the tech industry, where major players are vying for supremacy in emerging fields such as AI and chip design. SoftBank's journey with Arm has been eventful, marked by the acquisition of the company for $32 billion in 2016. However, attempts to sell Arm to Nvidia for $40 billion in 2022 were thwarted by regulatory challenges, highlighting the complexities inherent in such high-stakes transactions. Masayoshi Son is not alone in his quest to reshape the future of AI. According to reports from the Wall Street Journal, Sam Altman, Co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, is actively engaging with investors, including the UAE government, to secure funding for a transformative tech initiative aimed at enhancing global chip-building capacity. This ambitious project, which could necessitate raising up to $5 trillion to $7 trillion, underscores the growing demand for cutting-edge technologies to power AI applications. Altman has repeatedly emphasised the need for expanded GPU capabilities to support OpenAI's ambitious objectives in AI research and development. With global chip sales reaching $527 billion last year and projected to surpass $1 trillion annually by 2030, the race to harness the potential of AI is set to intensify.

Business Nvidia, led by its CEO and founder Jensen Huang, briefly overtook Alphabet, the parent company of Google, in terms of stock market capitalisation, reaching $1.83 trillion.
 Ritik Raj Updated : Feb 17, 2024, 10:26 AM IST  Formerly a waiter with big dreams, Jensen Huang, the CEO and founder of Nvidia, is currently among the wealthiest people on the planet and the man behind one of the biggest companies. He began small but has accomplished enormous things in life. The multibillionaire CEO Jensen Huang is currently ranked 23rd on the list of richest people in the world with a net worth of $64.2 billion. The company's market capitalisation recently touched a staggering amount of $1.83 trillion, or more than Rs 15100000 crore. Born in Tainan, Taiwan, in 1963, Jen-Hsun Huang's family first relocated to Thailand when he was five years old. At nine years old, he and his brother were sent to Tacoma, Washington, to live with an uncle. He graduated from Aloha High School, which is located just outside of Portland, after attending Oneida Elementary School in Oneida, Kentucky. Huang was once employed as a server at Denny's restaurant.  Along with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, he co-founded Nvidia in 1993. In 2007, Forbes ranked him as the 61st highest paid CEO in the United States, with his CEO salary of US$24.6 million. Recently, Nvidia achieved a notable feat when it briefly overtook Google parent Alphabet's stock market capitalization on February 14. Acknowledgable as a leader in artificial intelligence (AI), Nvidia briefly seized the title of the third-largest U.S. company. This increase in valuation was driven by robust demand for Nvidia's chips, which are widely used in AI computing. Controversy: Why So Much Hate Towards Hardik?

SHARE OF THE WEEK: Nvidia investors hoping for bumper results,2024-02-16T21:51:11+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/investing/article-13092665/SHARE-WEEK-Nvidia-investors-hoping-bumper-results.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By City & Finance Reporter   Updated:  14:58, 18 February 2024      7 View  comments  Nvidia became the third most valuable company on Wall Street this week, putting it just behind tech behemoths Microsoft and Apple. The US chip maker saw its value more than treble in 2023 as it cashed in on the ongoing demand for Artificial Intelligence. Shares have continued to rise this year and investors will be hoping for more when Nvidia reports its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday.  The bar has been set high after chief executive Jensen Huang said the group expects to post sales of £16billion for the final three months of 2023. This is around £11billion more than the group made in the final three months of 2022. And there is also mounting pressure after the company smashed analysts' forecasts for sales and profits in the first nine months of the year. Some analysts have said this could be to its detriment, with expectations too high. 'The AI hype-train is not only rolling but delivering, as far as Nvidia is concerned,' said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell.  'Momentum investors seem happy to pile in, although value seekers are likely to be more reticent, given the lofty valuation which leaves little room for error.' For much of the past 30 years, Nvidia's success has come from computer games, with its chips featuring in the likes of Call of Duty and Counter-Strike. But its chips are a favourite for AI, which has become the focal point for the biggest players in Silicon Valley. Nvidia has a market cap of £1.4trillion.

NVIDIA RTX 5000 GPUs could be 60% faster - and 2.5x for RT - but may not arrive until Q2 2025,2024-02-16T19:54:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96264/nvidia-rtx-5000-gpus-could-be-60-faster-and-2-5x-for-rt-but-may-not-arrive-until-q2-2025/index.html,"We're witnessing a fairly steady flow of rumors around NVIDIA's RTX 5000 GPUs of late - or whatever Blackwell ends up being called - and the latest batch comes from a YouTube leaker. This is RedGamingTech (RGT) who has been tapping sources to get fresh info on purported specs for Blackwell graphics cards, as well as news on the likely release timeframe. Obviously as with any rumor, take all this with plenty of seasoning, and the caveat that even if these are NVIDIA's current plans being relayed back accurately, the relevant specs and other details may change as Blackwell is further developed. RGT tells us that Blackwell is likely to be capable of hitting faster clock speeds than Lovelace, and that 3GHz is achievable with boost clocks in NVIDIA's next-gen range (though which models will hit that, the leaker doesn't yet know). As we've heard previously, the RTX 5090 will run with 192 SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors), and will have an architectural uplift over and above the Lovelace flagship (naturally). All of this will add up to a generational 60% performance boost in rasterization, comparing GB102 to AD102, we are told. Where NVIDIA is really focusing its efforts, though, is in ray tracing, where we can expect a jaw-dropping performance increase, at least if RGT is right. The YouTuber has heard from sources that the performance target is a 2.5x increase, which is, of course, huge - though note that this is just a target (and a rumored one at that). There may well be some fancy bits of tech involved in achieving that, including Tensor cores having additional functionality of some kind, maybe pertaining to rumored denoising improvements. RGT further asserts that there will be a 2x increase in compute, assuming again that this is the RTX 5090 versus the RTX 4090. This is what NVIDIA is supposedly aiming for performance-wise, anyway, and Team Green is set to employ GDDR7 RAM when it comes to the video memory for Blackwell (and that means even the lower-end next-gen graphics cards). For the full spec details, see the screenshot below. Rumored Blackwell specs (Image Credit: RedGamingTech) On the downside, power usage is going up with Blackwell, and the RTX 5090 could be pitching in at up to 520W, RGT believes (ouch). The overall strategy seems to be that NVIDIA is doubling down on ray tracing, basically, and pushing that line as the future of gaming, furthering that advantage over AMD. Especially when you consider that RDNA 4 isn't going to be particularly strong in ray tracing, even though it will be a generational improvement (of course), or that's the latest rumor. RDNA 5 is where AMD is planning to make its real move to boost RT performance. Finally, RGT imparts the latest gossip on the potential release date for RTX 5000 GPUs. One source is insistent that Blackwell will out this year, but several other sources are pointing to 2025 - and around Q2, not that early in the year. RGT seems to think a launch next year is the most likely prospect, somethi...",2

How OpenAI’s Sam Altman And Nvidia’s Jensen Huang Think A.I. Should Be Regulated,2024-02-16T18:59:43+00:00,https://observer.com/2024/02/nvidia-jensen-huang-openai-sam-altman-ai-regulation/,"At the center of today’s buzzing scene of artificial intelligence are two companies, OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, and Nvidia (NVDA), which supplies the vast majority of computing chips to application developers like OpenAI. While both companies benefit hugely from the A.I. hype, their CEOs are advocates of global governance and setting guardrails in the rapidly advancing technology.

At the World Government Summit in Dubai this week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman proposed a regulatory sandbox approach, which encourages experimentation with A.I. and then “see what makes sense and what doesn’t and then write the regulation around that,” Altman said in an onstage interview with H.E. Omar Al Olama, the UAE Minister for A.I., on Feb. 13. In the past year, OpenAI has become synonymous with the A.I. industry as a whole, as its flagship products ChatGPT, Dall-E and Sora, a text-to-video generator launched yesterday (Feb. 15), have exposed the world to A.I.’s advanced capabilities. Altman said every country is looking to create its own regulatory environment and, at some point, a single global framework would be required to ensure countries are on the same page about the deployment and uses of A.I. An example already in practice is the International Atomic Energy Agency, an organization formed “to decide what will happen with the most powerful of these systems,” Altman said. Altman hinted at the possibility of open-sourcing previous iterations of OpenAI’s models, such as GPT-3, as OpenAI has already done with GPT-2, to foster collaborative innovation. Also speaking at the event was Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, whose company’s market cap exceeded $1 trillion last year. He called on countries to develop what he described as “sovereign A.I.” “This is the beginning of a new industrial revolution,” Huang said in an onstage fireside chat with Minister Al Olama on Feb. 12. “Every country needs to own the production of their intelligence.” Emphasizing the importance of each country owning its data, Huang described, “[your data] codifies your culture, your society’s intelligence, your history. Therefore, you must take your data, refine it, and create your own national intelligence.” The Nvidia CEO emphasized the diverse applications of A.I. across multiple domains, from biology and physics to robotics, highlighting the need for comprehensive regulatory frameworks to ensure safety and ethical standards in A.I.-driven industries. “We have to develop the technology safely, we have to apply the technology safely, and we have to help people use the technology safely,” he said. “Whether it’s the plane that I came in, cars or medicine, all of these indu...",2

The IT sector (up 0.9 per cent) was also stronger, with shares in WiseTech (up 1.4 per cent), Xero (up 2.1 per cent) and data centre operator NEXTDC (up 1 per cent) all increasing.

Why is There a Shortage of Nvidia AI Chips?,2024-02-25T17:56:45+00:00,https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2024/02/why-is-there-a-shortage-of-nvidia-ai-chips.html,"Home » Artificial intelligence » Why is There a Shortage of Nvidia AI Chips? TSMC’s (Taiwan Semiconductor) 2.5D advanced packaging CoWoS (Chip on wafer and wafer on substrate) technology is currently the primary technology used for AI chips. The production capacity of CoWoS packaging technology is a major bottleneck in AI chip output and will stay as a problem for AI chip supply in 2024. Nvidia H100 (AI chips) are built into HGX AI supercomputer systems that weigh 70 pounds and have 35,000 components.  GPUs use utilize higher specifications of HBM (stacked computer memory), which needs the integration of core dies using 2.5D advanced packaging technology. The initial stage of chip stacking in CoWoS packaging, known as Chip on Wafer (CoW), primarily undergoes manufacturing at the fab using a 65-nanometer process. Following this, through-silicon via (TSV) is carried out, and the finalized products are stacked and packaged onto the substrate, known as Wafer on Substrate (WoS). Nvidia is using about 60% of TSMC’s Chip on wafer and wafer on substrate production for its AI GPU chips. TSMC’s CoWoS (Chip on wafer and wafer on substrate) production capacity was about 120,000 units in 2023 and will double to 240,000 units in 2024. TSMC’s monthly CoWoS packaging capacity is expected to increase to 26,000 to 28,000 wafers per month in 2024. Nvidia has started exploring options with its secondary supplier, placing orders with Amkor Technology and United Microelectronics (UMC). The bottleneck within the CoWoS capacity is primarily due to the supply-demand gap in the interposer. TSMC’s 2.5D packaging technology, Chip-on-Wafer-on-Substrate (CoWoS), integrates multiple active silicon dies on a passive silicon interposer. The interposer acts as a communication layer for the active die (logic and memory) on top. The TSV (through-silicon via) process is complex, and expanding capacity requires more high-precision equipment. However, the long lead time for high-precision equipment, coupled with the need for regular cleaning and inspection of existing equipment, has resulted in supply shortages. The high pad count and short trace length requirements of HBM (stacked memory) needs 2.5D technologies like CoWoS to enable a lot of dense, short connections that cannot be done on a PCB or even a package substrate. All HBM systems are currently packaged on CoWoS, and all advanced AI accelerators use HBM. Apart from TSMC’s dominance in the CoWoS advanced packaging market, other Taiwanese companies such as UMC (United Microelectronics), ASE Technology Holding, and Powertek Technology are also gradually entering the CoWoS advanced packaging market. Among them, UMC expressed during an investor conference in late July 2023 that it is accelerating the deployment of silicon interposer technology and capacity to meet customer needs in the 2.5D advanced packaging sector. TSMC and UMC are both based in Hsinchu, Taiwan, but TSMC generates about 7-10X the revenue of UMC (United Microelec...",-2

"Shark Tank India Season 3: From Nvidia, HP jobs to establishing startup to kill mosquitoes; how Eco BioTraps founder turns heads",2024-02-25T05:57:13+00:00,https://www.zeebiz.com/trending/news-shark-tank-india-season-3-judges-names-episode-date-nvidia-hewlett-packard-hp-autodesk-eco-biotraps-prasad-harish-wadke-binal-shah-277863,"Shark Tank India Season 3: Man has reached Moon, produced artificial intelligence, and manufactured finger-nail-sized microchips that assimilate a wealth of global knowledge despite their miniature size. But the century-old problem lingers around about how to get rid of mosquitoes that spread diseases and kill lakhs of people every year. This is what was on the mind of Mumbai-based Prasad Wadke, who used to work on a hefty package with microchip giant Nvidia in Pune, when he visited a restaurant with his friends. Mosquito bites at the restaurant forced him to wonder whether there could be a way to get rid of mosquitoes. And this is how the idea of his startup, Eco BioTraps, originated. The startup that he set up with his friend Binal Shah grabbed the limelight when he presented it in an episode of Shark Tank India Season 3. The idea generated a good level of curiosity among judges who noticed that the startup was working on the root cause of mosquito menace rather than working on temporary methods such as producing repellents that put off mosquitoes temporarily. As a startup, the most challenging task is to prove the worth of your product and make people believe that it is a mass product.  Eco BioTraps chose Asia's largest slum, Dharavi, in Mumbai, to prove the potential of its product. The startup claims to have get rid of the mosquito problem in Dharavi for quite some time. Read the story of the startup that aims to make places mosquito-free. The startup works on a strategy that lays emphasis on the philosophy that rather than fighting a problem that becomes huge, handle it before it originates. It produces pots, which attract female mosquitoes to lay eggs. The pots are kept in indoor places to provide an ideal breeding atmosphere for female mosquitoes, who avoid laying eggs in the sun. The pot is filled with water and has a hole, from which water drains drop by drop. When the entire water is drained out, mosquito eggs get damaged. The 44-year-old founder and CEO Prasad says that in his research, he found that repellants kill or ward off mosquitoes in small quantities compared to mosquito production, which increases by 500–1000 times in one go. He thought it was better to work on the root cause rather than handle the problem in bits and pieces.   Only female mosquitoes bite. Their lifespan is 15–30 days, and one female mosquito can lay 500–1000 eggs at a time. It takes 4–7 days for a mosquito to develop from an egg to an adult. In this way, 500–1000 mosquitoes are produced from one mosquito in one go. The problem starts when these mosquitoes turn into adults, bite humans, and infect them with viruses. Female mosquitoes need protein for reproduction. To fulfil this need, it sucks the blood of humans or animals. A mosquito can suck blood 2-3 times, then goes to nearby water and reproduces. Dengue mosquitoes are more active, as they bite 5–18 people at a time. A dengue mosquito does not lay eggs in one place; it lays a few eggs in many places. Whi...",0

"AMD teases next-gen AI upscaling technology, could use AI in new FSR to combat NVIDIA DLSS",2024-03-04T23:04:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96614/amd-teases-next-gen-ai-upscaling-technology-could-use-in-new-fsr-to-combat-nvidia-dlss/index.html,"AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution was originally released back in 2021, allowing NVIDIA an entire two years on the market as the AI upscaler of choice for GeForce RTX series GPU owners... and now the company looks to be shifting into AI-powered upscaling in the future. In the latest episode of No Priors, AMD CTO Mark Papermaster talked about 2024 being a ""giant year"" for the company, because they've spent many years on their hardware and software capabilities for AI. AI is now spread out across AMD's entire portfolio of products: cloud, edge, PC, and embedded devices and gaming products. Papermaster said: ""We are enabling our gaming devices to upscale using AI and 2024 is a really huge deployment year"". Papermaster didn't specify if this means AI is coming to FSR, but if it did, it would make FSR a much better comparison against NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS upscaling methods. NVIDIA and Intel both use hardware on the GPU for upscaling, while AMD chose the open-source route with FSR which is why FSR works on non-Radeon GPUs. But now that AMD is talking about AI used for upscaling, the tease of FSR getting AI upgrades as we ramp up into RDNA 4 is a little exciting. It also brings around the question of AI upscaling on Sony's next-generation PlayStation 6 console, which according to the latest leaks, AMD won the contract to build the chip for the PS6. Now we have a few years to wait for that, because the beefed-up PlayStation 5 Pro gets released this year. AMD CTO Mark Papermaster said: ""2024 for us is a huge year because we have spent so many years developing hardware and software capabilities for AI. We've just completed AI enabling our entire portfolios so cloud, edge, PCs, our embedded devices, our gaming devices, we're enabling our gaming devices to upscale using AI and 2024 is really a huge deployment year for us so now the bedrock's there, the capabilities are there"".

AMD finally has a strategy to beat Nvidia’s DLSS,2024-03-04T20:01:29+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/amd-may-strike-back-with-fsr/,"AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR 3) has had an uphill climb so far, but things might get better in 2024. According to a statement from the company’s chief technology officer, this year will be a big one for AMD in terms of AI — and this doesn’t just mean large-scale AI, but also upscaling. Are we going to see some major changes in AMD’s next-gen RDNA 4 graphics cards? The tantalizing bit of information comes from Mark Papermaster, AMD CTO, who was a guest on the No Priors Podcast. At the very end of the interview, Papermaster gave a few hints as to what’s on AMD’s agenda for 2024. It’s all about AI, and no surprise — Nvidia has adopted the same approach. “This, for us, is a huge year because we spent so many years developing hardware and software capabilities for AI. We just completed AI-enabling in our entire portfolio, so cloud, edge, PCs, embedded devices, [and] gaming devices. We’re enabling our gaming devices to upscale using AI. And 2024 is really a huge deployment year for us,” said Mark Papermaster. This is a vague teaser, but mentioning gaming devices and upscaling specifically is a strong pointer that AMD may be looking to buff FSR with AI capabilities. While Nvidia’s DLSS 3 and Intel’s XeSS are both hardware-powered and use AI in order to upscale, AMD’s FSR 3 does not. It’s based on a temporal upscaling technique and not supported by hardware solutions. This makes FSR highly accessible — after all, it’s open-source and available on graphics cards from all three vendors — but it may also limit AMD’s capabilities in improving the tech. So far, Nvidia has dominated the upscaling scene. FSR 3 marks a huge step up from the previous generation, but its adoption is progressing at a snail’s pace, meaning that it’s only available in a handful of games right now. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s DLSS 3 is a major selling point in this generation, elevating GPUs like the RTX 4060 or the RTX 4070 Super to much higher levels of performance. Mark Paperman appears to be well aware of AMD’s current position in the AI space, and hints that the company is looking for ways to completely change the narrative. He said: “I think we’re often unknown in the AI space. Everyone knows our competitor, but we not only want to be known in the AI space, but based on the results, based on the capabilities, and the value we provide, we want to be known (over the course of 2024) as the company that really enabled broad AI across that breadth of applications.

Nvidia Leaps Aramco To Be World’s Third Most-Valuable Company,2024-03-04T17:33:17+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/nvidia-leaps-aramco-to-be-world-s-third-most-valuable-company,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has claimed another milestone by overtaking Saudi Aramco in market value, making the chipmaker the world’s third-most valuable public company after Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. The company rises 2.5% on Monday reaching $2.11 trillion, after closing above the $2 trillion mark for the first time on Friday. Meanwhile, Aramco’s value dipped to $2.01 trillion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nvidia shares have skyrocketed on the back of blowout earnings that reaffirmed Wall Street’s optimism on the potential for artificial intelligence to reshape the technology industry. The company dominates the market for graphics chips designed for complex computing tasks needed to power AI applications that companies are rushing to develop. The rally has been relentless this year. The stock has climbed about 70% and added some $883 billion in value.  Meanwhile, Aramco has dropped over 5% this year, with lower production as a result of OPEC+ cuts and a potential follow-on offering by the Saudi government weighing on the shares.  --With assistance from Farah Elbahrawy and Rheaa Rao.

The HP Spectre x360 16 is featured in our roundup of the best 2-in-1 laptops as our recommendation for business purposes, primarily because other options don’t come with a discrete GPU.

The 2-in-1 laptop also comes with Windows 11 Pro, which will let you maximize the capabilities of the operating system, and a 2TB SSD that will provide enough storage space for all of your important files. Categorized by our laptop buying guide as a convertible 2-in-1 laptop, the HP Spectre x360 16 transforms from laptop mode to tablet mode by flipping its keyboard under its 16-inch OLED screen with 2.8K resolution and an up to 120Hz refresh rate. Its display is larger than most of the other 2-in-1 laptops, which makes it a bit harder to use in hand, but the extra screen will come in handy when you’re giving presentations and working on your projects.

Pure Storage and Nvidia Proves AI-Ready Infrastructure Reigns,2024-03-04T14:20:00+00:00,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/pure-storage-and-nvidia-proves-ai-ready-infrastructure-reigns/," Pure Storage Inc. NYSE: PSTG is an enterprise flash data storage solutions provider in the Computer and Technology sector benefitting from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. AI applications require high-powered GPUs currently dominated by Nvidia Co. NASDAQ: NVDA and massive data storage capacity, which Pure Storage offers through its FlashBlade flash array storage systems. The combination of both hardware components is essential for AI-ready infrastructure (AIRI). Pure Storage and Nvidia are already partnered for AIRI built on Nvidia DGX systems utilizing its FlashBlade//S. Pure Storage shares surged 23% to all-time highs on its fiscal Q4 2024 earnings report. Pure Storage has an A-list roster of AI behemoths using its FlashBlade storage solutions, including Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META, Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN, Salesforce Inc. NYSE: CRM, Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL, and Equinix Inc NASDAQ: EQIX. Pure Storage has nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 companies as clients after adding 6 more in fiscal Q4 for a total of 349 companies. In its prior quarter, Pure Storage shares took a 15% haircut when the market mistook the revenue miss as a sign of demand weakness rather than a revenue recognition similar to bookings due to the migration to a subscription model. Rather than posting upfront revenues, a consumption model collects its revenues in a subscription format. It's an accounting measure that's switched over as it transitions enterprise customers from a product-centric model to the  Evergreen//One consumption software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscription pricing model. The switch to a consumption pricing model enables easier onboarding of new customers with low start-up costs that grow as more storage gets consumed. This was also experienced by C3.ai Inc. NYSE: AI in 2023 when they, too, switched over. The market understood this time around that Pure Storage’s fiscal Q4 revenue number indicated a 2.5% YoY drop, but instead focused on its subscription services revenue, which had climbed 24% YoY. Check out the sector heatmap on MarketBeat. Traditional HDDs are still cheaper for a larger capacity than SSDs. Pure Storage competes with HDD makers like Seagate Technology Holdings plc NASDAQ: STX for storage solutions. While FlashBlade systems are quicker with faster read/write speeds, have lower latency, take up less space and use less energy, HDDs provide more bang for the buck with much cheaper costs per terabyte. HDDs are trying to catch up in terms of speed, while SSDs are trying to catch up in terms of capacity and lower prices. Over 90% of cloud data storage is currently using HDD, but AI workloads require high-performance storage, which is a secular tailwind for Pure Storage. Pure Storage reported fiscal Q4 2024 EPS of 50 cents, beating consensus estimates by 6 cents. Revenues fell 2.5% YoY to $789.81 million versus $784.31 million. This was due to the continued migration of enterprise customers to the consumption model. Q4 2024 subscription...",2

Why trust us? You don’t need to spend thousands of dollars to get into PC gaming because there are gaming laptop deals like Best Buy’s offer for the Acer Nitro 5. The starter gaming laptop, which is already relatively affordable at its original price of $950, is currently even cheaper at just $700. You’ll be able to use the $250 in savings on video games and gaming accessories, but you’ll have to act fast if you want it because we’re not sure how much time is remaining before the bargain disappears, and once that happens, we don’t know when you’ll get another chance at it.  The Acer Nitro 5 is equipped with the 12th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti graphics card, and 16GB of RAM. It’s not going to challenge the performance of the top-of-the-line models of the best gaming laptops, but it’s going to be more than enough to play the best PC games.

With sharp visuals due to its Full HD resolution and smooth movements with its 144Hz refresh rate, the 15.6-inch display of the Acer Nitro 5 is an amazing screen for appreciating today’s most popular games. The gaming laptop is ready to start downloading and installing your favorite titles because it ships with Windows 11 Home pre-installed in its 512GB SSD, which will provide enough space for multiple AAA games with all their updates and DLCs. The Acer Nitro 5 is the perfect starter gaming laptop, especially if you can get it for its discounted price of $700 from Best Buy instead of its sticker price of $950.

Nvidia replaces Tesla as investor darling,2024-03-04T06:03:48+00:00,https://mybroadband.co.za/news/business/527345-nvidia-replaces-tesla-as-investor-darling.html,"MyBroadband Nvidia Corp.’s rise is captivating the stock market and driving the S&P 500 Index to new highs. But it also raises cautionary reminders of another investor darling that soared on dreams of a technological transformation, only to tumble back to earth when those hopes turned to disappointment. That stock belongs to Tesla Inc., which sparked its own mania in 2017 as investors bet that electric vehicles were going to take over the world. Back then, Elon Musk’s company was a phenomenon as it blew past established carmakers like General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. in market capitalisation to become America’s biggest auto manufacturer. Some analysts were looking beyond the industry and calling it “the next Apple Inc.” Now, Tesla shares are down more than 50% from their 2021 peak, and other EV stocks that raced higher with it are shadows of their former selves. All of which should be sobering for Nvidia investors who see the stock as a limitless bet on an AI future. The company’s shares have added 66% this year after more than tripling in 2023. “We have seen time and again that when investors fall in love with the idea of the technology innovation du jour, logic takes a back seat” Adam Sarhan, founder and CEO of 50 Park Investments, said in an interview. “And when emotion takes over, sky is the limit.”  There are plenty of differences between Nvidia and Tesla, from the products they make to the personalities of the men that run the companies. But the parallels are striking. Nvidia’s rise from niche chipmaker to one of the biggest companies in the world is based on the premise that its phenomenal sales growth over the past year has staying power. Tesla’s big breakout rally, which occurred in 2020 and put its valuation well over $1.2 trillion, was pinned on the assumption that EVs would be adopted widely and quickly, and that it would be the company to dominate that market. But reality has interrupted that story. Demand for EVs is slowing as the wave of enthusiastic first adopters have already bought, and more price-conscious, change-averse consumers are taking longer than expected to convert to a new technology. As a result, Tesla is down 31% from its recent high last July and is one of the biggest percentage decliners in the Nasdaq 100 Index this year. “There’s all this potential about the driverless car, the cybertruck and the stock is getting hit. Why? They are losing market share and they are losing margins. In the tech world that is the kiss of death,” said Sameer Bhasin, principal at Value Point Capital.  For Nvidia, it’s too early in the hype cycle for any signs of a slowdown. The Santa Clara, California-based company has delivered blow-out results for four consecutive quarters, fueled by what appears to be an insatiable demand for its chips used to train large language models that power AI applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

"Hedge funds call time on tech rally, banks say",2024-03-04T03:16:17+00:00,https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/03/04/hedge-funds-call-time-on-tech-rally-banks-say/,"April 2, 2024 April 2, 2024 April 1, 2024 March 31, 2024 April 2, 2024 March 31, 2024 March 30, 2024 March 29, 2024 March 28, 2024 March 20, 2024 March 8, 2024 March 3, 2024 April 2, 2024 April 2, 2024 April 1, 2024 April 1, 2024 April 2, 2024 April 2, 2024 April 1, 2024 March 29, 2024 March 29, 2024 March 15, 2024 March 15, 2024 March 9, 2024 February 26, 2024 February 24, 2024 Global hedge funds sold tech stocks at their highest pace in almost eight months in the week to Feb. 23, Goldman Sachs said, piling into bets against the sector just as Nvidia’s (NVDA.O) latest earnings fuelled a surge in tech shares. The tech share selling by hedge funds ranked among the highest seen in the last five years, according to the Goldman Sachs note released on Friday and seen by Reuters on Monday. In a separate note, Morgan Stanley said tech was the most net sold sector last week. Stock indexes, including the tech-heavy Nasdaq (.NDX), have rallied to record highs on optimism about artificial intelligence. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA.O) added $277 billion in stock market value on Thursday, Wall Street’s largest one-day gain in history, after the company’s quarterly report beat expectations. But in a sign that sentiment may be turning, the number of hedge funds that now have short bets that tech stock prices will fall is twice versus those with long positions, Goldman Sachs said. Hedge funds took short bets against stocks from tech companies across the sector. They exited long positions and added short punts on manufacturing and service equipment for the semiconductor industry, tech hardware, storage and IT services, the bank said. The speculators added short bets to software companies, Goldman Sachs said, while Morgan Stanley said hedge funds bet against semiconductor and tech hardware companies. However, traders remained reluctant to completely sever their positive positions in tech, a separate note from Goldman Sachs said. That pointed to a two-year high in call options on Nvidia. These are derivatives bets which only make the trader long if the stock passes a certain price threshold – a way to express a positive position in the stock but only if it rises to a certain extent. Speculators were generally short US stocks, piling into the largest net selling of the region’s equity markets in five weeks, the first Goldman Sachs note said. Persistent price rises by US service sector businesses have underscored the stickiness of inflation and pushed back expectations for interest rate cuts in 2024, denting hopes for a soft landing. Traders ditched tech, health care and industrial stocks and instead bought the largest amount consumer staples stocks in 10 weeks, adding companies which make products that people routinely buy, Goldman Sachs said. Morgan Stanley said hedge funds sold equities Monday through Wednesday, but changed their minds after the Thursday tech rally sparked by Nvidia and bought back all of what they previously sold, mainly in industrials, materials and f...",2

Jensen said that that achieving this level of AI intelligence deepnds on how the goal itself is defined. If the definition of this intelligence is to pass human-level tests and exams, then we'll be there within the next half-decade. Jensen said: ""Depending on how you define thinking like a human, the outlook for when the era of AGI will come may vary"". He continued: ""If I gave an AI ... every single test that you can possibly imagine, you make that list of tests and put it in front of the computer science industry, and I'm guessing in five years time, we'll do well on every single one"". AI can pass legal bar examples right now, but it's not so great at specialized medical testing. Jensen said that within 5 years, AI will be capable of passing any and all tests without fail. The bigger struggles will be how scientists describe how human minds work, so how will we know when AI is good enough to think at the power of a human mind, when scientists disagree with how to describe how a human mind works. Jensen added: ""Therefore, it's hard to achieve as an engineer"".

Nvidia bets dominate US options market as AI fervor grows,2024-03-03T05:16:16+00:00,https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/03/03/nvidia-bets-dominate-us-options-market-as-ai-fervor-grows/,"April 2, 2024 April 1, 2024 March 31, 2024 March 31, 2024 April 2, 2024 March 31, 2024 March 30, 2024 March 29, 2024 March 28, 2024 March 20, 2024 March 8, 2024 March 3, 2024 April 2, 2024 April 1, 2024 April 1, 2024 March 31, 2024 April 1, 2024 March 29, 2024 March 29, 2024 March 28, 2024 March 28, 2024 March 15, 2024 March 15, 2024 March 9, 2024 February 26, 2024 February 24, 2024 Investors’ fervor for all things AI-related is leaving its mark on the US options market, as traders pile in to derivatives bets to gain exposure to the red-hot investing theme. Options on artificial-intelligence darling Nvidia (NVDA.O) accounted for 25 cents of every dollar of premium – the price of contracts – traded in US single-stock options over the past month, nearly $3 billion in options premium traded in the chipmaker’s options every day on average, a Reuters analysis of Trade Alert data showed. During several recent sessions, Nvidia surpassed Tesla (TSLA.O) as the option market’s most heavily traded name for the day. Nvidia briefly hit $2 trillion in market value for the first time on Friday – two days after it released quarterly earnings – riding on insatiable demand for its chips which feature prominently in the generative AI craze. Nvidia recently became the third-largest US-listed company as measured in market capitalization. Its shares command a weighting of 4.5 per cent in the S&P 500 (.SPX), giving them an outsized influence on the broader index’s moves. Nvidia’s options should remain popular with traders, “both from a hype and mechanical index perspective,” said Garrett DeSimone, head of quantitative research at OptionMetrics. “It represents such a large portion of S&P 500 weighting.” The stock’s options have drawn a range of bets, including ones guarding against a drop in the stock toward $350 by March and others that would bear fruit if the stock extended its meteoric rise toward $900 and higher in coming months. Nvidia shares were up 1.4 per cent at $798.90 on Monday afternoon. A host of other AI names has also drawn heavy options volume, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI.O) and Arm Holdings . Nvidia’s shares are up about 60 per cent year-to-date, while those of Super Micro Computer have risen 200 per cent and Arm’s have gained 77 per cent. Nvidia is not the first company to captivate options players. Derivatives bets on electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla accounted for around half of all equity, index and ETF options premium in October 2021, as the company’s shares soared. Tesla’s options remain a crowd-puller that still often feature on the list of any given day’s most actively traded options. Though the frantic pace of trading in Nvidia’s options could ease now that its earnings report is in the rearview mirror, market participants said the AI theme was likely to remain popular among investors. Some of the future demand for Nvidia’s options is likely to come from investors who may have missed the wild rally in the stock. “There are undoubtedl...",3

AI rally: Nvidia closes with $2 trillion valuation following Dell&#039;s optimistic forecast,2024-03-02T07:57:54+00:00,https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/ai-rally-nvidia-closes-with-2-trillion-valuation-following-dells-optimistic-forecast-419772-2024-03-02?utm_source=rssfeed,"Feedback Nvidia, the renowned graphics and AI chip manufacturer, achieved a significant milestone on Friday as its stock market value soared beyond $2 trillion for the first time. This historic feat was propelled by a buoyant report from Dell Technologies, igniting a robust rally on Wall Street driven by the promise of artificial intelligence (AI). Following Dell's promising outlook earlier this week, Nvidia's shares surged by 4%. Dell, known for its high-end servers incorporating Nvidia's processors, provided an optimistic forecast, citing a notable increase in orders for its AI-optimised servers. The market responded fervently, with Dell's own shares skyrocketing by as much as 38% to reach a record high, ultimately closing the session with a remarkable 32% gain. The surge in Nvidia's market capitalisation to $2.06 trillion positions the company as the third most valuable entity on Wall Street, trailing behind industry giants Microsoft and Apple, valued at $3.09 trillion and $2.77 trillion, respectively. The ripple effect of this milestone was felt across the tech sector, particularly among chipmakers with exposure to AI technologies. Super Micro Computer, a company also leveraging Nvidia's chips in its servers, witnessed a notable 4.5% surge in its stock value. Moreover, other prominent chipmakers experienced record highs, with Broadcom and Marvell Technology each witnessing an approximate 8% increase, while Advanced Micro Devices climbed over 5%. The PHLX chip index surged by 4.3% to establish its own record high, bolstering its 2024 gain to an impressive 18%. Nvidia's dominance in the high-end AI chip market, with a commanding 80% share, underscores its pivotal role in driving innovation across various industries. Notable clients such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms have been swiftly acquiring Nvidia's components to stay competitive in the burgeoning generative AI sector. The surge in Nvidia's market activity has solidified its position as Wall Street's most traded stock by value, surpassing the likes of Tesla. Investors have exchanged an average of $36 billion worth of Nvidia's stock over the past 30 sessions, compared to $21 billion for Tesla. On Friday alone, trading in Nvidia reached a staggering $38 billion worth of shares. Nvidia's meteoric rise in 2024, with a 66% increase in its stock value, follows a remarkable performance in the preceding year, where its value more than tripled. Last month, Nvidia's market capitalisation surpassed tech behemoths Amazon and Alphabet, reflecting its relentless growth trajectory. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

Market growth driven by the few,2024-03-02T05:25:24+00:00,https://scotscoop.com/market-growth-driven-by-the-few/,"On Feb. 23, Nvidia achieved a market cap of $2 trillion. This achievement was important for other companies as well. Nvidia’s growth was responsible for 28% of all the gains of the Standard and Poor’s 500, or the S&P 500, an index encompassing about 80% of the capital in all public American companies. Combined with Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon, the four companies have been responsible for 60% of the S&P 500’s gains. Nvidia’s growth In 2024, Nvidia’s stock price already increased by 59%, making it the third most valuable company in the U.S. Nvidia’s growth continued the trend last year when it tripled its value in one year. Capitalizing on the surge in artificial intelligence (AI), Nvidia’s business of selling graphics processing units, which are critical to powering AI, allowed it to rapidly grow to become the juggernaut it is today. Impact on the S& The growth of larger companies in the S&P 500 has a larger effect on the total price. This leads to the growth that the S&P 500 sees today — just seven stocks make up 30% of the weighting in the S&P 500, and they are responsible for much of the growth of the index as well. These seven stocks have been some of the best performers in the stock market. If the S&P 500 were not weighted, so that all of the 500 companies had an equal effect on the price, the index would have grown 51% less over the past 15 years. These seven companies have grown by varying amounts this year. (Source: Barron’s stock overview (real-time market data) as of 2/29/24) If the market is to continue to grow, it will rely primarily on the few strong performers.  “We are at a historic extreme in the amount of money in this very small number of stocks,” said Michael Smith, a senior portfolio manager, earlier this month.

Nvidia CEO says AI could pass human tests in five years,2024-03-02T05:10:26+00:00,https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-could-pass-human-tests-in-five-years-419754-2024-03-02?utm_source=rssfeed,"Feedback  Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang on Friday said that artificial general intelligence could - by some definitions - arrive in as little as five years. Huang, who heads the world's leading maker of artificial intelligence chips used to create systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT, was responding to a question at an economic forum held at Stanford University about how long it would take to achieve one of Silicon Valley's long-held goals of creating computers that can think like humans. Huang said that the answer largely depends on how the goal is defined. If the definition is the ability to pass human tests, Huang said, artificial general intelligence (AGI) will arrive soon. ""If I gave an AI ... every single test that you can possibly imagine, you make that list of tests and put it in front of the computer science industry, and I'm guessing in five years time, we'll do well on every single one,"" said Huang, whose firm hit $2 trillion in market value on Friday. As of now, AI can pass tests such as legal bar exams, but still struggles on specialized medial tests such as gastroenterology. But Huang said that in five years it should also be able to pass any of them. But by other definitions, Huang said, AGI may be much further away, because scientists still disagree on how to describe how human minds work. ""Therefore, it's hard to achieve as an engineer"" because engineers need defined goals, Huang said. Huang also addressed a question about how many more chip factories, called ""fabs"" in the industry, are needed to support the expansion of the AI industry. Media reports have said OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman thinks many more fabs are needed. Huang said that more will be needed, but each chip will also get better over time, which acts to limit the number of chips needed. ""We're going to need more fabs. However, remember that we're also improving the algorithms and the processing of (AI) tremendously over time,"" Huang said. ""It's not as if the efficiency of computing is what it is today, and therefore the demand is this much. I'm improving computing by a million times over 10 years.""

"US share market Friday March 1 session: S&P 500, Nasdaq hit fresh records on AI boost; Nvidia mcap tops 2 trillion dollars at close",2024-03-02T02:08:24+00:00,https://www.zeebiz.com/markets/global-markets/news-us-share-market-friday-march-1-session-sp-500-nasdaq-hit-fresh-records-on-ai-boost-nvidia-mcap-tops-2-trillion-dollars-at-close-278732,"US stocks rose on Friday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closing at record highs, as technology stocks rallied on continued enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, with further support from declining Treasury yields. The gains marked the second straight closing record for the Nasdaq, which also set an intraday record as AI-related names such as Nvidia and Meta Platforms led it past its prior peak of 16,212.23 set in November 2021. Through the end of February, the three major indexes notched their fourth straight month of gains in a rally largely fueled by growth prospects related to AI, which has also lifted semiconductor names. On Friday, shares of Nvidia climbed 4 per cent and closed above $2 trillion in market value for the first time. Rival Advanced Micro Devices shares gained 5.25 per cent to a record high close of $202.64, while the broader Philadelphia semiconductor index also closed at a record after a jump of 4.29 per cent on the session. Markets have drawn support from a resilient economy, as investors have tried to gauge the timing of the first interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, with investors currently targeting June and growing expectations the central bank can engineer a soft landing for the economy. ""Because the economy is doing well and because inflation remains a bit sticky, the Fed will be slower to lower interest rates,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. ""But that's good because then we're gradually coming off of the higher interest rate cycle and we're not in need of cutting rates aggressively."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 90.99 points, or 0.23 per cent , to 39,087.38, the S&P 500 gained 40.81 points, or 0.80 per cent, to 5,137.08 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 183.02 points, or 1.14 per cent, to 16,274.94. For the week, the S&P 500 gained 0.95 per cent, the Nasdaq rose 1.74 per cent, and the Dow fell 0.11 per cent. Despite a strong services sector and tight labor market, the economy still shows pockets of weakness, notably in manufacturing, although data on Friday included some signs of a possible rebound. That helped push U.S. Treasury yields lower, with the two-year note yield falling to as low as 4.519 per cent. Fed Governor Chris Waller said upcoming decisions about the ultimate size of its balance sheet have no bearing on its inflation fight. Fellow Fed Governor Adriana Kugler said she is cautiously optimistic progress will continue on disinflation without a significant weakening of the labor market, and that the central bank has avoided a wage-price spiral. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said it is too soon to predict when the Fed will be able to begin cutting rates. The S&P 500 tech index was the top performer of the 11 major sectors, gaining 1.78 per cent, while utilities were weakest, showing a decline of 0.72 per cent. Among major movers, New York Community Bancorp tumbled 25.89 per cent after the regional lender said it had found ""material weaknesses"" i...",3

Nvidia is reportedly ‘worried that it’s missing the boat’,2024-03-01T18:39:28+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-may-soon-make-gaming-handhelds/,"Nvidia and AMD trade blows when it comes to making some of the best graphics cards, but there’s one area where AMD obliterates Nvidia: gaming handhelds. The booming market of portable gaming PCs largely belongs to AMD right now. However, that might soon change, as it seems that Nvidia is gearing up to ensure that its chips power next-gen handhelds — but there are a few obstacles to consider before such a device can ever be made. AMD really went all-in on gaming handhelds at just the right time. From the Steam Deck to the Asus ROG Ally, the portable PCs that bridge the gap between a computer and a console are all the rage right now, and they’re almost exclusively powered by AMD APUs. There are a couple of Intel Core Ultra-based handhelds on the way, such as the MSI Claw, but so far, AMD dominates. Nvidia is completely absent, and it’s safe to say it’s missing out on a huge opportunity. According to Moore’s Law Is Dead, Nvidia recognizes it’s time to change the current narrative. The YouTuber said: “Nvidia is not happy with the fact that AMD has a successful Steam Deck out there, [it] might also have a new PlayStation handheld powered by AMD. At the same time, there are things like the ROG Ally, and really dozens of other handheld gaming Windows devices, all powered by AMD.” With this many gaming handhelds all running on an AMD chip, it almost seemed like Nvidia just wasn’t interested in catering to that part of the market, but Moore’s Law Is Dead disagrees, saying, “Nvidia is worried that it’s missing the boat here.” The problem with Nvidia potentially contributing to a gaming handheld is that it can’t do it all on its own. AMD and Intel make their own processors with built-in graphics, but Nvidia doesn’t manufacture x86 CPUs, and obviously, a GPU alone won’t cut it. That leaves Nvidia in a tricky position where it needs not just one partner (such as Asus or MSI to manufacture the device), but two, because another company needs to supply the processor. Although Intel recently put its rivalry with AMD to rest, it’s hard to imagine AMD and Nvidia teaming up to work on a gaming handheld together. Instead, Moore’s Law Is Dead speculates that we might see Nvidia partner up with Intel to make a premium gaming handheld. “Premium” is certainly the right word to use here because it’s easy to imagine that it’d outperform every other similar device by a landslide. The handheld would have a dedicated GPU as well as a CPU, meaning that the battery life might take a hit, and the console might need one beefy heatsink, but it’d be a powerful mini computer. Even if the rumor turns out to be true and Nvidia does, one day, make a move on the gaming handheld market, it’s not going to happen anytime soon — Moore’s Law Is Dead made it clear that this is something that might happen years from now. For the time being, AMD has nothing to worry about. Nvidia's RTX 4070 is one of the best graphics cards you can buy, make no mistake about that. Some recent price drops, combi...",1

"Riding high on AI, Nvidia is no bubble, says Wall Street",2024-03-01T16:42:00+00:00,https://timesofmalta.com/article/riding-high-ai-nvidia-no-bubble-says-wall-street.1087144,"The emergence of AI bots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard has fueled a massive rise in share prices of chip-making juggernaut Nvidia, with its skyrocketing stock now making it the world's fourth biggest company by market capitalization. And for Wall Street, it's no bubble. Between the launch of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, for example, and the market close on February 23, Nvidia's share price increased fivefold, lifted to investor heaven by an insatiable hunger for so-called generative artificial intelligence. That day Nvidia also crossed the symbolic valuation of $2 trillion, a threshold only reached by Microsoft, Apple and oil giant Saudi Aramco. The journey has been nothing but mind-boggling for a company that doesn't even rank among the world's top 150 firms in terms of sales, and barely in the top 1,000 in terms of employees. On paper, this hot streak is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble, which saw the share price of fiber networking giant Cisco rise eightfold in 18 months, to the point of becoming, for a few minutes, the world's most valuable company in terms of market capitalization in March 2000, before the tech bubble burst. ""In AI, there might be some names out there that might be getting a bit ahead of their skis from a valuation perspective, and those stories are going to work themselves out over time,"" CFRA analyst Angelo Zino told AFP. ""But on the Nvidia side of things, it's more fundamentally driven,"" he said, without the ""type of hype you had previously."" Unlike the frothy days before the bubble popped in 2000, Nvidia's actual annual net income (up an eye-popping 581% year-on-year) is on par with the stock price, said Larry Tentarelli of Blue Chip Daily Trend Report, a research firm.  For analysts at Wedbush Securities, the relevant parallel is not with 2000 and the end of the dot-com bubble, but rather with 1995, when the dot-com boom began. Despite appearances, Nvidia's success is not out of the blue, but rather years in the making. At the root of this 30-year-old company's success are graphics processors or graphics cards, known as GPUs (graphics processing units) - chips with far greater computing capacity than conventional microprocessors (CPUs). Initially developed to improve the graphics quality of video games, the company run by Jensen Huang figured out the technology was perfectly suited for developing the large language models (LLMs) that underpin generative AI interfaces such as ChatGPT. Despite initial skepticism from Wall Street, Nvidia went down that road, years before programs like ChatGPT exploded onto the scene. Now Nvidia's rivals have set off in pursuit, and several of them, notably AMD and Intel, are already marketing their own AI-oriented GPUs, while Apple, Microsoft and Amazon have also developed chips with AI in mind. But Nvidia ""is years ahead"" of its competitors, explained Tentarelli. ""The only real risk for Nvidia is if for some reason they run into some unexpected delay... if they can't produce e...",1

Abercrombie stock surged past Nvidia in 2023. It just had its worst week in years as the retailer banks on continued millennial interest,2024-03-12T20:45:33+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/03/12/abercrombie-stock-nvidia-earnings-gen-z-millennials/,"Abercrombie & Fitch is “no longer a jeans and T-shirt brand,” CEO Fran Horowitz boasted on Wednesday’s fourth-quarter earnings call. The apparel retailer soared on a 21% increase in 2023 sales of $1.45 billion—up from $1.2 billion the year before—but tepid sales growth predictions for 2024 have halted its skyrocketing stock. Following the earnings report, shares fell 9.7% in Abercrombie’s worst week since August 2022. The retailer expects net sales growth from 4% to 6% for fiscal 2024, in line with estimates but lower than last year. Concerns over Abercrombie’s ability to sustain revenue growth have caused shares to sink, Bloomberg reported.  Morgan Stanley analyst Alex Straton said in a March 7 note that Abercrombie’s profitability expectations could be too optimistic. Fashion brands, which rely on cyclical seasons and trends, are vulnerable to missteps, should they miss the mark on product rollout.  “The risk-reward skews to the downside from current levels… We caution current growth and profitability levels could be difficult to maintain heading into [the second half of the year],” she said. Abercrombie reached high highs in 2023, with its performance landing it at the top of the S&P 1500 Index. In 2023, it gained 285%, higher than AI darling Nvidia’s 239% surge, and has gained closer to 400% over the past 12 months. The retailer owes its sales success to revamping its inventory to appeal to younger shoppers, as well as customers who don’t mind inflation-induced higher prices. Horowitz said the company intends to continue to lean on its expanding audience of both older Gen Zers and young millennials for future growth. “The addressable market has gone from customers in their early twenties to late thirties, and we’ve broadened all the offerings from a category perspective,” Horowitz said. Abercrombie has launched both special occasion, casual, and activewear lines to dress young people for their weekend endeavors. Young generations have a strong interest in clothing with 87% of Gen Z, as well as 82% of millennials, planning to buy fashion items over the next six months, according to a February UNiDays survey of over 5,000 UK students. While Gen Z is cost-conscious and thrifty, they also don’t mind splurging a little extra on luxury goods. Gen Z and millennials are the generations most likely to make splurge purchases, including pricier fashion items. A June 2023 Harris Poll of over 2000 U.S. adults found that 75% of Gen Z and 68% of millennials made splurge purchases last year. But even young fashion enthusiasts may not be able to reverse the trends of uncertainty in the fashion industry. McKinsey & Company’s State of Fashion 2024 report predicts a 2% to 4% “slower but normalized” growth in the industry as a result of inflation and lack of consumer confidence. The Bureau of Labor Statistics noted a 0.6% uptick this month in CPI for urban consumers in apparel. The fashion industry may have an uncertain future, but Abercrombie has built back from...",0
How Nvidia’s billionaire CEO went from Denny’s dishwasher to leading a company with a $2 trillion market cap,2024-03-12T18:42:24+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/03/12/billionaire-nvidia-ceo-first-job-dennys/,"Jensen Huang was once Denny’s “best dishwasher.” “I planned my work. I was organized. I was mise en place,” Huang said during a recent interview with Stanford Graduate School of Business. “I washed the living daylights out of those dishes.” Now he’s beating the living daylights out of the competition as president and CEO of Nvidia, the world’s premiere advanced chip manufacturer. He’s now worth nearly $82 billion, and the company he cofounded has a $2 trillion market cap.  But Huang attributes his wild success in business to the work ethic he picked up during his time with Denny’s as a dishwasher, before he was “promoted” to busboy. “I never left the station empty-handed. I never came back empty-handed. I was very efficient,” Huang said. “Anyways, eventually I became a CEO. I’m still working on being a good CEO.” Huang was born in Taiwan in 1963, moved to Thailand at age 5, and moved to Washington State in the U.S. when he was 9. He went to high school outside of Portland, Ore., where he started working for Denny’s at age 15, according to an Nvidia blog post. Huang then earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University, then went on to get his master’s in the same subject from Stanford University in 1992.  Not only did Huang land his first job at Denny’s—but it’s also the place where he and two of his friends cooked up the idea that would make him a billionaire. In 1993, Huang, along with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem (who both worked at Sun Microsystems), met at what was one of Denny’s “most popular” locations in Northern California to discuss “creating a chip that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers,” according to the Nvidia blog post.  “Chris and Curtis said one day they’d like to leave [Sun Microsystems], and they’d like me to go figure out what they’re going to leave for,” Huang said. “They insisted I figure out with them how to build a company.” But with little runway on how to build a business, Huang said he resolved to visit a bookstore to find books on starting a business and found one titled How to Write a Business Plan by Gordon Bell. But the issue was the book was 450 pages long. “Well, I never got through it. And not even close,” Huang said. “I flipped through a few pages and I go, ‘You know what, by the time I’m done reading this thing, I’ll be out of business.” So with that, Huang took to a Denny’s booth with his two friends to brainstorm a business. At the time, Huang was working as an engineer with LSI Logic, a company in Santa Clara, Calif., that sold semiconductors and software. Avago Technologies acquired LSI Logic for $6.6 billion in 2014. But Huang kind of skips over that part when he’s telling his career story.  “My first job before CEO was a dishwasher,” Huang said in the Stanford interview. “And I did that very well.” While at Denny’s that fateful night, Huang, Malachowsky, and Priem “polished off a Lumberjack Slam, Moons Over My Hammy, and a Super Bird sandwich—washed down wi...",0
Nvidia Leads Semiconductor Stock Rebound After Two-Day Selloff,2024-03-12T18:30:35+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/nvidia-leads-semiconductor-stock-rebound-after-two-day-selloff,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. led chipmaker stocks higher on Tuesday after a semiconductor index suffered its worst two-day loss in more than two months. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index rose as much as 1.8% on Tuesday, recouping a portion of the 5.3% loss from the selloff seen Monday and Friday. Nvidia was the biggest gainer with an advance of as much as 6.3%, followed by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which rose as much as 5.5%. Semiconductor stocks have soared this year amid excitement about demand for components used in artificial intelligence computing. The Philadelphia chip index has gained about 19% since the start of the year — more than twice the gains for the Nasdaq 100 Stock Index and the S&P 500. Tuesday’s rally has pushed Nvidia back within reach of its March 7 closing record of $926.69. The chipmaker has gained more than 80% this year after more than tripling in 2023.   More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",3
Watch us try out the awesome new Nvidia App,2024-03-12T15:41:06+00:00,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2263614/pcworld-goes-hands-on-with-the-new-nvidia-app.html,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Last month Nvidia released a beta version of a new self-titled app, intended to completely replace GeForce Experience and incorporate at least some of the features of the long-running Nvidia Control Panel. PCWorld’s Will Smith goes hands-on with the new Nvidia App in our latest YouTube video.  Will, and no doubt a few other Nvidia users, appreciate that you don’t need to log into this app in order to access its features, which is more than you can say for GeForce Experience. But it’s also pretty decent on its own. The homescreen includes your most often-played games and a selection of links to relevant Nvidia services like GeForce Now and Nvidia Broadcast, though these remain discrete programs.  The Drivers page is probably where a lot of people will find the most utility. Like GeForce Experience, this is an integrated system. But the new version gives some great, easy-to-read info on the latest patch notes. This at-a-glance presentation is great for people who want to know why they should update. The new Graphics page is especially user-friendly. While you can manually adjust most of the major settings within the high-end games, a simple optimization slider lets you change all of the broad settings, going from performance to quality with a single slider. It’s a great presentation if you’d rather not dive into the deep end of modern visuals. The Settings page gives you info on your GPU and Windows version.  The custom performance overlay on 3D games is especially handy. While it’s missing a 1% FPS value (which is relevant if you’re aiming for maximum stability), the option to add info like GPU clock and temperature is appreciated. The overlay app can record clips and screenshots just like it used to, though the option to stream to Twitch and YouTube is gone, presumably because few users were actually taking advantage of it.  The Nvidia App still can’t replicate all the functions of Nvidia Control Panel, which remains the place to find advanced settings like G-Sync or Nvidia Surround. But for the vast majority of users, it looks like a marked improvement over the fractured status quo.

Active Rebound: 2 Discrete Semiconductor Stocks Making Moves,2024-03-12T12:00:00+00:00,https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/active-rebound-2-discrete-semiconductor-stocks-making-moves/," Semiconductor stocks are surging thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom driven by Nvidia Co. NASDAQ: NVDA and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF is up 28.66% year-to-date (YTD). It’s tough to find a group of semiconductors in the computer and technology sector that are still considered conservatively cheap unless they are severely underperforming or are frankly boring. Remember that most people assume semiconductors are all computer chips, considered integrated circuits (ICs) or microchips containing multiple electronic components that include capacitors, transistors and resistors integrated into a single silicon wafer. Discrete semiconductors are individual electronic components that perform specific electronic functions like controlling and amplifying electric currents or voltages and switching circuits. Passive electronic components don't require a power source and don’t amplify or control electronic signals but instead store, filter or regulate electrical energy like capacitors and resistors. Here are 2 discrete semiconductor stocks that are both underperforming and a tad boring but may be coming to the bottom of their normalization cycles.  Vishay Intertechnology Inc. NYSE: VSH happens to have one of the world's largest semiconductor portfolios, supplying electronic components to various end markets from industrial to automotive sectors. Their semiconductors include metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) used for switching and amplifying electronic signals, diodes, and optoelectronic components. They also have inductors and capacitors as passive electronic components that manage electrical energy flows. Their components are used in 5G and internet-of-things (IoT) networks. Their network of original electronics manufacturer (OEM) customers reads like a who’s who of technology, automotive, healthcare, consumer electronics, to industrial, including companies like Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL, Tesla Inc. NASDAQ: TSLA, Sony Co. NYSE: SNE, Medtronic plc NYSE: MDT and Honeywell International Inc. NASDAQ: HON. On Feb. 7, 2024, Vishay reported an EPS of 37 cents, beating consensus estimates of 36 cents by a penny. Revenues fell 8.2% YoY to $785.24 million versus $787.15 million. The book-to-bill ratio was 0.75, with the end of the quarter backlog of 5.3 months. The company expected Q1 2024 revenues between $715 million to $755 million versus $795.1 million.

"Limited Appetite Ahead of US CPI, Bitcoin at Record",2024-03-12T07:09:56+00:00,https://www.actionforex.com/contributors/fundamental-analysis/543407-limited-appetite-ahead-of-us-cpi-bitcoin-at-record/,"The week started with limited appetite in US stock and a fresh record for Bitcoin. Major US indices were flat on Monday’s trading session. The S&P 500 slid 0.11% as sentiment in technology stocks was mixed. Nvidia tumbled 2% yesterday, but Google gained nearly 2%. The US dollar recovered the post-US jobs data losses, the US 2-year yield stabilized near a touch above the 4.50% level and the 10-year near the 4% mark ahead of today’s all-important US CPI data. Investors are not feeling fully comfortable into today’s US inflation print, as there are several factors warning of a second blip in US disinflation that could eventually lead to a further softening in dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) expectations. One of them is the jump in gasoline prices in February, another is the change in CPI calculation and the third is the rising inflation expectations. Released yesterday, New York Fed’s survey showed a steep rise in 3 and 5-year inflation expectations, and a steady expectation of around 3% for this year. That means that consumers who have been surveyed by New York Fed don’t expect inflation to ease much further from the actual levels. And that’s a problem because inflation tends to be self-fulfilling. In numbers, the headline inflation is expected to have steadied at 3.1% y-o-y, core inflation is expected to have eased from 3.9% to 3.7% y-o-y, but monthly headline figure could pause problem. A data set in line with expectations, or ideally lower than expected, should reinforce the Fed cut expectations for June, pull the US yields and the dollar lower. A higher-than-expected set of inflation data should soften the Fed doves’ hand and trigger a selloff in US treasuries, a rebound in US yields and the dollar. I think that there is a chance that we have a bad surprise. For equities, volatility will certainly be on the menu of the day, as the Fed’s data-dependent approach results in an increased focus on inflation data. Bloomberg data shows that over the past six months, the S&P500 moved 0.8% up or down on average after the release of CPI data. And this number will likely go up in the run up to the first Fed rate cut. In the meantime, Germany will release its own inflation numbers, which should print a softer yearly, and a higher monthly figure. The EURUSD retreated from post-NFP peak at yesterday’s session on expectation that the European Central Bank (ECB) will cut more than the Fed this year due to a softer economic outlook and fading pressure on wages, while yen traders are busy gathering evidence to justify a rate hike in Japan. Yesterday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) didn’t intervene to slow the bleeding while Topix fell more than 2%. That has been perceived as a sign that the BoJ is preparing to exit the ultra-loose monetary policy. And this morning, the PPI data came in higher-than-expected to support the expectation that Japan shall move maybe in March, maybe in April, more probably in April than in March. But note that the USDJPY is higher this morning a...",2

"NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series to use 28Gbps GDDR7 memory, 33% higher bandwidth than RTX 4090",2024-03-12T05:31:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96760/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-to-use-28gbps-gddr7-memory-33-higher-bandwidth-than-4090/index.html,"NVIDIA's next-gen GeForce RTX 50 Series of GPUs, the 'Blackwell' generation, is on track to launch either later this year or early next year, with the flagship GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 leading the pack. Rumors point to impressive performance gains, part of which could come from NVIDIA's use of next-gen GDDR7 memory. We've been following this closely here at TweakTown, with recent word from a well-known industry insider and leaker ""kopite7kimi"" confirming on X that the flagship Blackwell GPUs in the upcoming GeForce RTX 50 Series would be using a similar memory interface as the existing GeForce RTX 40 Series. That would mean the same 384-bit for the GeForce RTX 5090 found in the GeForce RTX 4090. So, where does GDDR7 fit into this picture? Especially now, with new info emerging about its speed. The new memory is faster, so we're bound to see a sizable increase in memory bandwidth. Following up on our story from the other day, ""kopite7kimi"" is now saying NVIDIA will be using GDDR7 memory with a speed of 28 Gbps-not the 32 Gbps that has been reported. The result would be at least a 33% increase in memory bandwidth for the GeForce RTX 5090 compared to the GeForce RTX 4090 with the same interface. This also means we probably shouldn't expect a significant increase in VRAM or memory capacity with the GeForce RTX 5090 (as models will feature similar memory interfaces to the current GeForce RTX 40 Series). However, to add another layer to what the new flagship GPU (GB202) for the GeForce RTX 50 Series might look like, kopite7kimi is now stating that a 512-bit memory interface is coming for the flagship, so the RTX 5090 could very well end up being a 32GB card - with a whopping 1792 GB/s of bandwidth! Seeing the RTX 5090 launch with 32GB or 48GB of GDDR7 memory would be awesome. As would seeing the GeForce RTX 5080 arrive with 24GB of GDDR7 on a 384-bit interface.

"Nvidia RTX 50-series graphics cards: news, release date, price, and more",2024-03-11T22:38:45+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/nvidia-rtx-50-series-release-date-price-news-rumors/,"Nvidia already makes some of the best graphics cards, but it’s also not resting on its laurels. Although the RTX 40-series, which has been bolstered by a refresh, is still very recent, Nvidia is also working on its next-gen GPUs from the RTX 50-series. The release date of RTX 50-series GPUs is still far away, but various rumors and leaks give us a better idea of what to expect. Here’s everything we know about Nvidia’s upcoming generation of graphics cards. With the release of RTX 50-series GPUs still a long while away, Nvidia hasn’t confirmed any specifications for any of the cards. In fact, we’re not even sure which models are on the way. However, piecing together speculation from various hardware leakers gives us some idea of what we can expect. Remember to take the following with a healthy dose of skepticism until Nvidia itself spills the beans. TSMC3 &mdash; kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) November 15, 2023 We know for a fact that the follow-up to Ada Lovelace will be called Blackwell, honoring American mathematician David Blackwell. Rumor has it that it will be manufactured by TSMC based on a 3nm process, but it’s unclear whether Nvidia will be using one of TSMC’s existing 3nm nodes or a custom node. The lineup is said to include chips spanning from the high-end, RTX 4090-equivalent GB202 through the GB203, GB205, GB206, and entry-level GB207. If proven true, this will be an interesting, or perhaps worrying, change. It would mean that the AD104 GPU powering the RTX 4070 has no successor in the next generation. It’s possible that the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti might, therefore, utilize the GB205 chip. One of the most talkative sources of information on the RTX 50-series has been kopite7kimi on X (formerly Twitter). The leaker revealed that we can expect the new GPUs to feature support for DisplayPort 2.1, something that the Lovelace lineup doesn’t provide, and also for HDMI 2.1. I think my persistence is correct. So the difference is that GB202 is 512-bit and AD102 is 384-bit. &mdash; kopite7kimi (@kopite7kimi) March 11, 2024 Kopite’s latest update talks about the memory interface for Blackwell. The leaker now states that the flagship card will indeed have a 512-bit memory bus, despite their previous statements that it would stick to 384-bit. The maximum bus width of Blackwell has been a very contentious topic among popular leakers, so it’s hard to know what’s true. However, one thing that they all agree on is that Nvidia will use the new GDDR7 memory standard, which AMD is said not to be using in its upcoming RDNA 4 lineup. The leaker also updated the expectations for the speed of those GDDR7 memory modules found in the RTX 50-series. Despite previous rumors that stated we might see 32Gb/s modules right out of the gate, kopite7kimi says that Nvidia will use 28Gb/s for this generation. This still marks a solid upgrade over Ada, delivering up to 1.8TB/s of memory bandwidth on the rumored RTX 5090 — assuming the 512-bit memory bus checks out. A recent...",3

New AI copyright lawsuit targets Nvidia,2024-03-11T21:55:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3714286/new-ai-copyright-lawsuit-targets-nvidia.html#tk.rss_all,"
  Three authors, Abdi Nazemian, Brian Keene, and Stewart O’Nan, are part of a new copyright infringement lawsuit against Nvidia, the latest such suit to challenge generative AI providers’ reliance on the “fair use” doctrine to acquire copyrighted material to train their large language models. The suit, filed late last week, is similar to other suits against generative AI creators, in that it alleges that they used copyrighted material — in this case, works of fiction by the named authors — as training data for an LLM. In this case, the LLM is Nvidia’s NeMo Megatron series, which, according to the complaint, uses several data sets known to contain the authors’ copyrighted material and used without permission. Specifically, the “Books3” dataset seems to be at the heart of the matter. This comprises 108GB of data and is a copy of the Bibliotik private tracker — one of several “shadow library” sites that have a long-standing place in the LLM development world, since they “host and distribute vast quantities of unlicensed copyrighted material,” according to the complaint. The authors ask for monetary damages and “destruction … of all copies [Nvidia] made or used in violation of the exclusive rights of the Plaintiffs.” The authors are represented by the Joseph Saveri Law Firm, which is already representing other groups of creative professionals in their suits against major AI providers. Comedian and writer Sarah Silverman is part of one such suit, filed in July 2023, against OpenAI and Meta, while another class action names authors Mona Awad and Paul Tremblay as lead plaintiffs. Like the other suits, the case was filed in federal district court in the Northern District of California. (Copyright cases, which are governed exclusively by federal law, are always heard by federal courts.) All of these suits hinge on the concept of “fair use,” which is a set of exceptions to US copyright law that allow, in some cases, for the reproduction or other use of copyrighted works without permission. The legal test for whether a particular activity qualifies as fair use, according to the Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center, asks judges to look at four factors, which are the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and “substantiality” of the portion of the work used, and use’s effects on the copyright holder’s market for the work. Defendant AI creators like Nvidia are likely to argue that their use of the copyrighted works is transformative and much different than the original creators’ use would be, and that the use of the books for AI training is unlikely have much of an impact on the market for prospective readers. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, are likely to point to the ingestion of multiple works in full and the commercial nature of Nvidia’s use of the books as arguments against fair use. Nvidia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jon Gold covers IoT and wireless networking for Network World.

Old Nvidia GPUs just got a big upgrade,2024-03-11T15:16:10+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/modders-crack-rebar-old-nvidia-gpus/,"Modders have just given Nvidia’s RTX 20-series and GTX 16-series GPUs a big upgrade. The mod is called NvStrapsReBar, and as the name suggests, it adds Resizable Bar (ReBAR) support to older Nvidia graphics cards. ReBAR is an essential feature on modern GPUs, supported by Nvidia and AMD, and explicitly required for Intel’s Arc graphics cards. However, it wasn’t introduced until AMD’s RX 6000 and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics cards. Developer Terminatorul has devised a solution by modifying the UEFI of your motherboard. Features like ReBAR are enabled by a BIOS file on your video card. Called a vBIOS, this basic program gets the card operating and communicating with your motherboard, and it notes certain perimeters like the GPU’s maximum clock speed. The problem is that vBIOS files are digitally signed and encrypted — you can’t mess with them without some serious modding. Terminatorul’s solution doesn’t mess with your vBIOS. Instead, it’s focused on your motherboard’s UEFI. The basic process works like this — you make a copy of the BIOS file on your motherboard and add the ReBAR driver to it. Then, you need to reflash the BIOS on your motherboard before running a program from within Windows, where you can set parameters like the BAR size. On the official GitHub page, detailed instructions are available. Although this mod is a big development for older Nvidia GPUs, it’s not free of issues. Because the mod goes through your motherboard’s UEFI, you’ll need to disable ReBAR and start the process over again if you swap GPUs. In addition, new versions of the mod require you to reflash your BIOS. There’s also the issue with Nvidia’s support for ReBAR. Unless explicitly supported, you’ll need to use the Nvidia Profile Inspector to enable the feature on a per-game basis. Even with those problems, the mod is working. Terminatorul has been collecting community reports since December of last year, and they’ve gathered quite a list of supported configurations. If you’re sitting on a GTX 16-series or RTX 20-series GPU and want to give the mod a shot, you can download everything you need from GitHub. Keep in mind that messing with a BIOS file and reflashing carries some risk of bricking your motherboard, so only attempt the mod if you’re confident in this type of modding and willing to accept that risk. For most people, the mod isn’t worth it. From our testing of ReBAR on Nvidia GPUs, there are only a handful of games that see a meaningful performance benefit.  Even among games that see an improvement, it’s usually only a small performance boost. If you’re looking to upgrade your PC gaming experience, a new graphics card is probably your best bet — our list of the best graphics cards can point you in the right direction for an upgrade. Whether you pick the RTX 4080 Super or the RX 7900 XTX, you're getting a powerful GPU that's capable of seamless gaming at 4K. But which one is better for the money? There used to be a clear answer to that question when we were ...",-2

Older GeForce cards get ReBAR support with new mod,2024-03-11T14:12:22+00:00,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2262043/older-geforce-cards-get-rebar-support-with-new-mod.html,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. PCIe Resizable BAR (Base Address Memory) lets the video memory on your graphics card communicate with your processor more efficiently, potentially increasing gaming performance, but it’s a relatively recent development. Nvidia cards only started supporting ReBAR with the GeForce RTX 30 series. A new mod has enabled slightly older cards, those in the RTX 20 and GTX 16 series, to get access to this performance boost.  The “NvStrapsReBar” tool on GitHub is a modification to recent UEFI/BIOS systems (the stuff that shows up on your boot screen before Windows), allowing ReBAR to run on these slightly outdated cards. It’s based on another popular mod, ReBarUEFI, bringing support for ReBar to processors as far back as 2011.  Further reading: Why PC gamers shouldn’t waste money on a PCIe 5.0 SSD The new mod is a little tricky, but should be doable for anyone with enough tech savvy to edit registry files. Sadly the support is a bit more narrow than the mod on which it’s based, with the extremely popular GTX 10 series left out in the cold (as noted by VideoCardz.com).  Still, the GTX 1650 and RTX 2060 are the #2 and #3 GPUs for gamers according to the latest Steam hardware survey, so this mod could add a little extra oomph for a lot of users.

Nvidia is sued by authors over AI use of copyrighted works,2024-03-11T10:36:20+00:00,https://www.zeebiz.com/companies/news-nvidia-is-sued-by-authors-over-ai-use-of-copyrighted-works-279713,"Nvidia whose chips power artificial intelligence, has been sued by three authors who said it used their copyrighted books without permission to train its NeMo, opens new tab AI platform. Brian Keene, Abdi Nazemian and Stewart O'Nan said their works were part of a dataset of about 196,640 books that helped train NeMo to simulate ordinary written language, before being taken down in October ""due to reported copyright infringement."" In a proposed class action filed on Friday night in San Francisco federal court, the authors said the takedown reflects Nvidia's having ""admitted"" it trained NeMo on the dataset, and thereby infringed their copyrights. They are seeking unspecified damages for people in the United States whose copyrighted works helped train NeMo's so-called large language models in the last three years. Among the works covered by the lawsuit are Keene's 2008 novel ""Ghost Walk,"" Nazemian's 2019 novel ""Like a Love Story,"" and O'Nan's 2007 novella ""Last Night at the Lobster."" Nvidia declined to comment on Sunday. Lawyers for the authors did not immediately respond to requests on Sunday for additional comment. The lawsuit drags Nvidia into a growing body of litigation by writers, as well as the New York Times, over generative AI, which creates new content based on inputs such as text, images and sounds. Nvidia touts NeMo as a fast and affordable way to adopt generative AI, opens new tab. Other companies sued over the technology have included OpenAI, which created the AI platform ChatGPT, and its partner Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab. AI's rise has made Nvidia a favorite of investors. The Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker's stock price has risen almost 600% since the end of 2022, giving Nvidia a market value of nearly $2.2 trillion.

Warning: What Nvidia Dropping 5.55% Means Today,2024-03-11T10:26:00+00:00,http://www.baystreet.ca/articles/stockstowatch.aspx?id=17374," Investors who piled onto Nvidia (NVDA) before it posted spectacular revenue and profit growth did well. NVDA stock rose from $600 to a high of $974. Last Friday may mark a peak price for the graphics server chip supplier. Momentum investors may begin to question the long-term longevity of the AI market. Governments may step in at any time to introduce regulations to slow AI’s rise. It may evaluate the pace of AI’s innovations excludes enough checks and balances of a reliable system. AI runs on a probabilistic algorithm. In return for outputting answers quickly, accuracy is not 100%. This would limit AI’s use cases in sectors that require 99.999% precision. Nvidia’s rise pulled Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock to as high as $227.30. At a forward P/E of 56.84, AMD shares trade at a higher valuation than that of Nvidia. AMD is often behind Nvidia in the desktop PC market. Chances are high that it will fail to take Nvidia’s market share in the AI server market, too. Intel (INTC), despite looking cheap as it trades in a $30 - $46 range, is at risk of falling. Its forward P/E is 32.2 times, comparable to Nvidia’s forward P/E of 35.59 times.

Nvidia sued for allegedly using copyrighted books to train AI,2024-03-11T08:13:42+00:00,https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/nvidia-sued-authors-nemo-ai-copyright,"
by Leigh Mc Gowran
 
11 Mar 2024  Image: © Tada Images/Stock.adobe.com Nvidia has joined the list of companies facing lawsuits over claims that copyrighted material is being used to train their AI models. Nvidia is facing legal trouble from a trio of authors, who claim the company used copyrighted books to train one of its AI models. The US dispute – first reported by Reuters – involves authors Brian Keene, Abdi Nazemian and Stewart O’Nan, who claim their works were included in a dataset used to train NeMo, a Nvidia framework that is designed to build and customise generative AI models. This dataset was taken down last October for reported copyright infringement. The three authors are seeking damages for copyrighted works that helped train NeMo’s large language models in the last three years, Reuters reports. The copyright dispute was filed with the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The case is the latest in the growing issue of copyright infringement for AI companies. Last year saw a number of authors file suits against both OpenAI and Meta, with claims that their AI models used their books as training material. Those lawsuits claimed the large language models developed by Meta and OpenAI were trained on illegal “shadow libraries” – websites that contain pirated versions of the authors’ books. Last year also saw thousands sign a letter written by the US Authors Guild, calling on the likes of OpenAI, Alphabet and Meta to stop using their work to train AI models without “consent, credit or compensation”. Towards the end of 2023, The New York Times stepped into the ring with a high-profile lawsuit against both OpenAI and Microsoft. The media outlet claimed AI models such as ChatGPT have copied and use millions of copyrighted news articles, in-depth investigations and other journalistic work. In January, OpenAI said it was “surprised and disappointed” by the lawsuit and added the newspaper was “not telling the full story”. It followed up in February with a claim that The New York Times “paid someone to hack OpenAI’s products” to generate “highly anomalous results” used as evidence in its AI copyright case. In a statement sent to SiliconRepublic.com, Ian Crosby, a partner at Susman Godfrey and lead counsel for The New York Times, noted that OpenAI did not dispute that it copied millions of articles from the media outlet to build its products. OpenAI is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed last year, which claims the company scraped the internet to train its generative AI chatbot and potentially violated the rights of millions as a result.

NVIDIA sued by three authors for copyright infringement,2024-03-11T05:02:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96752/nvidia-sued-by-three-authors-for-copyright-infringement/index.html,"Three authors have sued chipmaker NVIDIA, claiming the company used their books without their permission to train its AI platform, NeMo. The proposed class action lawsuit was filed last Friday in San Francisco federal court and claimed that NVIDIA had used the author's books without their permission in the dataset used to train the NeMo AI platform, which is designed to simulate ordinary written language. The lawsuit didn't specify the damages the authors are seeking, but according to the lawsuit, the following books were used to train the AI model: Keene's 2008 novel ""Ghost Walk,"" Nazemian's 2019 novel ""Like a Love Story,"" and O'Nan's 2007 novella ""Last Night at the Lobster."" Notably, the dataset used to train NeMo contains nearly 200,000 books, but NVIDIA removed the dataset in October 2023 due to copyright infringement claims. However, the authors behind the lawsuit claim that NVIDIA's decision to remove the dataset is an admission of guilt. At the time of writing, NVIDIA hasn't commented on the lawsuit, but if it does respond, we will be sure to update you. NVIDIA is joining the growing list of tech companies facing lawsuits for using datasets that contain copywritten content to train generative AI platforms.

                                                 Stock market today: Asian shares are mostly higher ahead of a US report on inflation                                                  BEIJING (AP) — Shares were mostly higher in Asia on Tuesday ahead of a report on inflation in the U.S. that could sway the Federal Reserve’s timing on cutting interest rates.  U.S. futures and oil prices were higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 0.6% to 38,586.92, retreating further from its recent record highs as expectations build that the central bank will raise its negative benchmark interest rate next month.  That speculation has pushed the Japanese yen higher against the U.S. dollar. Early Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 147.40 yen, up from 146.95 yen. Recently the dollar was trading at about 150 yen.  Chinese markets were mixed, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng up 1.2% at 16,781.91, while the Shanghai Composite index slipped 0.4% to 3,056.35.  Elsewhere in Asia, the S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% higher to 7,712.20. South Korea’s Kospi advanced 04% to 2,671.26.  On Monday, the S&P 500 slipped 0.1% to 5,117.94, remaining near its all-time high set Thursday. Prices have been buoyed by expectations that cuts to interest rates are coming this year and by signals that the economy remains remarkably resilient. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% to 38,769.66 and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.4% to 16,019.27. Tuesday’s report on prices Americans pay could show inflation remained at 3.1% in February, if economists’ forecasts are correct. A month ago, a hotter-than-expected report on inflation at the consumer level sent financial markets spinning. But the trend for inflation has been mostly downward, cooling toward the Fed’s 2% target from its peak above 9%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell Jerome Powell said last week the Fed is “not far” from getting enough confidence about inflation to begin cutting rates. Cuts to the Fed’s main interest rate, which is at its highest level since 2001, would relax pressure on the economy and financial system, while goosing investment prices. The general expectation among traders is that the Fed will begin cutting rates in June.  Expectations for easier interest rates have helped the price of gold rally to a record. When bonds pay less in interest, investors lose out on less income by owning gold instead. Gold for delivery in April ticked up by $3.10 to settle at $2,188.60 per ounce. Gold prices are up about 17% over the last 12 months. Bitcoin, which proponents sometimes pitch as “digital gold,” also rallied to another record. It rose to nearly $73,000 after sitting below $17,000 at the start of last year. It’s more than bounced back from its prior prior peak of nearly $69,000. On Wall Street, Oracle rose 1.5% before it released its latest earnings report after trading finished for the day. Its profit topped analysts’ expectations, and ...",0

NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang says next-gen DGX AI system will be liquid cooled,2024-03-10T23:39:02+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96744/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-next-gen-dgx-ai-system-will-be-liquid-cooled/index.html,"NVIDIA is preparing its next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture as you're reading this, but now NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang has said that the company's next DGX AI system will be liquid-cooled. This might not seem like much, but data centers aren't easy to liquid cool... it will be a huge infrastructure investment to continue down this path, but the insatiable demand for AI is driving it down this road. NVIDIA's next-gen Blackwell B100 AI GPU is expected to be unveiled at NVIDIA's upcoming GPU Technology Conference (GTC) event, while Dell recently teased the beefed-up B200 for 2025. NVIDIA's next-gen B200 AI GPU is expected to draw 1000W+ of power when it drops in 2025, so hearing Jensen talk about the new DGX AI system being liquid-cooled makes sense if you consider those power numbers. Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and Chief Analyst Patrick Moorhead posted on X: ""So we've pulled nearly every lever so far to optimize performance at a kinda reasonable degree of heat/power: Node shrinks, disaggregated designs and packaging. What's next, liquid nitrogen? Optical packaging? Hard move to ASICs? Faster networking? Seems like we need to press the reset button on something as we're running into a wall."" Dell COO and Vice Chairman Jeff Clarke said last week: ""We're excited about what happens at the B100 and the B200, and we think that's where there's actually another opportunity to distinguish engineering confidence. Our characterization in the thermal side, you really don't need direct liquid cooling to get to the energy density of 1000 watts per GPU"". ""That happens next year with the B200. The opportunity for us really to showcase our engineering and how fast we can move and the work that we've done as an industry leader to bring our expertise to make liquid cooling perform at scale"".

Some of the biggest names in the industry were lined up to support Blackwell, including AWS. The two companies have announced they are extending their existing collaboration, delivering new Blackwell-powered options: “The deep collaboration between our two organizations goes back more than 13 years, when together we launched the world’s first GPU cloud instance on AWS, and today we offer the widest range of NVIDIA GPU solutions for customers,” said Adam Selipsky, CEO at AWS. “NVIDIA’s next-generation Grace Blackwell processor marks a significant step forward in generative AI and GPU computing. When combined with AWS’s powerful Elastic Fabric Adapter Networking, Amazon EC2 UltraClusters’ hyper-scale clustering, and our unique Nitro system’s advanced virtualization and security capabilities, we make it possible for customers to build and run multi-trillion parameter large language models (LLMs) faster, at massive scale, and more securely than anywhere else.” As part of their collaboration, the two companies are working on a new supercomputer powered by Blackwell: First announced at AWS re:Invent 2023, the AI supercomputer collaboration between AWS and NVIDIA dubbed Project Ceiba will now also use the Blackwell platform. The cloud-based computing phenom will be capable of processing a massive 414 exaflops of AI—a 6x performance increase over earlier plans. What that all boils down to is one of the world’s fastest supercomputers hosted exclusively on AWS for the use of NVIDIA’s internal research and development team working on advancing the application of AI to graphics and simulation, digital biology, robotics, self-driving cars, climate prediction, and more. “AI is driving breakthroughs at an unprecedented pace, leading to new applications, business models, and innovation across industries,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Our collaboration with AWS is accelerating new generative AI capabilities and providing customers with unprecedented computing power to push the boundaries of what’s possible.” Get the free daily newsletter read by decision makers Get our media kit Deliver your marketing message directly to decision makers.",3

Ozempic profits are helping fund a new Nvidia-powered AI supercomputer,2024-03-20T11:16:24+00:00,https://kesq.com/money/cnn-business-consumer/2024/03/20/the-maker-of-ozempic-is-funding-a-new-nvidia-powered-ai-supercomputer/," By Olesya Dmitracova, CNN London (CNN) — The owner of Novo Nordisk, the drugmaker that gave the world Ozempic and Wegovy, is funding a new supercomputer powered by Nvidia’s artificial intelligence technology with a key aim of discovering new medicines and treatments. The Novo Nordisk Foundation has awarded France’s Eviden a contract to build what the computing company says will be one of the world’s most powerful supercomputers, able to process vast amounts of data using AI. It should provide “unprecedented potential to accelerate groundbreaking scientific discoveries in areas such as drug discovery, disease diagnosis and treatment,” Cédric Bourrasset, Eviden’s head of quantum computing, said in a statement. The supercomputer is expected to be ready for pilot projects before the end of the year and will be housed in Denmark’s national center for AI innovation. Named Gefion, the supercomputer will be available for use by researchers from Denmark’s public and private sectors, and will enjoy the backing of two of the hottest companies in the United States and Europe. Nvidia is now one of the largest companies on the US stock market, valued at $2.21 trillion. The new supercomputer will use Nvidia’s latest chip technology. The foundation, meanwhile, has a controlling stake in Novo Nordisk (NVO), a company worth more than Tesla. Its business is booming thanks to the widespread use of its diabetes drug Ozempic for weight loss and the popularity of Wegovy, which contains the same active ingredient as Ozempic. AI’s potential to speed up scientific research was highlighted earlier this year when Microsoft (MSFT) said that a new battery material had been found “in a matter of weeks, not years.” The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, part of the US Department of Energy, used a Microsoft system that includes AI models and high-performance computing to winnow 32 million potential inorganic materials to 18 promising candidates in less than four days, Microsoft said in January. Writing about its collaboration with Microsoft, the PNNL said on its website: “The entire process, from receiving the simulated candidates through producing a functioning battery, took less than nine months, a blink of an eye compared with traditional methods.” The-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Flutterwave, Africa’s leading payments technology company, has been ranked No. 1 in Fast Company’s Most Innovative Company for Europe, Middle East, and Africa 2024, joining others like Nvidia, Open AI, or YouTube on the list.

Innovation is an integral part of our core values, which we continue to adopt across all parts of our business. Every day, we come to work, and we live and breathe innovation.

The financial technology company joins the ranks of Nvidia, Apple, and more after a banner year of growth LOS ANGELES–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Altruist has been named to Fast Company’s prestigious list of the World’s Most Innovative Companies of 2024.  
This year’s list shines a spotlight on businesses that are shaping industry and culture through their innovations. These organizations are setting new standards and achieving remarkable milestones in all sectors of the economy. Alongside the World’s 50 Most Innovative Companies, Fast Company recognizes 606 organizations across 58 sectors and regions. 
Altruist is the modern custodian built by serial entrepreneur and wealth management industry veteran Jason Wenk, who recognized that despite increasing demand for independent financial advice, the registered investment advisor (RIA) market’s growth was stifled by outdated technology and inefficient service models. Evidenced by last year’s acquisition of TD Ameritrade by Schwab, independent advisors have long been underserved by the industry incumbents who provide archaic solutions to clients’ modern concerns. 
Jason and his team set out to redefine what it means to offer and receive quality financial advice. The company is on a mission to make independent financial advice better, more affordable, and accessible to everyone. Since its inception in 2018, Altruist raised more than $290 million, acquired award-winning brokerage and custodial platform Shareholders Service Group, and ascended to the third-largest custodian by advisors served – a testament to the RIA market’s desire for a modern, service-oriented, and purpose-built custodian. This year, industry analyst T3 named Altruist as the #1 custodian advisors are considering switching to. 
“We’re laser-focused on creating a future where every RIA, whether established or emerging, can truly focus on their clients, and eliminate wasted time on complicated tech integrations or laborious administrative work,” said Jason Wenk, CEO of Altruist. 
The World’s Most Innovative Companies stands as Fast Company‘s hallmark franchise and one of its most anticipated editorial efforts of the year. 
Fast Company‘s editors and writers identified the companies driving progress around the world and across industries, evaluating thousands of submissions through a competitive application process. The result is a globe-spanning guide to innovation today, from early-stage startups to some of the most valuable companies in the world. Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies package is available online, as well as in-app form via iTunes, and on newsstands beginning March 26. The hashtag is #FCMostInnovative. 
“Our list of the Most Innovative Companies is both a comprehensive look at the innovation economy and a snapshot of the business trends that defined the year,” said Fast Company editor-in-chief Brendan Vaughan. “We saw extraordinary innovation across the board in 2023, b...",0

Samsung Jumps Most In Six Months After Nvidia CEO’s Backing,2024-03-20T09:22:39+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/samsung-jumps-most-in-six-months-after-nvidia-ceo-s-endorsement,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. gained its most in more than six months after Nikkei Asia reported Nvidia Corp. is looking to buy its high-bandwidth memory chips, marking a milestone for Korea’s largest company. The report shored up investor hopes that Samsung — long the dominant player in global memory semiconductors — will close the gap with smaller rival SK Hynix Inc. in the critical field of AI. On Wednesday, executives told shareholders at their annual meeting Samsung aims to be first in the global chip market within two to three years, including by investing in capacity for high-bandwidth memory, or HBM. This type of semiconductor is best suited to work with the AI accelerators that Nvidia specializes in. Samsung’s chip business should recover to 2022 levels this year, as a longstanding market slump begins to end, executives said. Already the undisputed leader in AI semiconductors, Nvidia this week unveiled the next generation of its hardware, called Blackwell. Samsung’s shares surged as much as 6% in Seoul after Nvidia founder Jensen Huang told reporters his company planned to also use it as an HBM supplier, according to the newspaper. “I value our partnership with SK Hynix and Samsung very incredibly,” it quoted Huang as saying. Huang’s endorsement of various partners this week has boosted shares in the likes of Synopsys Inc. Hynix’s own head-start in HBM — which is ideally designed to make the most of Nvidia’s chips — had helped its shares double in value since the start of 2023, far outstripping Samsung’s roughly 39% gain. “We see a very high possibility that Samsung will qualify for supplying HBM3E to Nvidia’s latest chips,” said Sanjeev Rana, head of Korea Research at CLSA. “The demand for Nvidia’s GPUs is very strong, but given the limited HBM capacity at Hynix and Micron, it is very likely that Nvidia will need to rely on another supplier to meet the strong demand for its chips.” Read More: Nvidia CEO Becomes Kingmaker by Name-Dropping Stocks HBM is a key part of Samsung’s effort to be the world’s leading chipmaker, as the one part of the memory market where Samsung doesn’t enjoy a clear lead over its competition. The company said its HBM sales rose by more than 40% in the December quarter, and that memory demand showed signs of recovery. But Hynix is also investing in capacity and technology to safeguard its advantage. Among other things, it’s placing a bet on advanced chip packaging that it thinks will grant it a crucial edge. Samsung is pushing its own advanced packaging business after setting up a dedicated team last year, said Kyung Kye-Hyun, who heads the semiconductor business.

Snowflake Expands Collaboration With Nvidia To Deliver Full-Stack AI Platform For Enterprises,2024-03-20T08:54:42+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/snowflake-expands-collaboration-with-nvidia-to-deliver-full-stack-ai-platform-for-enterprises,"Data cloud company Snowflake Inc. has expanded its collaboration with Nvidia Corp. to deliver enterprises a full-stack artificial intelligence platform that integrates Nvidia’s accelerated computing with Snowflake’s Data Cloud.  The combination of infrastructure and compute capabilities aims to accelerate AI productivity and enable business transformations across industries. With previously announced Nvidia NeMo integration, Snowflake customers will be able to utilise NeMo Retriever directly on their proprietary data in the Data Cloud, while maintaining data security, privacy and governance, Snowflake said. “Data is the fuel for AI, making it essential to establishing an effective AI strategy,” said Snowflake chief executive officer Sridhar Ramaswamy. "". Our partnership with Nvidia is delivering a secure, scalable and easy-to-use platform for trusted enterprise data."" NeMo Retriever enables scalability of chatbot applications and can accelerate time to value for enterprises building AI applications with Snowflake Cortex, a large language model and vector search service, the company said.  The expanded collaboration will also include the availability of Nvidia TensorRT software, aimed at delivering low latency and high throughput for deep learning inference applications to enhance LLM-based search capabilities. “Enterprise data is the foundation for custom AI applications that can generate intelligence and reveal new insights,” said Jensen Huang, founder and chief executive officer of Nvidia. “Bringing Nvidia accelerated computing and software to Snowflake’s data platform can turbocharge enterprise AI adoption by helping customers build, deploy and manage secure generative AI applications.” According to Snowflake, several of its AI products are powered by Nvidia’s accelerated computing, including: Snowflake Cortex LLM Functions: The product allows users with SQL skills to leverage smaller LLMs to cost-effectively address specific tasks, including sentiment analysis, translation and summarisation. More advanced use cases include the development of AI applications using performant models from Mistral AI, Meta and others. Snowflake Copilot: The LLM-powered assistant leverages generative AI for coding tasks with natural language. Users can ask questions of their data in plain text, write SQL queries against relevant data sets, refine queries and filter down insights. Document AI: Document AI helps enterprises use LLMs to extract content like invoice amounts or contractual terms from documents and fine-tune results using a visual interface and natural language. It can help teams reduce manual errors and increase efficiencies with automated document processing.",3
"Don’t Ask Cathie Wood About Nvidia, Or TSMC",2024-03-20T08:08:16+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/opinion/ai-rally-don-t-ask-cathie-wood-about-nvidia-or-tsmc,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Cathie Wood seems to have the worst timing on artificial intelligence stocks. She offloaded Nvidia Corp.’s shares in early 2023, failing to grasp the popularity and disruptive power of ChatGPT. In late February, she sold Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. for the first time in more than two years, thus missing out on the foundry’s recent melt-up as well. Perhaps to defend her losses, the founder of Ark Investment Management has been sounding the alarm on chip stocks lately. She warned that a lack of explosion in software revenue will slow companies’ AI infrastructure spending and that the lead time for Nvidia’s graphic processing units was already coming down. And unlike dot-com era market darling Cisco Systems Inc., Nvidia could face intense competition. Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc., for one, is designing its own chips, she said. Ark has been purchasing the EV maker’s beaten-down stock lately.  Given her track record, one has to take Wood’s comments with a grain of salt. Among providers of mutual and exchange-traded funds, Ark topped the chart in wealth destruction. Its family of ETFs, which managed around $16 billion as of 2023, wiped out $14.3 billion in shareholder value in the past decade, according to Morningstar Inc.  Her caution nonetheless resonates with those who worry we are nearing another dot-com burst. Positioning among AI winners is getting crowded. In the fourth quarter, hedge funds increased their Nvidia holdings by $2 billion, as the likes of Rokos Capital Management and Bridgewater Associates chased after the GPU chip designer’s scorching rally. Like the 1990s tech bubble or the Nifty Fifty optimism of the early 1970s, today’s market leader, Nvidia, is characterized by a soaring profit outlook. Notably, all of Nvidia’s price gains have been attributable to a higher stream of earnings, with its price-to-forward-earnings multiple largely unchanged since the start of 2023. But according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., there’s one key difference. Nvidia has much higher profit margin and return on equity, which might just support its future earnings better.  Meanwhile, trading in TSMC spiked up this year, with the stock gaining 11% this month alone. Foreigners are purchasing equities in Taiwan again, where TSMC is the crown jewel, despite geopolitical tensions between China and the US over the island.  This is perhaps a sign that the AI rally is broadening. In recent weeks, investors are diversifying away from Nvidia and identifying new AI beneficiaries. It’s a healthy development.  According to Goldman, here are possibly four phases in this AI trade. On center stage, of course, is Nvidia, which has returned 500% since the start of 2023 and has become overly popular. Phase two will likely focus on companies involved in the infrastructure needed for AI. Chip manufacturer TSMC and designer Arm Holdings Plc naturally come to mind. Next are firms that can incorporate AI in product offerings to boost revenues, such as...",2

Nvidia is probably the biggest benefactor of the AI trend, but it’s not content to sit on its laurels and sell billions of dollars in silicon. The company’s newest developer tool, the Avatar Cloud Engine, could help game devs make non-player characters in a fraction of the time it takes today.  On PCWorld’s The Full Nerd podcast, Nvidia Senior Product Manager Seth Schneider joins Adam and Will to show off this remarkable tech. The Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) goes beyond standard text and voice simulation to allow developers to customize NPCs with a range of contextual actions, giving each one a custom-tailored personality that reacts to the in-game environment.  The Covert Protocol playable demo showcases these completely AI-driven characters. And while you need to apply to get into the early access program for ACE from Nvidia and its partner Inworld, the company plans to release the source code for the demo in the near future.

Nasdaq 100: Deteriorating Market Breadth Does Not Bode Well for the Bulls,2024-03-28T09:24:43+00:00,https://www.actionforex.com/contributors/fundamental-analysis/545725-nasdaq-100-deteriorating-market-breadth-does-not-bode-well-for-the-bulls/,"Since the publication of our previous analysis, the price actions of the US Nas 100 Index (a proxy of the Nasdaq 100 future) have continued to surge upwards towards 18,270 and 18,435 resistance levels as flagged in our report. Thereafter, the red-hot Index rocketed to print another fresh all-time high of 18,497 on last Thursday, 21 March ex-post FOMC. The current major uptrend phases of the major US benchmark stock indices; S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones Industrial Average in place since their respective October 2023 lows have continued to oscillate in impulsive bullish up moves sequences without any medium-term multi-week correction corrective decline of -5% or more, except for the small-caps Rusell 2000 that saw a loss of -8.4% during the period of 26 December 2023 to 16 January 2024 (high to low). Over-concentration risk from Artificial Intelligence (AI) theme play  Fig 1: 2024 YTD performance of major US benchmark stock indices & key component stocks & ETFs as of 27 Mar 2024 (Source: TradingView, click to enlarge chart) Q1 2024 is ending soon with one more day to go, the year-to-date performances of the major US benchmark stock indices as of yesterday, 27 March look set to end positively with another second consecutive winning quarter led by the S&P 500 (+11.03%), and Nasdaq 100 (+10.50%) with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (5.42%) as well as Russell 2000 (+5.05%) trailing behind. The main significant star contributor has been the stellar bullish run of Nvidia that rocketed to a year-to-date return of +87.37% (with a current peak of +97.24%) due to its market leadership in producing bespoke semiconductor chips that are being used to power up the current in-demand hardware servers to run generative AI functions for corporations (see Fig 1). At this current rate of return seen in the share price of Nvidia has surpassed the returns of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 by around a multiple of 9 X, also due to the market capitalization weightage calculation of the component stocks that make up the S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100, Nvidia has risen to become the third-ranked component stock behind Apple, Microsoft with a weightage of 5.30%, and 6.60% respectively. In a nutshell, after a simple calculation using the current S&P 500, and Nasdaq 100 market cap weightage coupled with the current year-to-date return of +87.37% of Nvidia, the sole share price movement of Nvidia has contributed almost half the current-year-date return of S&P 500 at 42%, and a larger extend of 55% for Nasdaq 100. A lone star that is holding the fort without any significant bullish support from the rest has increased the risk of vulnerability to trigger a potential multi-week correction in the US benchmark stock indices if macro factors deteriorate such as a reduction in the Fed dovish pivot narrative in terms of the number of interest rate cuts for 2024 (currently three cuts are being priced in according to CME FedWatch Tool), a further uptick in the geopolitical risk premium, and t...",3

"Quanta Computer to make NVIDIA GB200-based AI servers for Google, Amazon, and Meta",2024-03-28T05:32:02+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97169/quanta-computer-to-make-nvidia-gb200-based-ai-servers-for-google-amazon-and-meta/index.html,"Quanta Computer is one of the largest OEM suppliers in the world, with new contracts won to build NVIDIA GB200 AI systems for the likes of Google, Amazon AWS, Meta, and some B200-based AI systems for Microsoft. The company will have its first GB200 AI servers in testing in July or August ""at the earliest"" reports UDN, with mass production expected in September. Quanta holds ""large OEM orders"" for GB200 servers from Google, Amazon AWS, and Meta which are provided as complete AI cabinets. Microsoft ordered some B200 servers, which means Quanta is building next-gen AI systems for all four major US cloud servers in one set of orders. NVIDIA's new GB200 cabinet AI servers cost around $2-3 million each, so we can expect some major revenues for NVIDIA in the second half of this year once these orders are processed. UDN reports that Quanta is ""optimistic"" that as a shortage of materials in the supply chain gets better, AI server shipments will increase as soon as May or June, while the second half of 2024 is expected to be an ""explosive period"". Quanta is expecting volume shipment in September, with Amazon AWS and Meta having their new NVIDIA GB200 AI servers up and running in the second half of the year. Once these US cloud service providers (CSPs) successfully expand, capital expenditure and customer demand is strong -- its insatiable right now, AI GPU demand -- UDN reports that Quanta's cloud business revenue will make up 40% of its yearly revenues in 2024, expected to pass notebook computers and become Quanta's biggest production line. NVIDIA's new B200 AI GPU can consume up to 1000W to 1200W depending on the configuration, with GB200 packages including 2 x B200 GPUs and a Grace CPU with powerful performance at the ready for AI workloads. The new GB200 and B200 AI GPUs will be the first to use water cooling, which is expected to make water cooling more mainstream in data center cooling markets. Quanta has recently developed liquid cooling technology through its subsidiary Werder Technology, which is said to be a ""major leap forward in water cooling technology"". Quanta has partnered with Singtel as a technology partner, where the companies will build a ""sustainable data center"" in Singapore, which will help the Singaporean government to super-speed their AI development.

AI workloads require ridiculous amount of throughput through the GPUs to process everything at full speed, with NVIDIA using its in-house custom NVLink and NVSwitch to offer massive GPU-to-GPU communication, offering up to 1.8TB/sec of bandwidth on GB200-powered systems. Not every customer wants the entire NVIDIA solution, which is where PCIe 5.0 x16 connections step in for the current fleet of AI GPUs, but Blackwell introduces PCIe 6.0, doubling the 128GB/sec of bandwidth of an x16 connection on PCIe 5.0 to a huge 256GB/sec bandwidth on PCIe 6.0 x16. Tom's Hardware spotted Astera Labs' new Aries Smart DSP retimers at NVIDIA GTC 2024, with the small chips boosting the PCIe 6.2 signal. The demo systems had boards running an active PCIe 6.2 link between the host on the left system, and the load generator on the right. Aries PCIe 6.0 retimers are found on the interposer board in the middle, ingesting and boosting the traffic between its dual PCIe 6.0 x16 connectors (one on each side of the retimer itself). Astera Labs had live power measurements of its new PCIe 6.0 retimer chip, which they're proud to say is the world's lowest-power retimer. Under full load, the chip had 11W of power draw, which is around 15% less than the 13W that is consumed under full load on PCIe 5.0, while pumping twice the bandwidth through it. The new PCIe 6.0 retimer silicon is on a newer TSMC process node (the company didn't state which node exactly), which helps with the power savings of its Astera Labs' new chip. Astera Labs' new PCIe 6.0 retimer will be used on a wide range of PCIe 6.0-powered devices, including GPUs, SSDs, NICs, and more, but they're all under NDA so we don't know anything about them just yet. Astera Labs' new PCIe 6.0 retimer (source: Tom's Hardware) PCIe 6.0 doubles the available bandwidth on an x16 connection to 256GB/sec, up from 128GB/sec, with the increase delivered from a switch to PAM-4 encoding instead of NRZ, with no frequency increase, so the reach/distance requirements are about the same. PAM-4 encoding is more susceptible to errors, so error rates have bumped even though the addition of forward error correction (FEC). Bandwidth has doubled, and error rates have increased, which reduces the effective bandwidth. High-end retimers can ensure signal integrity, with Astera Labs' customers either designing systems with longer trace lengths and accepting the error rates, or they can use short trace lengths to reduce error rates but boost bandwidth in the process. Astera Labs' already has a big customer with NVIDIA, with their retimers powering NVIDIA DGX HPU systems. The company had a current...",3
"MAINGEAR PRO AI workstation PC with Phison aiDaptiv+ platform: uses SSDs, DRAM to boost AI perf",2024-03-28T03:28:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97165/maingear-pro-ai-workstation-pc-with-phison-aidaptiv-platform-uses-ssds-dram-to-boost-perf/index.html,"Phison had something very cool to show off at NVIDIA GTC 2024 last week, with a single MAINGEAR PRO AI workstation PC packing 4 x NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada workstation GPUs using its in-house aiDaptiv+ software to use SSDs and DRAM to make up for the lack of VRAM, using it to super-speed AI workloads on the cheap. By cheap, we mean cheaper than using full-fledged NVIDIA Hopper H100 or new H200 AI GPUs, let alone the next-gen Blackwell B100 and B200 AI GPUs that will be very hard to come by this year, and a huge chunk into 2025. Phison's aim with its aiDaptiv+ platform is to lower the (cost) barrier of AI LLM training by using systems' already-there DRAM and SSDs to augment the amount of GPU VRAM available for AI training. Phison says that achieving intense generative AI training workloads at a far lower cost than using standard GPUs will come at a cost: reduced AI training performance and longer training times. If you want the best, you'll spend magnitudes more money on it, but more off-the-shelf AI systems from the likes of MAINGEAR and its PRO AI system, putting Phison's new aiDaptiv+ platform in between is a big win. With customers like small and medium-sized businesses and companies without hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions of dollars for high-end DGX AI GPU workstations from NVIDIA, AI training upgraded through SSDs and DRAM already in the system is very appealing. There are huge cost savings involved, with aiDaptiv+ speeding along the process. Phison showed off a demo of its aiDaptiv+ platform running on a MAINGEAR PRO AI workstation PC at GTC 2024 last week, with its 4 x NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada workstation GPUs running a gigantic 70 billion parameter model. Phison estimates that the size to train 70 billion parameters is around 1.4TB/sec VRAM used through a massive 24 x GPU system across 6 x servers in a server rack. This is a lot of hardware, power, and cooling that needs to be worked out, with Phison's new aiDaptiv+ system acting as as middleware software library that the company says ""slices"" off layers of the AI model from the VRAM that isn't actively being computed, and shoots them over to the system DRAM. From there, the data can stay on the DRAM, or, if it's needed sooner, it can be sent over to the SSDs if they've got a lower priority. The data is then recalled and shifted back over to the VRAM on the GPU for computation tasks as required, with the newly-processed layer flushed to the DRAM and SSD to make room to process the next layer. MAINGEAR used its new PRO AI workstation PC for Phison's new aiDaptiv+ platform test, powered by an Intel Xeon W7-3435X processor, 512GB of DDR5-5600 memory, and two specialized Phison SSDs in 2TB. MAINGEAR starts the pricing of its PRO AI workstation at $28,000 with a single GPU, or up to $60,000 if you equip it with a monster 4-way RTX 6000 Ada workstation GPU. Phison's new aiDaptiveCache ai100E SSDs are found in the regular M.2 form factor, but are specially designed for caching workloads. We do...",1
NVIDIA's new Hopper H200 AI GPU tested: 3x faster GenAI with TensorRT-LLM in MLPerf 4.0 results,2024-03-28T01:32:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97156/nvidia-new-hopper-h200-ai-gpu-tested-3x-faster-genai-with-tensorrt-llm-in-mlperf-4-0-results/index.html,"NVIDIA might have just announced its next-generation Blackwell B200 AI GPU, but the beefed-up Hopper H200 AI GPU is smashing performance records in the very latest MLPerf 4.0 results. NVIDIA's optimizations on TensorRT-LLM have been a non-stop chain of progression since the company released its AI Software suite last year. There were major performance increases from MLPerf 3.1 results to MLPerf 4.0, with NVIDIA amplifying Hopper's AI performance. Using these new TensorRT-LLM optimizations, NVIDIA has pulled out a huge 2.4x performance leap with its current H100 AI GPU in MLPerf Inference 3.1 to 4.0 with GPT-J tests using an offline scenario. With server-based scenarios using GPT-J, NVIDIA's current H100 AI GPU had a huge 2.9x increase in MLPerf 3.1 to 4.0 performance. Moving onto the beefed-up H200 AI GPU and Llama 2 70B benchmarks, NVIDIA's new H200 AI GPU and TensorRT-LLM set a new MLPerf record. NVIDIA's new H200 Tensor Core GPU is a drop-in upgrade for an instant performance boost over H100, with 141GB of HBM3E (80GB HBM3 on H100) and up to 4.8TB/sec of memory bandwidth with H200 versus 3.35TB/sec bandwidth on H100. This greatly boosts AI GPU performance, as Hopper H200 gets supercharged with the world's fastest AI memory: HBM3E. H200 is up to 45% faster in Llama 70B inference in MLPerf, setting a new world record. NVIDIA showed off the Intel Gaudi2 AI accelerator, which the Hopper H100 AI GPU demolishes, and then the beefed-up H200 AI GPU continues to skyrocket that same AI dominance. H100 provides 20,556 tokens per second in server-based performance and 21,806 in offline mode. Meanwhile, the new H200 dominates with 29,526 tokens per second on the server and a huge 31,712 tokens per second offline. This is a gigantic leap above what Intel Gaudi2 pumps out, with just 6287 and 8035 tokens per second for server and offline, respectively. Not only that, but NVIDIA's beast HGX H200 GPU system has 8 x H200 AI GPUs, demolishing the Stable Diffusion XL benchmark with 13.8 queries per second, and 13.7 samples per second in server and offline, respectively. NVIDIA's new Hopper H200 AI GPUs have 700W base TDP, with custom designs powering up to 1000W of power. NVIDIA's new Blackwell B100 is stock at 700W, while B200 AI GPUs come in 1200W and 1000W designs depending on the use.

"NVIDIA RTX 4060 drops to $279, lowest price ever - so, are you ready to buy the GPU yet?",2024-03-27T19:52:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97151/nvidia-rtx-4060-drops-to-279-lowest-price-ever-so-are-you-ready-buy-the-gpu-yet/index.html,"NVIDIA's RTX 4060 has a recommended price of $299, though it has sunk a bit below this before - although a fresh low has now been reached with its price tag in the US. Zotac's RTX 4060 Twin Edge OC in white is currently dropped down by the best part of 10% in price (Image Credit: Zotac) VideoCardz noticed that - at least at the time of writing - there's a Zotac RTX 4060 Twin Edge OC White Edition on sale for $279 at Newegg. Now, while that pricing may have been seen as part of local offers (in-store pick up) in the past, this is the first time that we're aware of that the vanilla RTX 4060 has sunk to $279 via an online listing you can just click and buy, there and then. That said, it's still not a massive discount, and we have seen deals close to this level in the past. Is it enough to tempt PC gamers into a purchase now? We're not sure. Some might argue to push for the RTX 4060 Ti, which has come down to the $330 mark in past sales (like Black Friday - for the 8GB version, of course), so that isn't too much more than the price we're seeing here for the RTX 4060. You'd have to wait, though, as the Ti variant isn't nearly that affordable currently. Further bear in mind that on the AMD side of the current-gen GPU market, you can get an RX 7600 for $250 (at the time of writing), a decent chunk less than this Zotac RTX 4060. But to be fair to NVIDIA (and Zotac), while performance for rasterization is not too far apart for these GPUs, the RTX 4060 does have additional benefits - better power efficiency, ray tracing performance, and the temptation of DLSS boosting your frame rates too. All in all, at $279, this RTX 4060 deal looks solid enough, even if a lot of PC gamers will still feel that the price of this NVIDIA GPU still needs to come down a bit to be more tempting. Could further falls in price be in the proverbial (graphics) cards? Well, here's where things get more interesting, as we've just heard a rumor that NVIDIA is running down stock of Lovelace graphics cards ahead of the launch of Blackwell GPUs later this year. If that's true - and granted, this is a bigger if than normal, even for the GPU grapevine - then odds are NVIDIA will be maintaining pricing on the Lovelace range for the most part. After all, if inventory levels are dropping, then it's difficult to imagine that we'll witness much further downward movement with the price tags of Team Green's graphics cards. We'll certainly be keeping a keen eye on pricing as we move forward into Q2 of this year. Meanwhile, the new cut-down spin on the RTX 3050 (6GB) is actually getting a price hike, believe or not - although admittedly not in the US.

How to update or uninstall a Game Ready driver,2024-04-05T11:30:59+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-update-or-uninstall-game-ready-drivers/,"Everyone will tell you that having the latest graphics drivers is important, and for most Nvidia GPU owners, that means Nvidia's GeForce Game Ready drivers. New driver releases can offer improved performance and stability, which is why it's crucial to know how to update them and turn a tedious task into a quick two-minute job. But what if something goes wrong with your latest driver? At that point, it's good to know how to uninstall it and start fresh with a new installation. Windows PC Nvidia graphics card You don't need to download any third-party tools to update or uninstall your Nvidia Game Ready drivers (although there's one tool that can be helpful). All you need is a Windows PC and a few minutes of your time. In this guide, we'll walk you through both processes so that driver updates for your graphics card will never be a hassle. Nvidia's GeForce Experience is the easiest way to update your Game Ready drivers. This is Nvidia's tool that lets you update drivers, optimize game settings, and even record your gameplay. However, keep in mind that you can't use it to roll back the drivers. We have a separate guide on that, so check it out if you don't want to update or uninstall and just want to go back to a previous version instead. Step 1: Start by downloading and installing Nvidia GeForce Experience. You can find it on Nvidia's website by clicking here. Follow the installation guide and make an account. Once installed, launch the tool; it should automatically detect your GPU. Step 2: Updating your drivers through GeForce Experience is straightforward. At the top-left corner, switch to the Drivers tab. You can then click on Check for updates and let the tool find drivers that match your GPU. Click on the three vertical dots next to Check for updates and make sure that you're using the Game Ready driver, not the Studio driver. We recommend Game Ready drivers for pretty much all users who don't need to use their GPU in professional, creative tasks. Finally, click on Download to get the driver. Step 3: Next, you can choose between an Express installation and a Custom installation. The difference is that the Custom option lets you pick whether you want just the graphics driver or any additional software and extra drivers from Nvidia, such as an audio driver. You can also choose to perform a clean installation during this process, which will remove any Nvidia profiles on your PC and restore all settings to their default state. For most users, we recommend the Express installation. Click on that, and the driver will begin installing. Windows may ask you for extra permissions, so tab into that to grant them. Don't worry if your screen turns off a few times during this process — it can happen. After a few minutes, you're all done — your driver is now up to date. If you don't want to use GeForce Experience to update your drivers, your other option is to just do it manually. It takes a little bit more time and is less streamlined, though. For starters, ...",1

This RTX-powered HP gaming laptop is a ludicrously low $700,2024-04-04T19:01:15+00:00,https://www.pcworld.com/article/2288333/this-rtx-powered-hp-gaming-laptop-is-a-ludicrously-low-700.html,"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Finding a gaming PC on a budget is a struggle — finding a gaming laptop on a budget, even more so. Today HP is closing out one model in its Victus sub-brand for $649.99, $350 off its regular price. While a 13th-gen Core i5 and an Nvidia RTX 3050 aren’t going to plow through the latest high-end games, it should be able to play the vast majority of titles at medium settings, and you almost never see a gaming laptop with discrete graphics going for this low of a price. The HP Victus 1550fa-100 (just rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it?) packs a 15.6-inch, 1080p display with an IPS panel, which won’t win any speed awards, but is more color-accurate than your usual gaming display. Other features include 512GB of SSD storage, full backlit keyboard with a number pad, and a roomy 70 watt-hour battery. Ports are generous, with two USB-A, one USB-C, full-sized HDMI for easy connection to an external display, and a full-sized SD card slot.  If this Victus laptop has an Achilles heel, it’s the 8GB of DDR4 RAM, which is pretty skimpy for anything running Windows 11. But based on a quick YouTube search, it looks like both SO-DIMM slots are open on the motherboard, so a few screws is all that separates you from a much-needed RAM upgrade. That’s an option that many laptops — even gaming laptops — no longer have.  I’d go with this $40 upgrade to 16GB, with the same generation and speed (3200MHz). Need some pointers? Here’s our guide on how to install laptop RAM.  HP is offering some customization options for the Victus before you order it — like the same RAM upgrade at double the price. If your budget can stretch a little, I’d recommend the $20 screen upgrade for a 144hz refresh option.

The latest Razer Blade 18 is now available to order,2024-04-04T18:03:30+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/the-latest-razer-blade-18-is-now-available-to-order-180330999.html?src=rss,"It’s taken Razer a few extra months to get its latest 18-inch Blade laptop ready for primetime after we first saw it at CES. Those who have been waiting for the company’s latest chonkster can now order the 2024 edition of the Razor Blade 18, which starts at $3,099. The base system comes with an i9-14900HX processor, 32GB of RAM, 1TB of SSD storage, Wi-Fi 7, a triple-fan cooling system and a six-speaker array with THX spatial audio support. On the GPU side, you can equip the laptop with up to an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 (the base model has a 4070 graphics card). In what Razer claims is a first for a laptop, there's Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, but only if you opt for a 4080 or 4090 GPU. The display is one of the big talking points for this laptop. It comes with a QHD+ 300Hz Mini-LED display as standard. If you want higher fidelity, you can opt for a 4K 200Hz screen. The company seems to have found an extra 35 hertz since CES, since it said at the time the Razer Blade 18 would have a 4K 165Hz display option. Razer claims that this display is a world first for a laptop and it’ll set you back an extra $1,700, far more than an equivalent standalone monitor would cost. You'll also need to wait until later this summer for a model with a 4K 200Hz panel to ship, whereas you can snag one with the QHD+ display now. We felt that last year's model was very expensive for a fully kitted-out configuration and that's the case again this time around. Still, if you need a big-screen, high-end laptop that can run just about any program or game you can throw at it, the latest Razer Blade 18 can be all yours if you have the cash to spare.

This Alienware gaming PC with an RTX 4080 is $300 off — for now,2024-04-04T15:13:27+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/alienware-aurora-r16-gaming-pc-deal-dell-april-2024/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? While you should be prepared to spend some serious cash if you want to buy a powerful machine from gaming PC deals, it’s important to be on the lookout for as much savings as possible. At $300 off from Dell, the Alienware Aurora R16 is a great example, as instead of $2,800, you’ll only have to pay $2,500. It’s still not what you’d call affordable, but you’ll at least have extra funds that you can spend on monitor deals, accessories, and video games. We’re not sure how much time is remaining on this discount though, so if you want to take advantage of it, it’s highly recommended that you push through with the purchase immediately.  The Alienware Aurora R16 is the latest model of the Dell-owned brand’s gaming desktops, and it currently reigns over our roundup of the best gaming PCs as an excellent choice for the everyday gamer. In terms of performance, it won’t have trouble running the best PC games at their most demanding settings with its 14th-generation Intel Core i9 processor, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super graphics card, and 32GB of RAM that’s the recommendation for gaming PCs by our guide on how much RAM do you need. You’ll be able to easily upgrade its components, but you won’t need to do that in the near future because with these specifications, you’ll be ready for the upcoming PC games of the next few years. The 1TB SSD of the Alienware Aurora R16 offers enough space to install several AAA titles, and you can do that right away because it ships with Windows 11 Home pre-loaded. If you’re planning to play for several hours at a time, you won’t have to worry about overheating because the gaming PC is equipped with a liquid-cooling system that will keep its temperature low. The Alienware Aurora R16 is a powerful gaming PC, which explains its expensive sticker price of $2,800. You can get it at $300 off from Dell right now though, which drops its price to a slightly more reasonable $2,500. It’s still a significant investment, but you might as well enjoy the discount while it’s there. However, because there’s always high demand for Alienware deals, we don’t expect this offer to stay online for a long time. If you think the Alienware Aurora R16 is the perfect gaming desktop for you, then you should proceed with the transaction as soon as possible.  A few years ago, buying a gaming laptop meant you had to spend thousands of dollars for a big and bulky thing that could barely play most video games for more than an hour.

TSMC to boost computer chip production in Arizona with $11.6 billion from CHIPS Act,2024-04-08T18:06:41+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/tsmc-to-boost-computer-chip-production-in-arizona-with-11-6-billion-in-federal-grants-loans/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 The US  government will dole out $11.6 billion in CHIPS Act funds to Taiwan Semiconductor in order to get the world’s largest chipmaker to boost its production of the critical technology in Arizona, the US Commerce Department said Monday. The Taiwanese company — which produces 90% of the world’s super-advanced semiconductors and supplies tech giant like Apple and Nvidia — agreed to build a third factory in Phoenix as part of a $65 billion investment at the production hub, officials said.  TSMC’s first two factories are under construction and expected to begin chip production in 2025 and 2028. It is the largest foreign direct investment in a brand-new development project in US history, according to the Commerce Department. “These are the chips that underpin all artificial intelligence, and they are the chips that are necessary components for the technologies that we need to underpin our economy, but frankly, a 21st century military and national security apparatus,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement. The package is tied to the bipartisan CHIPS Act – a sweeping law aimed at boosting domestic production of advanced computer chips amid fraying tensions with China. The $11.6 billion includes $6.6 billion in federal grants and up to $5 billion in low-cost loans. The agreement marks a major expansion of TSMC’s plans in Arizona. The company had previously committed to spending $40 billion to build out its production hub in the state. “The CHIPS and Science Act provides TSMC the opportunity to make this unprecedented investment and to offer our foundry service of the most advanced manufacturing technologies in the United States,” TSMC Chairman Mark Liu said in a statement. “Our US operations allow us to better support our US customers, which include several of the world’s leading technology companies. Our US operations will also expand our capability to trailblaze future advancements in semiconductor technology.” Apple CEO Tim Cook lauded the announcement, stating that the company was “proud to play a key part in the expansion of TSMC’s US production, and we’ll continue to invest in America and support a new era of American advanced manufacturing.”  Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said TSMC “has been a long-standing partner of Nvidia since we invented the GPU and accelerated computing, and our ongoing innovation in artificial intelligence would not have been possible without them.” TMSC is one of a handful of companies set to receive funding through the CHIPS Act. Samsung is reportedly set to double its investment on computer chip production in Taylor, Texas, to a whopping $44 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. Advertisement",2

Nvidia stock value up $1 trln in Q1,2024-04-08T13:39:04+00:00,https://www.financialmirror.com/2024/04/08/nvidia-stock-value-up-1-trln-in-q1/,"US chipmaker Nvidia continues breaking records after ending 2023 as the best S&P 500 performer, with a whopping 236% gain. The AI giant’s better-than-expected Q4 results helped add more than $400 bln to its stock value in just a month. However, the company’s three-month stock value growth is even more impressive. According to data presented by Stocklytics.com, Nvidia added more than one trillion dollars to its stock value in the first three months of the year, or 15% more than in the entire 2023. Ever since revealing how much it expects to profit from the rise of artificial intelligence last year, Nvidia has been at the frontline of the AI-fuelled stock market rally that has pushed the S&P 500 to historic highs. Each of the chipmaker’s earnings releases pushed its stock price further and further, helping it increase its stock value more than six times in less than a year and a half. In 2023 alone, the US chipmaker added almost $880 bln to its stock value, rising from $359 bln in January to over $1.1 trln in December. While this is quite an impressive gain, the company managed to outdo it in the first three months of 2024. Between January and March, Nvidia has added over one trillion dollars to its stock value, or $145 bln more than in the entire last year. Thanks to this recent gain, the market cap of the AI giant skyrocketed to $2.25 trln, showing a massive 529% increase since December 2022. Moreover, the 2024 stock price rally has brought Nvidia much bigger gains than any other AI giant achieved. In comparison, Meta added $350 bln to its stock value in the three months of the year, or three times less than Nvidia. Microsoft and Alphabet follow with $337 bln and $125 bln gains, respectively. Statistics show the three companies grew their stock values by a combined $812 bln in Q1, or nearly 20% less than Nvidia alone. The latest stock value growth has made Nvidia the third-largest tech company in the world by market cap, ahead of Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms and right behind the industry’s giants, Microsoft and Apple. However, if the US chipmaker continues growing its stock value at the pace seen in the first three months of the year, it could soon achieve something no other tech company could — dethrone Apple and become the world’s second-largest tech company. At present, Apple’s market cap amounted to $2.62 trln, or $366 bln more than Nvidia, a figure this company added to its market cap just a month after releasing the latest earnings report.

This Lenovo gaming laptop with an RTX 4060 is $430 off,2024-04-08T13:35:37+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/lenovo-legion-slim-5-gaming-laptop-deal-best-buy-april-2024/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? There are a lot of gaming laptop deals online, but not all of them will get you a dependable device for a reasonable price. To help you narrow down your options, here’s one of the best ones we’ve come across recently — the Lenovo Legion Slim 5 at $430 off from Best Buy, which brings its price down to $1,050 from $1,480 originally. We’re not sure how much time is remaining before this bargain gets taken down though, so if you think this is the perfect gaming laptop for you, proceed with the purchase right now so that you don’t miss out on the savings.  Lenovo is one of the best laptop brands and a mainstay in our roundup of the best gaming laptops, so you can be sure that you’ll be getting a topnotch gaming machine with the Lenovo Legion Slim 5. It’s got enough power to run the best PC games without any issues as it’s equipped with the AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 graphics card, combined with 16GB of RAM that’s the best place to start for gaming, according to our guide on how much RAM do you need. The gaming laptop also features a 1TB SSD with Windows 11 Home pre-installed. Another great reason for buying the Lenovo Legion Slim 5 gaming laptop is that it comes with a 14.5-inch OLED display with 2880 x 1800 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, which will give justice to the graphics of modern video games. You’ll be able to see even the smallest details, which may be the advantage that you need to get through boss fights and win multiplayer matches. Gamers who are looking for laptop deals shouldn’t settle for a machine that won’t meet their needs. You don’t need to break the bank when making your purchase because there are offers like Best Buy’s $430 discount for the Lenovo Legion Slim 5, which drops its price to a more affordable $1,050 from $1,480. It’s not the cheapest gaming laptop out there, but it will give you excellent value for your hard-earned money. You need to hurry in completing the transaction though, as the Lenovo Legion Slim 5 gaming laptop may return to its regular price as soon as tomorrow.  While you should be prepared to spend some serious cash if you want to buy a powerful machine from gaming PC deals, it's important to be on the lookout for as much savings as possible. At $300 off from Dell, the Alienware Aurora R16 is a great example, as instead of $2,800, you'll only have to pay $2,500. It's still not what you'd call affordable, but you'll at least have extra funds that you can spend on monitor deals, accessories, and video games. We're not sure how much time is remaining on this discount though, so if you want to take advantage of it, it's highly recommended that you push through with the purchase immediately. Why you should buy the Alienware Aurora R16 gaming PC
The Alienware Aurora R16 is the latest model of the Dell-owned brand's gaming desktops, and it currently reigns over our roundup of the best gaming...",2
"Weekly AI Bubble Watch: AMD, Nvidia, SMCI Fall",2024-04-08T12:56:00+00:00,http://www.baystreet.ca/articles/stockstowatch.aspx?id=17602," The S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq’s (QQQ) weak performance last week will worry investors holding AI-related stocks. Valuations are wildly stretched for AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), and Super Computer Micro (SMCI). Markets justify their rise on expectations that growth will accelerate this year. Assuming the market does not suddenly panic about valuations, all three stocks should fall only slightly from here. AMD has the most bearish momentum today. The stock peaked at over $220 before falling heavily intraday on March 8. Since then, the stock fell sharply, closing at $170.42. Investors prefer to hold Nvidia, whose leadership in the desktop gaming GPU and server AI markets is more appealing. Nvidia has some technical risks on the chart, which indicates a “double top” at $950. NVDA stock closed at $880.08. SMCI’s downtrend is not a concern yet. Trading volume is falling as shares fall. Still, JP Morgan’s upgrade on March 25 is late, after the stock is already up. The firm cites market leadership, market share growth, custom build demand, and the strong AI server market as reasons to buy SMCI stock. Your Takeaway Be wary of companies citing AI in their conference call to try to attract investors. AI investments must increase operating efficiency and improve service quality. Otherwise, this is a fad that does not pay off for those investing in AI solutions. Copyright 1998 - 2024 Baystreet.ca Media Corp. All rights reserved. Nasdaq Stocks: Information delayed 15 minutes.
