Trump legal news brief: Appeals court denies Trump request for review of immunity claim in Carroll defamation suit,2024-01-08T23:40:35+00:00,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-legal-news-brief-appeals-court-denies-trump-request-for-review-of-immunity-claim-in-carroll-defamation-suit-234035009.html," Following Colorado, Maine and other states, Oregon is forced to decide whether, under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, former President Donald Trump is disqualified from appearing on its 2024 ballot for engaging in insurrection — and chooses to wait until a pending U.S. Supreme Court case on the same subject is resolved. In New York, a judge ordered Trump to pay the New York Times nearly $400,000 in compensation for the legal fees it incurred while fighting his failed 2021 lawsuit against the paper. Here are the latest legal developments in the cases facing the man who hopes to return to the White House. Oregon Supreme Court declines to hear case challenging Trump’s eligibility for the 2024 ballot Key players: Oregon Supreme Court, U.S. Supreme Court, Oregon Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade Previously, a group of voters had asked LaVonne Griffin-Valade, a Democrat, to remove Trump from the ballot. She declined, claiming that she did not have the authority under Oregon law to consider Trump's qualifications during a primary. The same group then filed a lawsuit at the Oregon Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would issue a quick decision on whether the 14th Amendment could be used to keep Trump off of presidential ballots. In response, the Oregon court decided to hit pause “because a decision by the United States Supreme Court ... may resolve one or more contentions ... in the Oregon proceeding.” The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on the matter on Feb. 8; Oregon’s presidential primary ballots must be finalized by March 21. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution forbids any person who had “previously taken an oath” and was later found to have “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” from holding office. So far, Colorado and Maine have removed Trump from their GOP primary ballots, but those decisions have been paused to allow for appeals. Other states — including Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona and California — have chosen to keep Trump on their primary ballots. Why it matters: The recent flurry of 14th Amendment rulings on Trump’s 2024 ballot eligibility will likely subside now as states wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in early next month. A clear decision against Trump — considered a long shot, given the court’s conservative majority — would upend the election; a clear decision in his favor would bring accusations of political bias. The other possibility — a narrow, technical decision or one that postpones addressing the central issue — could keep the controversy alive through November.

Trump moves to dismiss Georgia election case,2024-01-08T22:50:42+00:00,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67916669?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,"Donald Trump has asked a Georgia judge to throw out the election fraud case against him, arguing that he is protected by presidential immunity.  Mr Trump is among 19 people charged with a conspiracy to overturn the state's 2020 election results. But his lawyers said ""no President ever faced criminal prosecution for acts committed while in office"". If the judge accepts the claim, it would mark a massive expansion of the president's powers of immunity. ""From 1789 to 2023, no President ever faced criminal prosecution for acts committed while in office,"" Mr Trump's lawyers wrote in the Monday filing. ""That unbroken historic tradition of presidential immunity is rooted in the separation of powers and the text of the Constitution."" On Tuesday, a federal appeals court hearing in DC heard arguments over the same presidential immunity claims as Mr Trump tries to throw out a separate election interference case brought forward by special counsel Jack Smith.   Mr Trump attended the hearing before the three-judge panel. The former president has for years cited presidential immunity in his efforts to thwart civil and criminal cases brought against him.  But this defence was already ""convincingly and comprehensively"" rejected by US District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan in December, University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias told the BBC.  Ms Chutkan wrote that the presidency does not ""confer a lifelong 'get-out-of-jail-free' pass"" on past holders of the office.  Mr Trump's lawyers also argued the Georgia criminal case should be tossed out on grounds of double jeopardy - that he was already tried and acquitted on similar charges in the US Senate following the Capitol riot in 2021.  Finally, in a separate motion, Mr Trump's lawyers argued that the case violates his due process and First Amendment rights. ""President Trump did not have fair warning that his alleged conduct, pure political speech and expressive conduct challenging an election, could be criminalized,"" the filing says.  Georgia's Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis brought the charges against Mr Trump and 18 others last year, in a 41-count indictment for alleged attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state. Mr Trump was charged with 13 criminal counts including an alleged violation of Georgia's Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (Rico). His other charges include solicitation of violation of oath by a public officer, conspiring to commit impersonating a public officer, conspiring to commit forgery, conspiring to commit false statements, and writing and conspiring to file false documents. On Monday, a motion brought on behalf of Michael Roman, one of the co-defendants in the Georgia case, alleged there was an ""improper"" romantic relationship between Ms Willis and one of the lead prosecutors working the case. The motion included no concrete proof of the allegations, which were based on an anonymous source. Mr Roman's legal team is seeking to get his charges dismi...",0

"Donald Trump tries to quash Georgia indictment, citing executive immunity",2024-01-08T21:17:35+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/01/08/news/donald-trump-tries-to-quash-fulton-county-indictment/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Former President Donald Trump is taking his presidential immunity ploy south in a bid to get his 13-count indictment on charges of trying to unlawfully reverse Georgia’s 2020 election results tossed. In a trio of filings Monday, which largely mirror arguments Trump’s attorneys used against special counsel Jack Smith, the 77-year-old’s team contended that his actions concerning the election derived from his official duties.  “The indictment is barred by presidential immunity and should be dismissed with prejudice,” his attorneys wrote. “The President is immune from criminal prosecution for official acts.” Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis launched a sprawling racketeering case against Trump and 18 of his allies and supporters last August, alleging they conspired to try to manipulate the election outcome in the Peach State.  Four of the defendants have since pleaded guilty and promised to cooperate with prosecutors. Willis’ investigation of Trump was triggered by a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which Trump emphasized the need to “find uh 11,780 votes.” “Communicating with state officials about the administration of a federal election and urging them to exercise their official responsibilities with respect to that election are also core exercises of presidential responsibility,” Trump’s legal team wrote.  “So too [is] urging the Vice President and Members of Congress to exercise their official responsibilities consistent with the President’s view of the public good is authorized by the Constitution and lies at the heart of the President’s constitutional and historic role.” Prosecutors have contended that Trump was not on an altruistic mission as president to safeguard the election but was rather scheming to reverse his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.  Trump’s team made a similar pitch to US District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the federal case brought against the former president on similar charges. Last month, Chutkan rejected the presidential immunity theory, quipping that Trump wasn’t entitled to a “lifelong get-out-of-jail-free pass.” His team then appealed that ruling to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which is set to hold oral arguments on the matter Tuesday.  In tandem with the immunity claim, Trump’s attorneys also argued that the 13-count indictment should be quashed because of his acquittal during his second impeachment for allegedly inciting an insurrection. They contended that prosecuting him over the election amounts to double jeopardy — the same argument they have presented to the federal appeals court. Trump confirmed Monday that he plans to appear for the DC hearing, which will take place before a three-judge panel.  “If I don’t get Immunity, then Crooked Joe Biden doesn’t get Immunity, and with the Border Invasion and Afghanistan Surrender, alone, not to mention the Millions of dollars that went into hi...",0
"Experts break down what the Constitution, framers said about 'presidential immunity'",2024-01-08T21:01:02+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/experts-break-constitution-framers-presidential-immunity/story?id=106140371,"Donald Trump's ""absolute immunity"" claim will be tested in court Tuesday. It's a key question in a case that could not only set constitutional precedent but also have major consequences in the 2024 election: What is ""presidential immunity"" and how, if at all, does it apply to former President Donald Trump regarding his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss? On Tuesday, Trump's claim of ""absolute immunity"" from prosecution in his federal election inference case will be put to the test in arguments before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The former president, who denies all wrongdoing, contends his actions after the election and on Jan. 6, 2021, were related not to his role as a candidate but to his official constitutional duty to ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed"" -- in this case to investigate alleged but unproven election fraud. Because of that, he argues, he's protected from criminal liability. He points as well to his being acquitted in his Senate impeachment trial on charges of ""incitement of insurrection"" as another shield from litigation. Special counsel Jack Smith asserts Trump ""is wrong"" and that his arguments ""threaten to undermine democracy.""  The case, which is likely to wind up back before the U.S. Supreme Court, will chart new legal ground, experts told ABC News as they broke down the history and precedent of ""presidential immunity."" ""These are novel issues and they're going to have to create new law,"" said attorney Stanley Brand, a former House of Representatives general counsel whose law firm represents several former Trump aides. Trump has posted on social media that he will attend the Jan. 9 hearing. In the post, he also continued his claim that he was ""entitled"" as president to immunity, arguing he was no longer campaigning but ""looking for voter fraud ... and otherwise running our country."" Here's what you need to know. David Schultz, a professor at the University of Minnesota and national expert in constitutional law, said there is ""nothing in the text of the Constitution that speaks to immunity in one way or another."" But there is textual evidence from the Constitution's framers -- including Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton -- about how they viewed the issue. ""We have language from some framers indicating that even if there might have been some immunity while a person was president of the United States, once they've left office there's no immunity and they could be charged with the crime,"" Schultz said. Such statements were used in a 2000 Department of Justice memo that found the Constitution permits a former president to be indicted and tried for the same offenses for which they were acquitted in an impeachment trial, Schultz noted. Smith's team, in its brief to the appeals court, also cited the nation's founders. They wrote Trump's immunity claim would essentially allow presidents to act criminally to remain in office, something ""the Founders did not intend and would...",0
Trump seeks to dismiss his criminal case in Georgia by appealing to his ‘immunity’,2024-01-08T21:00:02+00:00,https://www.laprensalatina.com/trump-seeks-to-dismiss-his-criminal-case-in-georgia-by-appealing-to-his-immunity/,"Washington, Jan 8 (EFE).- Former US President Donald Trump (2017-2021) sent a petition on Monday to dismiss his criminal case in the State of Georgia, appealing that he had immunity at the time of the events. It is an argument very similar to the one his defense used in the criminal case in Washington. A hearing is scheduled for this Tuesday before a federal appeals court, considering whether to admit this plea. The two court cases concern Trump’s efforts to interfere in the 2020 White House election results, which he lost to current President Joe Biden, a Democrat. “The indictment in this case charges President Trump for acts that lie at the heart of his official responsibilities as President. The indictment is barred by presidential immunity and should be dismissed with prejudice,” the lawyers said in the filing with the Georgia state court. The defense strategy is the same the lawyers have insisted on from the beginning, that Trump’s actions fall within his duties as US president. In Georgia, Trump is accused, along with 18 accomplices, of forming a criminal association to change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in that state. The surprising racketeering charge is the same one that has been used in the past to prosecute mafia organizations. Prosecutors aim to bring Trump to trial in August 2024, just three months before the new presidential election. At the heart of the case is a call Trump made to Georgia’s top election official, Brad Raffensperger, days after the 2020 presidential election, asking him to “find 11,780 votes” that would have taken the state from Biden. A call that Raffensperger recorded and then leaked. In addition to the pressure on Raffensperger, prosecutors accuse Trump and his accomplices of trying to persuade Georgia lawmakers to ignore the popular will expressed at the ballot box and of harassing a poll worker. The former US president could potentially face a maximum sentence of 76 and a half years in prison. Legal outcomes, however, depend on various factors and court decisions. EFE at/dgp",0

Is Trump ‘immune’ from prosecution?

Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in Three-judge panel in Washington DC will hear arguments from prosecutors and Trump’s legal team  Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Donald Trump’s legal team will try to convince a federal appeals court that the former president should be immune from criminal prosecution for his attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. His defence was already shot down by the judge overseeing the election conspiracy case against him. On Tuesday, a three-judge panel in Washington DC will hear arguments from the former president’s attorneys who want that decision reversed. Mr Trump and his attorneys have argued that his alleged criminal actions on trial were part of his “official acts” as president. The federal investigation into the efforts of Mr Trump and his allies to subvert the outcome of the election are detailed in a 45-page indictment outlining three alleged criminal conspiracies and the obstruction of Joe Biden’s victory, culminating in a mob’s violent breach of the US Capitol in a last-ditch riot to stop it. A grand jury voted to indict Mr Trump last August after months of evidence and witness testimony under an investigation helmed by special counsel Jack Smith. A trial date is tentatively set for 4 March. Mr Trump’s appeals and mounting court battles in the middle of the 2024 presidential race have threatened to steer that timeline off course. On 1 December, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Mr Trump’s motion to have the case dismissed on immunity and constitutional grounds. Judge Chutkan, who is overseeing the election conspiracy case, wrote that his “four-year service as Commander in Chief did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens.” The office “does not confer a lifelong ‘get-out-of-jail-free’ pass,” she wrote in a 48-page ruling, Former presidents enjoy no special consideration after leaving office and are “subject to federal investigation, indictment, prosecution, conviction, and punishment for any criminal acts undertaken while in office,” according to Judge Chutkan. “Granting the immunity Defendant seeks would also break with longstanding legal precedent that all government officials – even those immune from civil claims – may be held to criminal account,” she added. She also dismissed Mr Trump’s First Amendment defence, arguing that broad speech protections do not include speech “that is used as an instrument of a crime.” Prosecutors argue that Mr Trump relied on knowingly false claims about the election to pressure state officials to approve fraudulent slates of electors to obstruct the certification of the results, then attempted to persuade then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse the outcome, and, ultimately, failed to dissua...",0

Trump warned there will be 'little tolerance' for his 'shenanigans' at immunity hearing,2024-01-08T20:20:40+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/trump/trump-2666901723/,"Responding to a blustery announcement from Donald Trump that he will be making an appearance at the U.S. Court of Appeals for a Tuesday hearing on his presidential immunity appeal, one former prosecutor warned the former president that he is on thin ice. Just after midnight Monday, Trump took to his Truth Social platform to announce, ""I will be attending the the (sic) Federal Appeals Court Arguments on Presidential Immunity in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday. Of course I was entitled, as President of the United States and Commander in Chief, to Immunity. I wasn’t campaigning, the Election was long over. I was looking for voter fraud, and finding it, which is my obligation to do, and otherwise running running (sic) our Country."" Noting that the former president has been making a habit of holding impromptu press conferences outside Judge Arthur Engoron's courtroom to complain about being held accountable for committing financial fraud, former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance alerted the former president those kinds of antics won't play well with the appeals court justices. Added to that, she stated reports that Judge Tanya Chutkan was victimized with a swatting on Sunday night will surely set the stage for zero tolerance by the judges. Taking to X, Vance wrote, ""Courts of Appeals tend to frown on litigants holding press conferences on the courthouse steps. Especially if reports that trial Judge Tanya Chutkan was swatted last night are true, expect little tolerance for Trump shenanigans.""   So do we.

University of Hawaiʻi: Where are all our island people in the ocean sciences?,2024-01-08T20:17:23+00:00,https://mauinow.com/2024/01/08/university-of-hawai%ca%bbi-where-are-all-our-island-people-in-the-ocean-sciences/,"Privacy Policy | About Our Ads University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa faculty, students and alumni asked the question: “Where are all our island people in the ocean sciences?” “As descendants of the ocean, the dearth of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in ocean science seems inconsonant,” writes a team of authors in an article published in a special issue of Oceanography called  “Building Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Ocean Sciences.” Article co-author Rosie Alegado, associate professor in the UH Mānoa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology, said to understand the root causes of this disparity and potential solutions, UH faculty, staff and students approached this problem through the lens of voyagers. They examined the past course of history of the peoples of the Pacific and attempted to make headwinds in programs focused on increasing participation in ocean sciences. The article highlights programs at UH that are aimed at improving pathways for Native Hawaiians in the geosciences, including summer bridge programs, internships and other professional development programs.  In better defining the persistent, systemic and collective barriers that Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders face within western society and the academy, the authors identify gaps that conventional professional development programs aimed at minoritized groups in the geosciences have been unsuccessful in filling.  “Native Hawaiians are often overlooked in the development and leadership of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander-serving programs,” said lead author Haunani Kane, an assistant professor at the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology. “Programs led by Native Hawaiian scientists and community members ensure that they are culturally centered safe spaces for students to collectively grow their identities as both Native Hawaiians and scientists.” The SOEST Maile Mentoring Bridge program and the Hilo-based Multiscale Environmental Graphical Analysis Lab (MEGA Lab) are examples of successful programs with Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander scientist leadership. Maile was founded in 2013 with the goal of attracting and retaining more minorities into geoscience degree programs and careers.  “Looking back on the last 10 years of my life, the Maile Mentoring program has made such a huge impact,” said Maile co-director Diamond Tachera, who also was a co-author of the article. “As an undergraduate student, it was so important for me to see people, especially wāhine (women), who looked like me working and thriving in their scientific fields.” To overcome traditional barriers related to retention of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders in the ocean sciences, the MEGA Lab, a predominantly Native Hawaiian-led lab and nonprofit, developed a research program that prioritizes inclusive research experiences. The MEGA Lab assembled a Native Hawaiian research team to embark on a 15-day voyage to Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.  “That trip inspired...",0

At the National Science Foundation (NSF), artificial intelligence has become a high priority agenda item. Recently, it appointed a new special assistant to the director to focus on AI.  The Federal Drive with Tom Temin  spoke with the new NSF AI Director, Tess deBlanc-Knowles. Interview Transcript:  Tom Temin All right, so tell us what this job is all about. You have another job already at NSF, and we’ll get into that. But now, your special assistant to the director for artificial intelligence. That sounds like AI matters a lot around there. Tess deBlanc-Knowles It does. Yeah. And I think it’s important to start out with the point that NSF has long played a really significant role in sustaining AI research in the United States. NSF investments were instrumental in the development of machine learning, reinforcement learning approaches that are really at the core of today’s large language models. And today, NSF support for the field totals more than $800 million annually. And this funds innovation activities across 50 states, D.C., Puerto Rico. There’s support for things like research projects, institutes, fellowships and traineeship opportunities, education and research infrastructure. And we support the whole pipeline of innovation. So from foundational discoveries to the applied work of applying AI to other fields like agriculture, education, climate issues. And we also support the really critical work to advance trustworthy AI. And that it’s really important as increasingly, AI products are coming to market, there’s still a lot of work that needs to be done in the research space to advance the verifiability and reliability of AI systems. And then we also support researchers as they move their ideas to market, kind of along that full pipeline of translation, in terms of developing the idea, the business plan and then supporting startups. And then our programs also support some of these foundational elements that are critical for AI innovation ecosystem. So we play a pivotal role in supporting education and training, from k-through-12 education to making experiential learning opportunities available to advance education. And then we facilitate access to the research infrastructure. And really do this all at a really national scale, making sure that those opportunities are available for all Americans. So my role in this is focused on facilitating coordination across these many AI initiatives that we have underway, and then also ensuring timely implementation of NSF task in the recent AI executive order released by the administration. And it used to be the case that our AI funding was almost all focused through our Computer Science and Engineering direc...",0

Trump says he'll attend immunity hearing Tuesday in his Jan. 6 case,2024-01-08T17:55:32+00:00,https://abcnews.go.com/US/trump-hell-attend-immunity-hearing-tuesday-jan-6/story?id=106193594,"The hearing comes two days before he's expected to attend his civil fraud trial. Former President Donald Trump says he'll be in court Tuesday when the Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals hears arguments over his efforts to dismiss his federal election interference case based on his claim of presidential immunity. It could mark the first of two court appearances Trump makes this week, as he's also expected to attend closing arguments in his civil fraud trial in New York on Thursday. Trump is seeking the dismissal of the federal election interference case on the grounds that he has ""absolute immunity"" from prosecution for actions taken while serving in the nation's highest office.  The former president confirmed his plans to attend Tuesday's hearing in a social media post early Monday morning. ""I will be attending the the Federal Appeals Court Arguments on Presidential Immunity in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday,"" he wrote. ""Of course I was entitled, as President of the United States and Commander in Chief, to Immunity. I wasn't campaigning, the Election was long over. I was looking for voter fraud."" Last month, special counsel Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to step in and quickly rule on the issue, but the court declined to grant a writ of certiorari before judgment -- meaning it would allow a federal appeals court to hear the matter first, which is what Trump's legal team had urged the court to do. ""This case involves -- for the first time in our Nation's history -- criminal charges against a former President based on his actions while in office,"" Smith's team said in their petition to the Supreme Court to expediate the appeals process. ""And not just any actions: alleged acts to perpetuate himself in power by frustrating the constitutionally prescribed process for certifying the lawful winner of an election."" ""The Nation has a compelling interest in a decision on respondent's claim of immunity from these charges -- and if they are to be tried, a resolution by conviction or acquittal, without undue delay,"" Smith's filing said. Trump in August pleaded not guilty to charges of undertaking a ""criminal scheme"" to overturn the results of the 2020 election by enlisting a slate of so-called ""fake electors,"" using the Justice Department to conduct ""sham election crime investigations,"" trying to enlist the vice president to ""alter the election results,"" and promoting false claims of a stolen election as the Jan. 6 riot raged -- all in an effort to subvert democracy and remain in power.

Trump demands Georgia drop prosecution as he threatens to indict Biden amid 'immunity' claim,2024-01-08T17:51:21+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/news-politics/trump-biden-2666898455/,"Donald Trump is being criticized after filing a motion demanding Georgia must drop its RICO case against him, claiming he has presidential immunity, while just hours earlier threatening to indict President Joe Biden if the federal courts do not grant him that protection from prosecution. Focusing on his claim of presidential immunity, on Monday Trump’s attorneys filed a motion (below) demanding Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis drop her racketeering and election subversion case against the ex-president, who is facing 13 charges in the Georgia case. Trump’s attorneys are also claiming the Georgia prosecution violates “double jeopardy” rules, because the U.S. Senate did not convict him when he was impeached for his actions surrounding the January 6 insurrection. Overnight, Trump announced he will attend Tuesday’s D.C. federal appeals court hearing on his claim of presidential immunity in Special Counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution for election subversion, where he faces four felony charges including engaging in a conspiracy to defraud the government, and to disenfranchise voters. “The indictment in this case charges President Trump for acts that lie at the heart of his official responsibilities as President,” Trump’s attorneys claimed to Georgia Judge Scott McAfee on Monday, as CNN reports. “The indictment is barred by presidential immunity and should be dismissed with prejudice.” READ MORE: ‘I Won the Election and He Was the Loser’: Biden, Showing Anger and Passion, Torches Trump At 12:38 AM Monday morning, Trump posted a lengthy screed to his Truth Social website, claiming not his innocence, but that he is entitled to “Immunity.” “I wasn’t campaigning, the Election was long over,” when he allegedly engaged in election subversion efforts, including those surrounding the January 6 insurrection. “I was looking for voter fraud, and finding it, which is my obligation to do, and otherwise running running our Country,” he added. Some have noted it is not the job of the President of the United States to be “looking for election fraud,” as elections are run by the states, not the federal government. Also, the U.S. DOJ, not the President, would have jurisdiction over voter disenfranchisement. “If I don’t get Immunity, then Crooked Joe Biden doesn’t get Immunity,” Trump added, threatening the current, sitting President, before making unproven allegations against Biden. “Joe would be ripe for Indictment. By weaponizing the DOJ against his Political Opponent, ME, Joe has opened a giant Pandora’s Box,” Trump concluded, falsely. Responding to his Truth Social claims, professor of law and former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance wrote, “Courts of Appeals tend to frown on litigants holding press conferences on the courthouse steps. Especially if reports that trial Judge Tanya Chutkan was swatted last night are true, expect little tolerance for Trump shenanigans.” READ MORE: DeSantis Frames Same-Sex Marriage Supporters as Threat ‘Against Our Religious Institutions’...",0
"Trump legal news brief: In Georgia, Trump again bets presidential immunity will spare him from prosecution",2024-01-08T17:45:55+00:00,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-legal-news-brief-in-georgia-trump-again-bets-presidential-immunity-will-spare-him-from-prosecution-174555314.html," Following Colorado, Maine and other states, Oregon is forced to decide whether, under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, former President Donald Trump is disqualified from appearing on its 2024 ballot for engaging in insurrection — and chooses to wait until a pending U.S. Supreme Court case on the same subject is resolved. In New York, a judge ordered Trump to pay the New York Times nearly $400,000 in compensation for the legal fees it incurred while fighting his failed 2021 lawsuit against the paper. Here are the latest legal developments in the cases facing the man who hopes to return to the White House. Oregon Supreme Court declines to hear case challenging Trump’s eligibility for the 2024 ballot Key players: Oregon Supreme Court, U.S. Supreme Court, Oregon Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade Previously, a group of voters had asked LaVonne Griffin-Valade, a Democrat, to remove Trump from the ballot. She declined, claiming that she did not have the authority under Oregon law to consider Trump's qualifications during a primary. The same group then filed a lawsuit at the Oregon Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would issue a quick decision on whether the 14th Amendment could be used to keep Trump off of presidential ballots. In response, the Oregon court decided to hit pause “because a decision by the United States Supreme Court ... may resolve one or more contentions ... in the Oregon proceeding.” The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on the matter on Feb. 8; Oregon’s presidential primary ballots must be finalized by March 21. Section 3 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution forbids any person who had “previously taken an oath” and was later found to have “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” from holding office. So far, Colorado and Maine have removed Trump from their GOP primary ballots, but those decisions have been paused to allow for appeals. Other states — including Minnesota, Michigan, Arizona and California — have chosen to keep Trump on their primary ballots. Why it matters: The recent flurry of 14th Amendment rulings on Trump’s 2024 ballot eligibility will likely subside now as states wait for the Supreme Court to weigh in early next month. A clear decision against Trump — considered a long shot, given the court’s conservative majority — would upend the election; a clear decision in his favor would bring accusations of political bias. The other possibility — a narrow, technical decision or one that postpones addressing the central issue — could keep the controversy alive through November.

"I’m a dietitian — fight the flu, colds with these 10 immune-boosting recipes",2024-01-08T17:45:17+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/01/08/lifestyle/fight-cold-and-flu-with-10-immune-boosting-recipes-from-a-dietitian/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 With flu season in full swing — and other seasonal respiratory infections also spiking across the U.S. — experts say it’s important to keep your immune system strong and healthy during this time of year.  One way to combat seasonal illness is to regularly consume key nutrients and proteins that help improve immune health, according to Amy Goodson, a registered dietitian and sports nutrition consultant in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. “The overall importance of nutritious foods in boosting immunity cannot be overstated, as the intricate relationship between diet and the immune system profoundly influences the body’s ability to defend against infections and maintain optimal health,” Goodson, who is also the author of “The Sports Nutrition Playbook,” told Fox News Digital. “A well-balanced and diverse diet provides essential nutrients that play key roles in supporting various immune functions.” Goodson recommended the following seven recipes that contain key ingredients to ward off winter illness. “Beef is a top source of zinc, which plays a key role in immune function,” Goodson said.  “Just 3 ounces of beef provides 53% of the recommended daily value of zinc.” Beef is also a high-quality protein source that can help boost immunity, she said. The broccoli in this recipe includes beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant known to help decrease inflammation and increase immune function.  The bell peppers, rich in vitamin C, can help stimulate white blood cell activity to strengthen immune defense.  Ingredients: Lean beef strips, broccoli, bell peppers, soy sauce, ginger, garlic Instructions: Stir-fry beef and vegetables in soy sauce, ginger and garlic until cooked. Mushrooms contain selenium, a nutrient essential for the proper functioning of the immune system, Goodson noted.  It also has antioxidant properties. Ingredients: Bell peppers, mushrooms, quinoa, black beans, onion, garlic, cumin, paprika, tomato sauce, cheese Instructions: Cook quinoa. Sauté mushrooms, onion and garlic. Mix with cooked quinoa, black beans, cumin and paprika.  Stuff the peppers, top with tomato sauce and cheese. Bake until cheese is melted. “Curcumin, found in turmeric, has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, supporting immune health,” said Goodson. Ingredients: Milk, turmeric, ginger, cinnamon, honey Instructions: Heat milk, add turmeric, ginger and cinnamon. Whisk until well mixed. Sweeten with honey. A salad containing citrus fruits is high in vitamin C, which supports the production of white blood cells, essential for fighting infections and viruses, according to Goodson. Ingredients: Oranges, grapefruits, kiwi, pomegranate seeds, mint leaves Instructions: Mix citrus fruits, top with pomegranate seeds, garnish with mint leaves. The probiotics in yogurt promote a healthy gut microbiome, positively impacting immune function, the dietitian told Fox News Digital. Ingredients: Greek yogurt, mixed berries, granola...",0

"Trump wants Georgia election subversion case dismissed, arguing he has presidential immunity",2024-01-08T17:14:21+00:00,https://kion546.com/news/2024/01/08/trump-wants-georgia-election-subversion-case-dismissed-arguing-he-has-presidential-immunity-2/,"Originally Published: 08 JAN 24 10:44 ET Updated: 08 JAN 24 11:44 ET By Zachary Cohen, Katelyn Polantz, Jason Morris and Nick Valencia, CNN (CNN) — Former President Donald Trump is seeking to have the sweeping criminal conspiracy case against him in Georgia thrown out by arguing he is protected from prosecution under presidential immunity. Trump’s immunity claims in the Georgia case, filed on Monday as part of a motion to dismiss state-level criminal charges against the former president, are similar to those argued by his defense team in the federal election subversion case. “The indictment in this case charges President Trump for acts that lie at the heart of his official responsibilities as President. The indictment is barred by presidential immunity and should be dismissed with prejudice,” the motion filed by Trump’s lawyer in the Georgia case reads. Monday’s filing in the Georgia case reiterates what the former president’s lawyers have repeatedly asserted – that Trump was working in his official capacity as president when he allegedly undermined the 2020 election results and therefore has immunity. Trump’s attorney argues that the specific acts in Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis’ indictment “lie squarely within the ‘outer perimeter’ of the President’s official duties.” This includes Trump’s public statements about the administration of the 2020 election, communicating with the Justice Department about investigations related to the election and “urging the Vice President and Members of Congress to exercise their official responsibilities consistent with the President’s view of the public good.” “Organizing slates of electors in furtherance of that effort to have Congress exercise its responsibilities falls within the President’s official duties as well,” Trump’s lawyer argues. As such, Trump’s indictment in both the Georgia and federal case are unconstitutional because presidents cannot be criminally prosecuted for “official acts” unless they are impeached and convicted by the US Senate. On Tuesday, the DC US Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments by attorneys for Trump and special counsel Jack Smith over the same two claims of immunity, a hearing Trump himself is set to attend. Monday is the deadline for pre-trial motions to be filed in the sprawling Georgia racketeering case against Trump and the remaining co-defendants accused of helping the former president try to overturn the 2020’s election results in the state. Fulton County prosecutors said they want the trial to begin in early August 2024, which could potentially be directly in the middle of Trump’s presidential election campaign if he wins the Republican nomination. Trump’s legal team is invoking the supremacy clause of the US Constitution to try to shield him from criminal prosecution in Georgia. In court filings, Trump’s team argues the state-level justice system can’t interfere with federal duties. This argument, if successful, could further expand the protection...",0

I’m not saying that there's anything wrong with a comfy sweats ‘fit, but from personal experience when I take the time and effort to get dressed in an outfit that makes me feel cute, my mood is instantly raised tenfold. MORE: Stripey scarves are in for 2024 - Here are 10 you can shop right now RELATED: 5 Fashion New Year's Resolutions for 2024 that are actually achievable It kind of goes without saying, but how you style your clothes (whether it’s consciously or subconsciously) reflects who you are as a person and expresses your individuality. Maybe you’re a colour lover who feels bright colours brighten their mood or perhaps you’re a neutral stan who loves subtle colour palettes to calm their busy life. Whatever the gravitational pull might be, there’s a reason why your wardrobe influences your mood.  When you think about it, dressing for your mood is a subconscious reaction that we often don’t think twice about. When you’re sick all you feel like wearing is your favourite pyjamas and when the reservation for that fancy dinner you booked months ago comes around you want to go all out in your best glad rags. In an interview conducted by Fashion Journal Fashion Psychologist Michelle Pal explains that the link between dopamine dressing and our mood is most definitely connected. Michelle says in the interview “Our self-care or little habits, like dressing up or putting on makeup, tend to be one of the first things to drop off when feeling stressed or depressed.” continuing on to say “Different colours can have different effects on the brain. For example, red tends to be the most stimulating colour and has been found to improve performance on detail-oriented tasks.”  It also seems the statement “dress for the job you want” has some truth to it, as Michelle also explained that “Studies show that when given a doctor’s lab coat to wear, people will perform better on attention-related tasks; people who wear suits tend to feel more powerful and be better negotiators; and when someone wears athletic wear they are more likely to exercise.”  So whether you’re looking to fight the winter blues or take control of your life, your first step might be easier and more obtainable than you thought.

"Science discovers secret of dieting, in pigs",2024-01-08T16:57:34+00:00,https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/science/2024-01-08/ty-article-magazine/science-discovers-secret-of-dieting-in-pigs/0000018c-e9d8-d249-a1ce-efdd11220000,"Miniaturized motor inside a capsule that fools the stomach into thinking it's full leads pigs to eat less, small but intriguing study shows Dieting is a quagmire. Keto works for some people. Others swear by grapefruit and seaweed or some other trendy lo-cal combo. Intermittent fasting is all the rage but hasn't actually been shown to work. The prescription to eat less and exercise more in order to lose weight is often unwelcome. Surgery is costly and painful, and you still need self-control.  New drugs purporting to combat obesity such as Ozempic and Wegovy, meanwhile, come with an impressive array of potential side effects.  There are no easy answers, but now science brings fresh hope to the obese – if they are pigs. Administering a motorized vibrating capsule to six pigs before meals reduced consumption levels by about 40 percent over two weeks of testing, Prof. Shriya Srinivasan of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University and colleagues reported last week in Science Advances.  During a two-week trial, the pulsating pigs fitted out with the Vibrating Ingestible BioElectronic Stimulator – VIBES for short – ate the same amount of meals as the control animals. But they gained less weight than untreated control pigs, the team reports: their appetite seemed impaired.  This is why? Because the Vibrating Ingestible etc. fooled ""stretch"" receptors in the pig stomach into thinking it was full. Feeling sated, the animals ate less, the team explains. Why test the concept in pigs, of all animals? Because porcine gastric anatomy ""is similar to that of humans,"" the team writes. There are caveats to this study but the news is potentially exciting, even though the methodology might share a similar obstacle as bariatric surgery, gastric sleeves and the like. They're supposed to stop you from overeating by making you feel full. But some people keep overeating anyway.  Be that as it may the team hopes their innovation may help humanity too one day. Their vision for humans involves ingesting a vibrating pill 20 to 30 minutes before the meal, to stimulate faux satiety. Later, it would pass it the usual way. In the pigs, passing the pill took four days.  The VIBES pill was designed to be swallowed, but it's not that small: about 10 by 30 millimeters (0.4 by 1.1 inches), the team says. It contains a silver oxide battery that drives a vibrating offset motor. Once stomach acid dissolves the outer capsule, a spring-loaded ""pogo pin"" is released, which switches on the motor, the team explains.  Now, pilling cats is notoriously difficult; pilling a dog is a joke. How difficult could it be to pill a pig? Well, if the pill isn't chemical but mechanical, we have a snag. ""Repeated oral administration of an electronic pill in a swine model is challenging, as it is hard to prevent biting or chewing,"" the team explains. They add that pigs don't like being manhandled.  The solution was to bypass the pigs' wishes. ""VIBES was en...",0

                WASHINGTON  –  U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Director of Research Dr. Bruce G. Danly, Senior Executive Service (SES), and Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering Senior Scientist (ST) for Biosurveillance Dr. David A. Stenger receive Presidential Rank Awards.

Established in 1978, the Presidential Rank Awards represent the top awards that civilian federal employees can receive. They’re given by the president of the United States to members of the federal Senior Executive Service (SES) who have overseen successful initiatives with a sweeping impact.

The awards also celebrate senior-career employees with sustained records of exceptional professional, technical or scientific achievement recognized on a national or international level. Winners of the awards are considered strong, high-performing leaders who personify excellence in public service.

Danly received the Department of the Navy (DoN) fiscal year 2023 Distinguished Executive Rank Award for his sustained accomplishments in leading the DoN’s corporate laboratory in all aspects of research and development in order to conceive and implement innovations supporting the naval mission both present and future.

“Upon Dr. Danly’s appointment to the position, there was little understanding by the Navy resource sponsors of how funding decisions were made, and how well aligned the research projects were to the Naval strategic priorities,” said Office of Naval Research (ONR) Executive Director Ms. E. Anne Sandel. “Recognizing the importance of coordinating NRL investments with other science and engineering investments by the ONR, Dr. Danly embarked on efforts to achieve better communication and understanding of these Science and Technology investments across a wide range of projects.”

In 2018, Danly served in an additional role as Director of Research at ONR and as Chairman of the ONR Research Council. “This council brought together all NRL and ONR executive leadership across all scientific and engineering disciplines, in order to align programs, eliminate duplication, and foster synergies,” Sandel said.

Recognizing the additional importance of coordination on research areas across other parts of the government, Danly actively participates in the annua...",0

Student concern continues amid Queen’s University financial woes,2024-01-16T23:39:52+00:00,https://globalnews.ca/news/10230540/student-concern-queens-university-financial-woes/,"Instructions: Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first. 
				If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.			 Mired in a serious budget deficit, Queen’s University provost Matthew Evans held a town hall meeting Monday night. The meeting was intended to update staff and students about the university’s $48-million deficit and how that may impact jobs and courses in the future. “I have no idea how this is going to affect me, and I’m in the program,” third-year political science student Cameron Leah said. The Arts and Science Undergraduate Society (ASUS) was at the meeting with the provost. Global News’ request to attend the meeting was denied and requests to speak to the head of ASUS about what was discussed were also not granted. The university’s campus newspaper was allowed to attend the meeting. Evans has not replied to repeated requests for an interview about what changes may result from an apparent annual deficit of $48 million. “Our reserves are rapidly depleting and will not be enough to cover another full year of deficits at the level we are currently operating,” a statement from Queen’s University read. The post-secondary institution is the single largest public sector employer in Kingston. According to the Queen’s University website, the faculty of arts and sciences has 11,000 students and employs 450 faculty. Students on campus are concerned about the impact the deficit will have on classes, supports and programs. “I wish there was more communication. I wish we had a better idea of how this is going to affect us,” Leah said. “We’re always talking about it,” second-year arts and science student David Cox said. “We’re always hearing about how we’re going to have less TAs (teaching assistants), less funding.” Students not in arts and science worry their programs could be next in line for cuts and austerity measures. “I’m a little concerned for the future of how the budgeting is going to go for my program as well, and for future students to come,” Rudy Li, a third-year mechanical engineering student, said to Global News. Only 13 students attended the meeting with Evans, according to the student-operated Queen’s Journal. “In addition to focusing on domestic and international recruitment, we are continuing to prioritize other revenue enhancing activities,” the statement from Queen’s University said. The statement also points the finger at the provincial government’s 10 per cent tuition cut and freeze that came into effect in 2019, along with a decrease in international student enrolment and inflationary pressures. “In terms of trust within the university, I think that the university should’ve done a much, much better job communicating with students about these cuts,” said Leah, who’s concerned about course and staff cuts. The provost is scheduled to speak and take questions at a Jan. 23 Alma Mater Society meeting, perhaps providing greater clarity to studen...",0
What If Cows Could Talk?,2024-01-16T23:07:17+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfggeiFaMyB94vmyuk5fxzE,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   By Eurasia Review  You may not know it, but cows share information every time they burp, moo, and chew that speaks volumes about their health and welfare.  Through the work of researchers in Virginia Tech’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, we may soon know more about what cows are “telling” us and be able to use that information to improve their well-being. James Chen, an animal data sciences researcher and assistant professor in the School of Animal Sciences is using a $650,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture to develop an acoustic, data-driven tool to help enhance animal welfare and lower methane emissions in precision livestock farming.  “Vocalization is a major way cows express their emotions, and it is about time to listen to what they’re telling us,” Chen said.  Because sound data can be collected from cows individually and continuously, Chen said it’s better than video or other observation methods for monitoring cows’ emotions and health, including even subtle changes in breathing. “The assessment of animal welfare has become a central discussion in society and is a controversial issue simply because the lack of objective tools leads to biased interpretations,” he said. “By matching audio data with biological and visual cues, we can be more objective in our approach to analyzing their behavior.” Chen and his co-investigator, Virginia Cooperative Extension dairy scientist and Associate Professor Gonzalo Ferreira, plan to collect audio data from cows, their calves, and beef cattle in the pasture. They will then use machine learning to analyze and catalog thousands of points of acoustic data and interpret cow vocalizations such as mooing, chewing, and burping for signs of stress or illness. “Let’s think about a baby crying inside a plane or in church,” Ferreira said. “As a father, I have an idea whether the baby is crying because it’s hungry or wants attention. Our research question then is: Can we use audio data to interpret animals’ needs?” Chen and Ferreira are particularly interested in identifying vocal patterns for how cows’ communicate distress. By analyzing the frequency, amplitude, and duration of cow’s moos and vocalizations and correlating the sound data with saliva cortisol samples taken from the cow, they can classify whether cows are experiencing no stress, mild stress, or severe stress and begin to decode their “language.” As part of the project, Chen is building a computational pipeline that integrates acoustic data management, pre-trained machine-learning models, and interactive visualization of animal sounds. The resulting data will be shared in an open-source, web-based application available to scientists, producers, and the public. Chen said his hope is that the information will help guide future protocols to improve animal welfare.   “Anyone can directly plug in and use our model to run their own experiment,” he said. “Th...",0

CREDIT: Rahul Jangid/UC Davis By Eurasia Review  A discovery from an experiment with magnets and lasers could be a boon to energy-efficient data storage. “We wanted to study the physics of light-magnet interaction,” said Rahul Jangid, who led the data analysis for the project while earning his Ph.D. in materials science and engineering at UC Davis under associate professor Roopali Kukreja. “What happens when you hit a magnetic domain with very short pulses of laser light?” Domains are areas within a magnet that flip from north to south poles. This property is used for data storage, for example in computer hard drives. Jangid and his colleagues found that when a magnet is hit with a pulsed laser, the domain walls in the ferromagnetic layers move at a speed of approximately 66 km/s, which is about 100 times faster than the speed limit previously thought.  Domain walls moving at this speed could drastically affect the way data is stored and processed, offering a means of faster, more stable memory and reducing energy consumption in spintronic devices such as hard disk drives that use the spin of electrons within magnetic metallic multilayers to store, process or transmit information. “No one thought it was possible to move these walls that fast because they should hit their limit,” said Jangid. “It sounds absolutely bananas, but it’s true.” It’s “bananas,” because of the Walker breakdown phenomenon, which says that domain walls can only be pushed so far at a given velocity before they effectively break down and stop moving. This research, however, gives evidence that the domain walls can be driven at previously unknown velocities using lasers.  While most personal devices like laptops and cell phones use faster flash drives, data centers use cheaper, slower hard disk drives. However, each time a bit of information is processed, or flipped, the drive uses a magnetic field to conduct heat through a coil of wire, burning a lot of energy. If, rather, a drive could use laser pulses on the magnetic layers, the device would operate at a lower voltage and bit flips would take significantly less energy to process. Current projections indicate that by 2030, information and communications technology will account for 21% of the world’s energy demand, exacerbating climate change. This finding, which was highlighted in a paper by Jangid and co-authors titled “Extreme Domain Wall Speeds under Ultrafast Optical Excitation” in the journal Physical Review Letters on Dec. 19, comes at a time when finding energy-efficient technologies is paramount. To conduct the experiment, Jangid and his collaborators, including researchers from the National Institute of ...",0
We Ranked West Coast IPAs To Add Some Bitter Pine To Your Winter,2024-01-16T22:36:38+00:00,https://uproxx.com/life/best-west-coast-ipas-ranked/,"When it comes to winter beers, some drinkers tend to lean toward stouts, porters, winter warmers, and other darker beers. And while we enjoy all of those beer styles — especially when the streets below our apartments seem like frozen tundras — we also enjoy a respite from time to time. And that respite often means making space for a piney, dank, perfectly bitter West Coast IPA. West Coast IPAs are known for their floral, extremely dank, piney flavors, thanks to popular Pacific Northwest hop varietals like Centennial, Chinook, Cascade, Simcoe, and more. It’s a very divisive style — some drinkers find it overly bitter. But if you take the time to find all of the various flavors, working in perfect unison, the hoppy, bitter finish will seem like a chef’s kiss.  There are countless exceptional West Coast IPAs on the market, perfectly suited for winter drinking. But to help you out we picked eight of the best, dank, piney, resinous, kick-your-butt West Coast IPAs on the market and ranked them. Keep scrolling to see them all. ABV: 6.4%% Average Price: $7 for a 22-ounce bottle The Beer: First brewed in 2014, this award-winning, year-round West Coast IPA is known for its mix of citrus peels and dank, bitter hops thanks to the liberal use of Amarillo, Cascade, Mosaic, Simcoe, and Summit hops. It gets its sweet malt backbone from the use of two-row and Munich malts.  Tasting Notes: A nose of grapefruit, tangerine, lemongrass, and dank, piney hops greets you before your first tip. Drinking it reveals a mix of sweet caramel malts as well as orchard fruits, grapefruit, orange zest, mango, guava, ripe peach, and pine needles. The finish is bitter and highly memorable.  Bottom Line: This is a sublimely dank and bitter West Coast IPA, but it has a nice malt backbone that creates a great balance. ABV: 6.8% Average Price: $12 for a six-pack The Beer: Gumberoo is a mythical creature that some lumberjacks claim to have stumbled upon. It’s supposedly bigger than a bear, has a mouth of jagged teeth, and has a hide too strong for bullets to pierce. It’s a strange, scary creature and one the folks at Rogue named their West Coast IPA after. This balanced, year-round beer is brewed with 2-row and Munich malts as well as wheat, Pacman yeast, and Mosaic, Simcoe, Belma, and Idaho 7 hops.  Tasting Notes: The nose is heavy on caramel malts, tangerine, orange peels, ripe grapefruit, and earthy, resinous pine. The palate is loaded with honeydew melon, sweet malts, mango, grapefruit, and dank, resinous pine needles. The ending is bitter pine needles and woodsy flavors.  Bottom Line: This is an epic, dank, bitter West Coast IPA. It’s one that absolutely deserves to be named after a mythical creature. ABV: 7.1% Average Price: $14 for a six-pack The Beer: Cali Boy is one of No Label’s flagship year-round beers for a reason. It’s an amplified, crisp, flavorful West Coast IPA loaded with tropical fruit flavors and dank pine. It’s dry, bitter, and highly memorable. It’s the kind of Wes...",0
GAO Recommends Strengthening Interagency Collaboration to Prevent Foreign Interference in R&D Funding,2024-01-16T22:00:56+00:00,https://executivegov.com/2024/01/gao-recommends-strengthening-interagency-collaboration-to-prevent-foreign-interference-in-randd-funding/,"Processing.... The Government Accountability Office has recommended that the Office of Science and Technology Policy facilitate interagency collaboration when identifying whether a funded organization is under foreign ownership, control or influence, or FOCI. In a new report, GAO found that not all agencies use the same tools to vet foreign applicants for research funding and that existing government-wide databases lack common identifying information, limiting the ability to match foreign entities of concern with organizations receiving federal funding. GAO has raised concerns that some foreign entities may try to jeopardize U.S. national security by exploiting the government’s research and development funding program. To address this, GAO suggested that OSTP coordinate with federal R&D awarding agencies to facilitate information sharing on identifying FOCI. ExecutiveGov, published by Executive Mosaic, is a site dedicated to the news and headlines in the federal government.

 The horrific murder of one of six kidnapped sisters close to Nigeria's capital has gripped and shocked a nation that has become nearly immune to the kidnapping epidemic. JUANA SUMMERS, HOST:  In Nigeria, stories of kidnappings for ransom fill the news on a daily basis. Kidnappings by armed gangs are so frequent that many families don't even report them to police for fear of reprisals and a lack of faith that it will help. But the kidnapping of six sisters and the subsequent murder of one of them has seized the headlines in Nigeria. NPR's Emmanuel Akinwotu is in Lagos. Hi there.EMMANUEL AKINWOTU, BYLINE: Hi, Juana.SUMMERS: Emmanuel, if you can, tell us a little bit more about this case.AKINWOTU: Well, there are so many bleak details. You know, a family, including a father and his six daughters, they were kidnapped on January 2. The abductors then demanded a ransom of about 10,000 U.S. dollars - just a huge amount for an ordinary family. And actually, the family thought they'd done what was asked. They thought they'd raise the funds and were hoping to rescue their children. Actually, what they found out is one of their daughters, Nabeeha, who is a university student, was shot dead and left at the side of the road. The kidnappers then raised the ransom fee by several times that amount and have clearly exploited, basically, the high-profile nature of this case.It's really ignited anger across Nigeria because there's been essentially an epidemic of kidnapping over the last three, four years that many people have just grown desensitized to. You know, thousands of people have been kidnapped. In the year to last June, 3,600 people were abducted, according to one group. And most of these people are in rural parts of the country, poor parts of Nigeria where policing has more or less completely collapsed. I've been speaking to Confidence Isaiah-MacHarry. He is a security analyst at a firm called SBM. He told me that in Nigeria, kidnappers have become so brazen. Let's hear what he has to say.CONFIDENCE ISAIAH-MACHARRY: Kidnappers are now much more emboldened that they no longer just hold onto victims when ransoms are paid. They now also hold the ransom bearers. And for the past year, we've seen these incidents where people who go to pay ransom are also held, and the ransom is demanded on their behalf also.SUMMERS: And, I mean, it's remarkable what he's saying there, that they're not just holding on to victims when these ransoms are paid. They are now also holding the people who pay these ransom. I mean, Emmanuel, as we mentioned earlier, kidnapping for ransom is frequent in Nigeria, but what is it about this case that makes it stand out?AKINWOTU: Well, it's the fact that it's six young women and girls - you know, students with their futures ahead of them who were abducted in this way at the beginning of the year. It's al...",0

"The Australian Government Gears To Place ‘Guard Rails’ On AI, Releases Report",2024-01-16T21:42:22+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/the-australian-government-gears-to-place-guard-rails-on-ai-releases-report/,"The Australian Government wants “guard rails” placed on the rollout of AI to address concerns such as AI taking people’s jobs and endangering lives in risk areas such as self-driving cars. Science and Industry Minister Ed Husic has released the government’s interim response to the 510 submissions it received in response to the Safe and Responsible AI paper released in June last year. Recommended measures include the watermarking of AI-generated content, the mandatory testing and labelling of AI models before they are implemented, and an expert advisory committee to assist in what is a fast-moving area of technology that outpaces regulators. The advisory committee would develop a voluntary AI safety standard to assist businesses implementing AI solutions. According to the government’s paper, AI and automation could grow Australia’s economy by $170bn to $600bn a year. But high risk uses such as using AI to assess job applications and to operate self-driving cars needed examination. Transparency measures such as publicly reporting how an AI model was trained is also under consideration. Mr Husic would require the developers of GPT products such as Microsoft, OpenAI and Google to comply with Australian law. The government separately is looking at the proliferation of deep fakes online, along with breaches of copyright and privacy perpetrated by AI training models. Its preference is to add provisions to stop the excesses of AI in existing law rather than develop separate legislation such as an AI Act in the European Union. Observers will be watching closely whether this plan not to follow the EU’s approach to AI regulation flows through to other areas of regulating the big tech firms, especially when it comes to anti-trust laws. The European Union through its executive European Commission has taken a long term stand against the excesses of the big tech firms: their anti-trust manoeuvrings to gain market advantage, and their disregard for the rights of consumers, especially privacy. European users are set to benefit when its Digital Markets Act takes force in March; whether Australian users get a similar benefit through Australian law in the longer term remains to be seen. The report’s release comes a day after Microsoft unveiled its commercial generative AI product, Copilot Pro, which includes an ability for individuals and companies to create their own version of ChatGPT. The Tech Council of Australia said providing clarity on the Australian Government’s approach to AI regulation would help businesses better plan for building, investing in and adopting AI products and services. The public could take confidence that AI risks are being safely managed and regulated in Australia, it said. “This approach is the best way to balance innovation with the need to ensure that AI is developed safely and responsibly”, said Tech Council CEO Kate Pounder. “Australia has a sound, existing legal framework relevant to AI, and expert regulators that regulate products u...",0

EU court dismisses Eva Kaili’s legal challenge on immunity,2024-01-16T20:00:00+00:00,https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-court-dismisse-eva-kaili-legal-challenge-immunity/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication,"
				The Greek lawmaker had sought to annul a request to lift her parliamentary protection from prosecution.			 Eva Kaili, the key suspect in the Qatargate scandal and a former European Parliament vice-president, lost a legal challenge at the General Court of the European Union on Tuesday, thereby dashing her hopes of derailing one of the probes she faces regarding alleged misuse of EU funds.   The Greek EU lawmaker had sought to annul a request to lift her legislative immunity as part of the investigation into allegedly fraudulent payments made to four of her former assistants in the European Parliament, according to a letter from the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which is handling the case, to Parliament President Roberta Metsola. The General Court, which settles disputes over decisions involving the EU institutions, dismissed Kaili’s action “as inadmissible in its entirety” and backed the actions of the European Chief Prosecutor and the president of the Parliament before a definitive decision on her immunity was taken by the legislature. Until then, the court ruled, Kaili continued “to benefit from the protection of the privileges and immunities granted by EU law.” Kaili has also started another legal challenge claiming her immunity was violated as part of the Qatargate investigation, the biggest corruption scandal to hit the Parliament in decades. She has been provisionally charged with corruption, partaking in a criminal organization and money laundering, but has maintained her innocence and launched a media offensive to turn the tables on the prosecution. Eva Kaili, her lawyers and a spokesperson from the European Public Prosecutor’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Thierry Breton stirs the pot. Again.  Wealthy voters fear something bigger than taxes is threatening their lavish lifestyle.

Reverse Aging in Six Months without Treatments or Therapies with Greg Lindberg’s Lifelong Program,2024-01-16T19:53:21+00:00,https://www.send2press.com/wire/reverse-aging-in-six-months-without-treatments-or-therapies-with-greg-lindbergs-lifelong-program/,"  PRESS RELEASE: Source: Lifelong Labs   |  Tue, 16 Jan 2024, 14:53:21 EST ORLANDO, Fla., Jan. 16, 2024 (SEND2PRESS NEWSWIRE) — In a revolutionary breakthrough, wellness advocate Greg Lindberg, founder of Lifelong Labs, has uncovered the secrets to reversing aging, offering a glimpse into a future where the effects of aging can be halted and even rolled back within six months. Image Caption: “LIFELONG” by wellness advocate Greg Lindberg. This breakthrough, backed by science and years of testing, challenges the conventional understanding of aging and introduces a safe, effective and comprehensive approach to longevity. The findings, published in Lindberg’s latest book “LIFELONG,” unveil a cutting-edge program that comprises of three simple pillars: Fast and feast, mental and physical challenge and cold and heat exposure. “This program is the secret to reversing aging,” said Lindberg “This simple, free program keeps you younger, healthier and stronger without medication or any therapies and treatments. If you can do a combination of fasting, feasting, exercising, intellectual training, and cold and heat exposure, you can reverse aging and prevent disease.” For the last three years, Lindberg has been testing the program on himself by fasting at least 90-hour per week and practicing daily intense physical and mental exercise. His results have been groundbreaking. The program got him off any prescription medications, rejuvenated his body, turned his gray hair red again and reduced his skin wrinkles. “In the last three years, I turned myself into a human laboratory, starting a strict program of fasting and feasting, high-intensity exercise, profound learning and community service,” said Lindberg. “I now feel healthier, stronger and younger than ever. I did it without medications, interventions, doctors, personal trainers or nutritionists.” In the book, Lindberg emphasizes the program is a lifelong journey that requires extreme discipline and focus. He says this is a lifestyle not a temporary solution. Before joining the journey, Lindberg recommends doing full blood and allergy testing. He also recommends speaking to a health care provider if the program is right for you. Lindberg shares this life-changing program in detail in his latest book “LIFELONG,” which is now available on Amazon ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CMZNMHDC ).

Predictions for GenAI adoption in 2024,2024-01-16T19:47:40+00:00,https://betanews.com/2024/01/16/predictions-for-genai-adoption-in-2024/,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) entered the public consciousness and debate about one year ago. As a science, it goes back several years but as an applicable piece of software, it is very much in its infancy.  Text, images, and audio can be generated by GenAI models,but their integration into existing software tools worldwide is still in its early stages. Similarly, the majority of business leaders are only talking about GenAI, with some experimenting through proofs of concepts, while a small minority have deployed initial, and usually specific, use cases. In public and private discussions, most time is spent on the following questions:  In short, the current school of thought is that GenAI is good enough for some applications but not others due to making factual and logical errors called ‘hallucinations’. Users must carefully examine use cases on their own merits. For example, some have reported that the value of the technology lies in an increase of desk worker productivity rates by about 30-40 percent.  From a legal standpoint, given the fact that several lawsuits and governmental regulations are still in flight, the legal status of GenAI is uncertain. However, this will continue to be a complex road, and some years will pass before stable legislation will be available in most major countries.  And lastly, in positive news for humankind, GenAI is very far from sentient. No one is really working on making it conscious because the industry is still deciphering how to make money from what it has — GenAI will certainly not be the end of  us.  Delving into the major uses of GenAI, we can expect to see significant adoption in 2024 alongside large measurable business value. One: Source code generation. Computer programmers, both individually and in teams, have achieved great productivity gains by using GenAI to make first drafts for source code, comments, and documentation. This is the only well-established wide-spread business use case to date that has reliable benefit metrics. Two: Enterprise search. GenAI is able to search through the entire storage of proprietary information of your company including audio or video recordings. It will generate not a hit list of links but fully formed answers to your questions. Imagine being able to ask questions of thousands of recorded customer phone calls. This is a capability that only exists due to GenAI, and is currently valued at a staggering $4.5b. Three: Summarisation. Picture being faced with long texts or videos while only needing the gist of what is being covered. GenAI is able to provide a good summary of the content instantly, saving time whilst preserving the essential information. Four: Customer support. Support hotlines currently work either in a rigid decision-tree mode that frustrates everyone or in human mode where a person attends the customer. GenAI combined with voice capabilities can provide basic support to many simple queries without involving a human agent - and without frustr...",0

Michigan AD Warde Manuel, staying true to his statement of “working on it” came back with some even exciting and favorable terms for Jim Harbaugh. The original contract extension stood at $125 million, running through 2026. However, the supposed root of hesitation was Harbaugh not leaving the NFL at least for 2024. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Per Dov Kleiman, Harbaugh engaged in talks with Michigan officials, and can still choose to stay at Ann Arbor. That comes with additional benefits for Harbaugh. The first ones are the monetary ones. While the previous pay that Michigan offered set Jim Harbaugh as one of the top-paid college football coaches, the updated one will make him ‘the most-paid college football coach’. For 6 years, Harbaugh would be paid $11.5 million guaranteed per year, along with added performance bonuses. However, this is not the most tempting part. 𝐑𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭: Jim Harbaugh's potential Michigan extension contract details, per @DanWetzel: – 6 years, $11.5 million guaranteed per year (the highest in college football) – Immunity from termination for any finding from multiple current NCAA investigations Those are some… pic.twitter.com/dYmHoKTM4U — Dov Kleiman (@NFL_DovKleiman) January 16, 2024  Following the previous season’s NCAA investigation breakouts, Harbaugh’s updated contract grants him termination from any finding or sanction that could arise from multiple ongoing NCAA investigations. The NCAA investigations and their consequences were assumed to be one of the biggest hindrances in Jim Harbaugh’s deal with Michigan. Now, with this issue sorted, at least from Michigan’s end, Harbaugh can be rest assured.

To maintain lower buyout rates than the NFL teams would have to pay Michigan to take him with them. Per his current contract, his buyout rate dropped to $1.5 million from $2.25 million on January 11.

"Fake Immunity (Cartoon, Column and Video)",2024-01-16T18:17:49+00:00,https://themoderatevoice.com/fake-immunity-cartoon-column-and-video/,"The Moderate Voice An Internet hub with domestic and international news, analysis, original reporting, and popular features from the left, center, indies, centrists, moderates, and right January 16, 2024 by Clay Jones Leave a Comment  ‘ It’s very hard to argue that Donald Trump is innocent of trying to steal the 2020 election he lost to Joe Biden. There’s a recording of Trump and Republican National Committee Chairperson Ronna McDaniel pressuring the Wayne County Board of Canvassers in Michigan not to certify the results there despite no evidence of fraud.  There’s a recording of Trump pressuring Georgia’s Secretary of State to “find him” 11,780 votes. Trump tried to install fake electors to replace real electors that would certify the election for Joe Biden, who, again, won. Trump, along with Rudy Giuliani, spread lies about election workers which led to them being harassed and receiving death threats from MAGA goons. Donald Trump sent a mob of white nationalist goons to attack the Capitol while Congress was doing its constitutional duty of certifying the election. Since he’s obviously guilty, because the argument it was his job to overturn an election he lost isn’t going to work anywhere, the only other argument to save him from a guilty verdict and years in a federal or state prison is he has immunity. Three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. heard arguments last week over whether the Constitution makes former presidents immune from criminal prosecution. Richard Nixon also made an argument that it’s “not illegal if the president does it,” before resigning the presidency and receiving a pardon from President Gerald Ford. People who have immunity don’t need pardons. Special Counsel Jack Smith has charged Trump with four counts related to his attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election he lost to Joe Biden. In addition to arguing that Trump has immunity from charges and is free to break any law he wishes, Trump’s lawyer,  D. John Sauer, argued that prosecuting Trump now would constitute double jeopardy since he was already impeached and acquitted by Congress. The only problem with that argument is that it’s NOT double jeopardy as Congress is NOT a court of law. Even if the Senate had ruled Trump was guilty, it would not have issued any sentences other than removing him from office and preventing him from running for president again. Congress can only refer criminal charges to the Justice Department. Trump’s lawyer argued that Trump could order Seal Team 6 to murder political opponents and sell pardons and nuclear secrets without the fear of prosecution, which is oddly specific. Trump’s lawyer argued that presidents going unpunished after opening a Pandora’s box of horrible acts in the future wasn’t the real fear, but future presidents living in fear of being prosecuted after doing horrible things is the real worry. It seems to me that future presidents should be afraid of trying to overturn an election they lost, sendi...",0

Doctor Michael Mosley reveals daily 3p dementia pill that could ward off disease,2024-01-16T16:56:22+00:00,https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/doctor-michael-mosley-reveals-daily-31896048,"This cheap and simple supplement could also boost your immune system, warding off infections and colds, according to the health expert. Doctor Michael Mosley has revealed a cheap daily supplement that could ward off dementia in later life. Our body requires many different vitamins and minerals to keep it in tip-top shape, and keep it functioning properly throughout our lives. Most people can get all they need through a healthy, balance diet - but sometimes, this isn't always possible, reports the Express. Due to this, a lot of people rely on daily supplements to keep their bodies fit and healthy. Now, Michael Mosley has said a certain pill taken daily can actually reduce your risk of dementia. Speaking on his podcast, Just One Thing, the diet guru recommended the pill could also have other health benefits, as well as costing just three pence per day. In the new episode, Michael discussed the benefits of taking vitamin D each day, saying it can boost your immune system, as well as helping your brain to ward off depression and even dementia. He said: ""I don’t usually recommend supplements, but I do make an exception for this one. It’s vitamin D. It is essential for healthy bones and a properly functioning immune system."" We typically get vitamin D through sunlight, so many people across the UK can end up deprived at this time of year - due to the duller weather. Dr Mosley said: ""Unfortunately, at this time of year in the UK, many of us are deficient in vitamin D, and that’s because it just simply isn’t bright enough out there to generate vitamin D in our skin."" This advice from the expert was backed by a 2023 medical study, published in the journal Alzheimer's and Dementia: Translational Research and Clinical Interventions. More than 12,000 people took part in the study, which looked at the links between vitamin D levels and Alzheimer's - a form of dementia. The research found exposure to vitamin D was 40 per cent lower incidence of dementia - and it was ""significantly greater"" among women than men. The study said: ""Vitamin D has potential for dementia prevention, especially in the high-risk strata."" Another study, published in Neurology journal in 2014, also came to a similar conclusion when it came to vitamin D and dementia. They said: ""Our results confirm that vitamin D deficiency is associated with a substantially increased risk of all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease."" ""This adds to the ongoing debate about the role of vitamin D in non skeletal conditions."" You can get a bottle of 90 vitamin D tablets for £2.49 from Holland & Barrett, working out at under three pence a tablet. Asda also sells a bottle of 60 for £1.50, which is 25p per tablet.

The reason can be the fluctuations of weather, slope conditions, or how stable the ski gears are. While the alpine GOAT Mikaela Shiffrin sat out on both the races in Altenmarkt-Zauchensee, her Swiss counterpart emerged victorious in Super-G. But peeking inside the men’s skiing world, Shiffrin’s closest one faced a brutal injury keeping his winning streak at a standstill. While competing in the Lauberhorn test at the Wengen downhill, Mikaela Shiffrin’s long-term Norwegian skier beau Aleksander Kilde met with a brutal injury. Being less mindful of when to jump, the skier flew to hit the safety net before the finish line. As Kilde worked on his recovery, an apparel giant brand worth $5.01 billion extended heartfelt wishes.

Right after an unofficial deal signing announcement, the skier secured the confirmation by walking for BOSS at the Fall/Winter 2023 runway show during Milan Fashion Week.

So, during the 31-year-old’s hard times, his beloved brand posted an Instagram story with the caption “Get well very soon BOSS! See you on the slopes in no time” and teamed it up with a red heart.

Report: Jim Harbaugh Seeks Immunity from Firing from NCAA Probe in Michigan Contract,2024-01-16T15:51:17+00:00,https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10105285-report-jim-harbaugh-seeks-immunity-from-firing-from-ncaa-probe-in-michigan-contract," Should Jim Harbaugh sign a new contract to remain the head football coach at the University of Michigan, he is reportedly seeking assurances that he won't be fired. According to Dan Wetzel of Yahoo Sports, Harbaugh is having ongoing contract talks with Michigan, and as part of a potential new deal, he wants immunity from firing regardless of what ongoing NCAA investigations into him and the program produce. Harbaugh is also keeping his options open in the form of possibly leaving for the NFL, as he interviewed with the Los Angeles Chargers for their vacant head coaching position on Monday. During the 2023 season, Harbaugh served two separate suspensions of three games apiece for separate violations. Harbaugh served a self-imposed three-game game ban to start the season because of violations that occurred during the COVID-19 dead period. The Big Ten later suspended Harbaugh for the final three games of the regular season after it was determined that Michigan illegally scouting teams off campus and stole signs. Michigan's sign-stealing scheme was allegedly run by former staffer Connor Stalions and a booster, and it featured Stalions and other representatives of the Michigan football team attending games involving future Wolverines opponents and recording the sidelines in an effort to steal and decode their signals. Stalions resigned from his position, and even though Harbaugh denied having any knowledge of or involvement with the controversy, the Big Ten suspended him nonetheless. Harbaugh returned to the sidelines to coach Michigan to victory over Iowa in the Big Ten Championship Game. The Wolverines then defeated Alabama in the Rose Bowl and Washington in the College Football Playoff National Championship Game to finish 15-0 and win their first national title since 1997. While Harbaugh brought glory back to his alma mater, the possibility remains that NCAA sanctions could be on the horizon for him and the Michigan football program as a whole depending on what is found through multiple investigations. Going back to the NFL would leave Harbaugh free and clear of any discipline, and it appears to be a real possibility since he is likely the hottest candidate available along with longtime New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick. Harbaugh previously coached the San Francisco 49ers for four seasons, and he enjoyed great success, taking them to the NFC Championship Game three times and the Super Bowl once. However, if Harbaugh decides to stay in the college ranks, he is not only seeking immunity from firing based on the findings of current investigations, but he reportedly wants future assurances as well. Per Wetzel, Harbaugh wants language in his contract that would prevent Michigan's athletic director from firing him for cause if future issues arise. Harbaugh is reportedly asking that a three-member arbitration panel decide his fate in such a case. Harbaugh reportedly has an offer of six years and $11.5 million annually on the table from Michi...",0

Australia may ask tech companies to label content generated by AI platforms such as ChatGPT,2024-01-16T14:00:03+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/17/australia-ai-content-label-chatgpt-tech-companies-law-labor-government-policy,"New report reveals low public trust of growing technology as government pledges stricter regulation for ‘high risk’ products Tech companies could be asked to watermark or label content generated by artificial intelligence such as ChatGPT as the federal government grapples with “high risk” AI products evolving faster than legislation. The industry and science minister, Ed Husic, will on Wednesday release the government’s response to a consultation process on safe and responsible AI in Australia, which cites McKinsey research to suggest adopting AI and automation could increase Australia’s GDP by up to $600bn a year. However, the response also notes public concern about the technology and Husic said that while the government wanted to see “low risk” uses of AI continue to flourish, some applications – including self-driving cars or programs assessing job applications – need new and stricter regulation. “Australians understand the value of artificial intelligence but they want to see the risks identified and tackled,” Husic said. “We have heard loud and clear that Australians want stronger guardrails to manage higher-risk AI.” The paper notes surveys showing only a third of Australians believe there are adequate “guardrails” for the design and development of AI, saying: “While AI is forecast to grow our economy, there is low public trust that AI systems are being designed, developed, deployed and used safely and responsibly.” The interim response pledges the government would immediately set up an expert advisory group on development of AI policy, including further guardrails; develop a voluntary “AI safety standard” as a single source for businesses wanting to integrate AI tech into their systems; and start consulting with industry on new transparency measures. Also on the table for further consideration are mandatory safeguards including pre-deployment risk and harm prevention testing of new products and accountability measures such as training standards for software developers. The interim response paper refers several areas of reform to further processes of consultation and review, with boosting transparency measures around AI – such as public reporting on what data an AI model is trained on – one suggestion. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The government will also “commence work with industry” on the merits of another suggestion – a voluntary code on including watermarks or labelling of AI-generated content. The changes would come in addition to existing work from the federal government, such as communications minister Michelle Rowland’s pledge to change online safety laws and require tech companies to stamp out AI-created harmful material such as deepfake intimate images and hate speech. Reviews are also under way on the use of generative AI in schools and through the AI in Government taskforce. Sign up to Afternoon Update Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the k...",0

It seems to me that the conservative judges, following Justice Scalia’s passion for a thought process called originalism, essentially thought the framers of the Constitution achieved perfection which should be resurrected in the ensuing years. Of course, we can also argue here that the typical conservative is afraid of change. Considering the current debate over whether Trump should be on the ballot in this year’s presidential election we are confronted with the 14th Amendment and all of the arguments about what the 14th Amendment means. It is very clear that the 14th Amendment is anything but perfect as we would consider it today and as the Court tries to grasp how it applies to Jan. 6, 2021. The history of Supreme Court rulings, particularly by conservative justices, has consistently deferred to the legislature in narrow issues. Here, one of the main arguments about leaving Trump on the ballot is that he has not been convicted in a court of law of insurrection. The 14th Amendment does not specifically require that the insurrectionist be convicted but the history of due process in other areas of the law certainly suggests a valid Supreme Court decision requires a criminal conviction. It seems to me that there is an argument that a mob acting on 45’s verbal instigations has been convicted of insurrection by the scores. At any rate, it is pretty clear here that originalism is a flawed way to interpret the Constitution and secondly, in acknowledging how imperfect the Constitution itself can be, the Supreme Court has to make decisions based upon the best public policy which of course is a problem because there is so much dissension over what the correct public policy should be. So in the end the decision will be a political one. Rick Kalamaya, Longmont  Donald Trump is in court claiming that, as president during his one term, he was immune from criminal charges for all of his activities while in office and so is wrongly being prosecuted in multiple venues. Yet at the same time, he very regularly calls for the criminal prosecution of his election opponent, Joe Biden, the current president of the nation, who, by Trump’s logic, is similarly immune from being charged. How many of the former president’s supporters are coming to the realization that their preferred candidate’s behavior shows clearly how little he respects their intelligence and ability to discern his senseless, deceitful defense of his many, many illegal actions?

Humpback Whales Move Daytime Singing Offshore,2024-01-24T23:24:49+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe_DlOZaUDQnKvLeqE6yv18,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   By Eurasia Review  Humpback whale singing dominates the marine soundscape during winter months off Maui. However, despite decades of research, many questions regarding humpback whale behavior and song remain unanswered. New research revealed a daily pattern wherein whales move their singing away from shore throughout the day and return to the nearshore in the evening. The findings were led by the University of Hawaiʻi, in partnership with NOAA’s Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary, and published in Royal Society Open Science.  “Singers may be attempting to reduce the chances of their song being drowned out among the cacophony nearshore when whale numbers are high,” said Anke Kügler, lead author of the study who was a doctoral student in the Marine Biology Graduate Program at UH Mānoa at the time of the research. “Further, we documented humpback whales moving closer to shore around sunset, possibly to avoid the offshore evening chorus of other animals.” By using a combination of underwater listening devices and visual surveys, the research team was able to track both the physical movements and the acoustic patterns of whales in the high-density breeding grounds found in Hawai‘i.  “This dynamic onshore-offshore movement of singers may be aimed at increasing the efficiency of the whales’ acoustic display, ensuring that other whales hear their songs,” said Marc Lammers, study co-author and research ecologist with NOAA’s Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary. “This is the first effort of its kind, to our knowledge, in which we used specialized acoustic sensors to localize individual singers relatively close to shore to understand daily variations in the distance to shore of these nearshore singers, their spacing, and their movement behavior,” said Kügler. “This helped contextualize the visual results and overcome some of the limitations from the land-based visual observations of movement.” Humpback whale song is presumed to play an important role for breeding. The new findings highlight the significance for male singers of an environment that is teeming with acoustic commotion. Through their approach, the team identified potential drivers for the daily onshore-offshore migrations—nearshore environments that are too crowded with whales during the day and offshore areas that are too noisy with the chorus of other animals in the evening.   “Discussions of noise pollution related to marine mammals have been dominated by concerns over anthropogenic noise,” said Kügler. “Potential acoustic masking from natural sources, including one whale masking another whale’s song, has been mostly overlooked. By exploring possible drivers of the observed patterns, we add to our understanding of how animals that rely on acoustic signals adopt behavioral strategies to mitigate masking from loud environments.” Humpback whales are ecologically, economically, and culturally significant in Hawai‘i and ...",0
Researchers Advocate For Sustainable Logging To Safeguard Against Global Flood Risks,2024-01-24T23:17:28+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWduENW5zJouL7myhX6zo8SW,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   Flooding in British Columbia's Fraser Valley in November 2021. Credit: UBC Applied Science  By Eurasia Review  It’s time to recognize the power of healthy forests in managing global growing flood risk, and to shift towards more sustainable forestry practices and policy. This call is emphasized by UBC researchers in a peer-reviewed article published recently in the journal Science of the Total Environment. Dr. Younes Alila, a hydrologist and professor in the faculty of forestry, and his graduate student Henry Pham synthesized decades of hydrology studies and found that many “severely and consistently underestimated” the impact of forest cover on flood risk. As a consequence, it led to forest management policies and practices that were either unsound or poorly informed. For more than a century, Dr. Alila explained, scientists have clung to a “deterministic” analysis. To use a strategic board game analogy, this is like looking at each move in isolation and thinking, “If I move here, then I should win.” It fails to account for the roll of the dice, the cards you draw, and what your opponents might do—all of which can change the game. When it comes to understanding how logging might increase flood risk, a deterministic approach would look at the logging alone and try to figure out its direct effect. But the risk of flooding is influenced by many things, such as how much snow is on the ground, whether it’s melting or not, how much rain is falling, and the characteristics of the landscape itself. These factors interact over time in complex ways. Taking them all into account is called a “probabilistic” approach and provides a better overall picture of flood risk. It’s like a savvy board game player considering all the game’s variables instead of just one. “The probabilistic approach is already well established in other disciplines such as climate change science. It is the most accurate method for evaluating the effects of deforestation on floods,” said Henry Pham, a student in UBC’s master of science in forestry program. Dr. Alila says the probabilistic framework is designed to understand and predict, for instance, how much of the 2021 Fraser Valley floods could be attributed to climate change, land use change or logging. The approach also can be extended to investigate the causes of flood risk in other cities and regions. He added: “In B.C. alone, the flood risk is escalating as we continue to lose forest cover due to ongoing large-scale logging and wildfires. If we want to mitigate the costs of disasters like the 2021 flooding in the Fraser Valley or the 2018 flooding in Grand Forks, we need to change the way we manage our forest cover. Regenerative practices such as selective logging, small patch cutting, and other alternatives to clear-cutting are an important way forward.” Pham noted that clear-cut logging causes more severe and much more frequent floods, and such floods can have harsh consequences. “They can negati...",0

                The Air Force designated Jan. 22-26, 2024, as Biomedical Sciences Corps Appreciation Week, a week to honor the history and recognize the men and women who comprise the BSC and all that they bring to the fight.

The Biomedical Sciences Corps’ [https://www.airforcemedicine.af.mil/About-Us/Medical-Branches/Biomedical-Sciences-Corps/] roots date back to 1917 when the U.S. Army’s Sanitary Corps was established to combat infectious diseases. The Army Medical Administrative Corps followed three years later. In 1949, the Air Force Medical Service was officially established. The Air Force Medical Service continued to expand over the next two decades and in 1965, the Biomedical Sciences Corps was born. Over the past 58 years, the BSC continued to expand its range of personnel to include a wide variety of medically trained professionals.

The BSC is one of the most diverse corps in the Air Force Medical Service, with more than 2,300 officers, 5,600 enlisted members, 2,000 civilians, and covering 13 distinct professions under one banner. Leading the way in diversity across healthcare, our slogan this year is “Stronger Together!”

As the Air Force Medical Service continues to strengthen capabilities, the Air Force Medical Command, also known as AFMED, has been established and best postures the service to balance health care delivery and readiness. BSC leadership encourages members to know your local mission, be engaged across your base, and continue to excel within your profession. 

This week, BSC leadership will deliver cutting edge panels including, senior leader discussions and career broadening insights. The BSC will also be conducting a “Rep Your Base” social media campaign on the BSC Facebook page. [https://www.facebook.com/AFMSBiomedicalSciencesCorps]

Please join the Air Force in celebrating Biomedical Sciences Corps Week and recognizing the contributions of these outstanding professionals who dedicate their careers to delivering trusted care and improving the health and lethality of our most vital resource, the human weapon system.

Starring Kim Tae-ri, Ryu Jun-yeol, Kim Woo-bin, Kim Eul-sung, Yoon Kyung-ho, Cho Woo-jin, and Lee Si-hoon. (Opens Friday at AMC Grapevine Mills) Barbie (PG-13) This philosophical statement about being a woman in present-day society is likely the strangest Hollywood blockbuster you’ll see all year, and much more than the crass corporate product it could have been. A perfectly pitched Margot Robbie plays a Barbie doll who has to travel from Barbie Land to our reality to discover why she’s having random thoughts about death. When Ken (Ryan Gosling) follows her into our reality, he likes the sight of men running everything and tries to turn Barbie Land into another patriarchy. All this takes place against a backdrop that’s wholly committed to Barbie-ness, with streets lined with life-size Barbie Dream Houses and more pink than you’ve ever seen in your life. If the storytelling loses a bit in its last third, the loose ends fit a story about the messiness of being a woman (or a man). This girly film is also thoughtful, complex, and funny, and will ensure that you never look at a Barbie doll the same way again. Also with America Ferrera, Arianna Greenblatt, Emma Mackey, Issa Rae, Beanie Feldstein, Simu Liu, Michael Cera, Will Ferrell, Kate McKinnon, Alexandra Shipp, Hari Nef, Sharon Rooney, Ritu Arya, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Ncuti Gatwa, Nicola Coughlan, Emerald Fennell, Scott Evans, Sharon Rooney, Ana Cruz Kayne, Rhea Perlman, and John Cena.

Also with Anil Kapoor, Karan Singh Grover, Akshay Oberoi, Akarsh Alagh, Vinay Varma, Sanjeev Jaiswal, and Birol Tarkan Yildiz. (Opens Friday) The Holdovers (R) Paul Giamatti seems to do his best acting for Alexander Payne, and this may be the performance of his career. He portrays a schoolteacher in 1970 who’s stuck babysitting the handful of students at his ritzy all-male New England prep school who have nowhere to go over Christmas break. Screenwriter David Hemingson does an excellent job of capturing the protagonist’s erudite voice as he insults his students’ intelligence and can’t get through a conversation without referencing the Peloponnesian War. When only one student (Dominic Sessa) is left on campus, the movie becomes a piercing but also quite funny portrait of the loneliness of the teacher, the student, and the cafeteria worker (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) who has lost her son in Vietnam.

TODAY Sports Jim Harbaugh, the coach for Michigan, changes the entire trajectory of his career situation with this newest update. The 60-year-old can’t seem to make up his mind about whether to stay back with Michigan for his 10th season or to finally pursue his dreams of a Super Bowl. The Michigan Wolverines have achieved the pinnacle of success under Jim Harbaugh. They won the 2023 CFP national championship after winning all of their 15 games in a row. There’s not a lot left for college football to offer Harbaugh and going to the NFL seems like the next best logical step. But the football spins in unprecedented ways as the newest reports suggest that Harbaugh might just stay back with his beloved Michigan team. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In the newest update, Harbaugh’s career situation takes yet another drastic turn. With the NFL conversations getting stronger for the coach, the Michigan Wolverines have offered more incentives for the 60-year-old. The LA Chargers are seemingly the leading candidate to potentially sign Harbaugh, but the talks haven’t yet led to an official confirmation. The Michigan team has released a better offer for him and maybe he just might be convinced to stay back. Per sources: Michigan has offered Harbaugh a contract that will make him the highest paid coach in college. They have sweetened the incentives and added….and this is the big part….more protections for him in case the NCAA comes knocking. Michigan and Harbaugh are very close… https://t.co/ixuBcuijjm — MichiganNation2 (@MichiganNation2) January 24, 2024  The reports state, “Michigan has offered Harbaugh a contract that will make him the highest-paid coach in college. They have sweetened the incentives and added….and this is the big part….more protections for him in case the NCAA comes knocking. Michigan and Harbaugh are very close to a deal. But he is still expected to listen to the NFL and “hear them out.” Thus, this is the twist in the tale as the fans have been expecting Harbaugh to finally move to the NFL after years of flirting with the league. As Michigan and the Chargers engage in a bidding war to keep Harbaugh, the Atlanta Falcons also join the scene of the battle.

He will also achieve a long-held dream of graduating with a university degree. The father of two from Middelburg, in the Eastern Cape, will graduate with Bachelor of Education (BEd) in intermediate teaching from the University of South Africa. Dalimfazwe, who started as a security guard at Spark Schools Randpark Ridge in 2018, is now an online teacher at Spark Schools Rivonia. His focus is in mathematics, natural science and social science. He dropped out of school in Grade 10 to find work in Johannesburg. The reason was to help his single mother take care of four siblings. “I decided to discontinue my education, feeling the burden on my mother was too great,” he said.  After doing a short course to become a security guard in 1999, he found a job. While working as a guard, his ambitions to complete his matric and further his studies encouraged him to study part-time. He matriculated in 1998. In 2018 when he joined the school as a security guard. He was studying for a Higher Certificate in Adult Basic Education at Unisa. When a position of supervisor for the aftercare programme became available at the school in 2019, he applied and was successful. It was the same year that he was enrolled for his BEd degree. He will graduate in April. In 2020 he was appointed a blended learning facilitator for online classes in natural science, social science and maths. This secured him a long-term position at the school. His role since the end of last year has been working with intermediate phase learners. The father of boys aged 22 and 13, said his children are aware of the sacrifices he made to realise his dream. Dalimfazwe’s youngest son started Grade 8 this year in George, Western Cape. His eldest dropped out of school in grade 11. He hopes his first-born will finally heed his advice to study at a technical and vocational education and training college. “I tell him that I do not want him to face the same challenges I went through. He has an opportunity to learn a skill that will earn him a good living. I remind him that he can achieve anything if he is willing to put in the hard work,” he said.

Innovations Editor African scientists must join the global critical mass of researchers by writing more articles on gene editing science and other emerging biotechnology subjects to inform policies that will contribute to the economic and social development of the continent, a senior official in the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) says. Anna Tinarwo, a chief director in the Office of the President and Cabinet told participants at a workshop to validate a Genome Editing (Ged) Science Module course for local universities and research institutions that African scientists were best placed to identify the most relevant and pressing local problems. “To date, more than 5 000 articles have been written on genome editing. Scientists from Africa should contribute to the body of knowledge on GeD. The innovations will lead to improvements in our agriculture and health sectors,” she said. “Your contributions in well-referred journals and other publications should lead to improvements in food and nutrition security. The validation of this module supported by the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD), the Scientific and Industrial Research and Development Centre (SIRDC) and the National Biotechnology Authority will enhance the sharing of knowledge and expertise.” Tinarwo said it was important to build the capacity of African scientists to help develop African-led models that provide innovative solutions to the continent’s pressing problems. African scientists often have limited access to scientific publications and research support services and experts note that the legacies of colonialism – such as funding and publishing structures – continue to favour Northern-based researchers The African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD), the Scientific and Industrial Research and Development Centre (SIRDC), and National Biotechnology Authority organised the workshop to help strengthen the capacity of local universities and colleges to adopt gene editing as a tool to optimise the country’s agricultural sector. The country’s scientific experts were meeting this week to review gene editing modules before they are published and adopted in institutions of higher learning. The workshop also sought to introduce university lecturers to four carefully crafted modules that have been developed by experts at AUDA-NEPAD. The modules were designed to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of genome editing, covering both the scientific principles and the ethical considerations surrounding this cutting-edge technology. Speaking at the same event, Dr Bongani Nkhabindze, AUDA-NEPAD programmes officer hailed Zimbabwean scientists for working hard to come up with a robust module for use in local universities and institutions. “The good working spirit shown in this meeting is highly commendable. We had very robust group work and suggestions. This gives justice to the actual module which will not be used in Zimbabwe alone, but throughout Afr...",0

Unraveling the mystery: Strange helicopters spotted soaring across Southern Utah skies,2024-01-24T14:51:19+00:00,https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2024/01/24/jsb-unraveling-the-mystery-strange-helicopters-spotted-soaring-across-southern-utah-skies/,"ST. GEORGE — Have you seen low-level helicopters flying above Washington County lately? Its stinger-like front has some members of the community asking questions.  Jamey Jones, who serves as the associate science center director for the U.S. Geological Survey, told St. George News the helicopters are part of a national program called the Earth Mapping Resources Initiative. “The goal of Earth MRI, as we call it, is to basically map the nation, especially in places where there is potential for mineral resources, particularly critical mineral sources, as presently defined,” Jones said.  The Earth MRI project started in the U.S. in 2019. And after the center received a significant investment through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the project’s data collection abilities were accelerated.   Jones said they started collecting data from Southern Utah last year and the data collection is ongoing. He said he predicts the project will be completed in the region within the next few months, and a published report will be available later this year. One of the data types used is airborne geophysics. In other parts of the U.S., the surveys use fixed-winged airplanes, but due to Southwestern Utah’s rugged terrain, the use of a helicopter is required.  The project includes the use of a Bell 206L3/AS350 helicopter. But why does it look like there’s a stinger attached to the front? “In this case, the helicopter is carrying a magnetometer and a series of crystals to measure the magnetic field that the rocks are emitting across the region,” Jones said. The survey looks for magnetic patterns to reveal information about the rocks themselves. The information obtained will help map the geology of the region more accurately, which is being done by the state of Utah. “They’re basically mowing the lawn out there,” he said about the project in Southern Utah. “They’ll move on to other areas. It’s definitely slow-going with the helicopters. They don’t cover as much ground as quickly as other methods.” According to the U.S. Geological Survey, flights will cover areas within Washington, Iron and Beaver counties. The flights will not include the reservation lands of the Paiute Tribe of Utah. The flights will be based out of Parowan Airport, Cedar City Regional Airport, Hurricane Mesa Airport, St. George Regional Airport and Lincoln County Airport. The helicopters will fly along pre-planned flight paths relatively low to the ground at about 300 feet above the surface. The ground clearance will be increased to 1,000 feet over populated areas and will comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations, Jones said. All the information gathered from the survey will be assembled into an updated story of the geologic history and mineral resource potential of the U.S. More information on USGS mineral resources research can be found at this link.

Thanks to the Department of Science and Technology, the foundation stone for the project will be laid by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday at Madikeri. Nestled across 3 acres of pristine land in Karnangeri village, the facility will feature an 8-meter dome for the construction of the planetarium. Minister of Minor Irrigation, Science and Technology N.S. Boseraju highlighted Madikeri’s unique advantage of minimal light disturbance at night, making it an ideal location for observing stars and planets. In a press statement, Mr. Boseraju, who is also the Minister in charge of Kodagu district, emphasised the department’s commitment to promoting science and technology, fostering scientific education, cultivating rational thinking, and raising awareness about astronomy. The initiative aims to establish science centers and planetariums across district centers in the State, he added. Kodagu district, with its unpolluted skies and minimal light interference, provides an exceptional environment for stargazing, the Minister said. Mr. Boseraju likened Kodagu to other picturesque locations such as Spiti Valley in Himachal Pradesh, Pangong Tso Lake in Ladakh, Run of Kutch in Gujarat, Nile Island in Andaman and Nicobar, and Matheran in Maharashtra. The sub-regional science center and planetarium project is envisioned to ignite interest in space exploration and provide students in the district with valuable educational opportunities, the statement said. Mr. Boseraju expressed optimism about the transformative impact of this initiative on the scientific landscape of the district.

			Trending:		 Next week my right hip joint celebrates its first birthday. No party is planned, but the anniversary will be marked by a visit to the person who placed it to make sure it is still happy and well-integrated in its pelvic confines. In one sense, it is a bit of a miracle: Apart from some numbness, there is no more pain from the movements of an older body — well, in that hip anyway. In another sense, it is disquieting: Its titanium presence is a nagging reminder that I — like each of us — am racing toward my ultimate bodily dissolution at the hands of entropy.  Science has many theories about aging, and many people are using those theories to invent new ways to try to slow or even stop the most visible effects of time. Most of these are fairly superficial: Slopping goop on the face, injecting toxins, sucking out cells and putting them somewhere else, ingesting something from jellyfish or plants, spackling cracks, a bit of runny hair dye, etc. A parade of TV commercials features pathologically cheerful people claiming to have beaten back aging through some kind of miracle product. And, yes, the users of these pseudo-scientific treatments might look better at the right camera angle in the right light. But their aging has not stopped, and the many more devastating diseases (Alzheimer’s, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, etc.) continue their stealthy development. The full extent of the deep molecular changes that cause us to age are still largely unknown. But if we could identify them, could we fix or at least slow them down? That is the thesis behind a research study that appeared last month in the top-tier scientific journal Nature (you can read it at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06802-1). A team of scientists used a powerful technology developed at a Boulder company formerly called SomaLogic (now merged with Standard BioTools) that accurately measures changes in thousands of proteins released into the blood by various tissues and organs around the body. Basically, a single blood test for a bunch of different diseases and conditions. The scientists were astoundingly successful in identifying patterns of changes in those proteins that define the onset and growth of many different aging diseases. These findings will almost certainly lead to a new flurry of more precisely targeted, less superficial anti-aging treatments. But entropy will still hold the winning hand. Although we are getting a better understanding of how we age, we are quite clueless about why we do. Yes, I know many philosophers and theologians and prophets over the centuries have offered answers, most of which have something to do with a higher power promising a better life after this one. How we fight this life’s battle to its literal death will determine how well-placed we are in the next life. One can’t scientifically disprove these consolatory teachings. But neither can they be proved, wh...",0

"UTME: 15,033 public school students benefit from Kogi govt’s free registration",2024-01-24T12:41:00+00:00,https://tribuneonlineng.com/utme-15033-public-school-students-benefit-from-kogi-govts-free-registration/,"The Kogi State Government, in line with its free education policy under Governor Yahaya Bello, has released the sum of one hundred and fifteen million naira (N115,000,000) to cover the cost of JAMB registration fees for 15,033 students in public schools across the state. The State Commissioner for Education, Science, and Technology, Hon. Wemmy Jones, disclosed this while briefing journalists in Lokoja, saying the gesture further demonstrates Governor Yahaya Bello’s commitment to giving all Kogi children free access to education. According to the Commissioner, the action is a follow-up to the earlier payment of about N497 million to WAEC to ensure no student in Kogi public schools is made to pay a dime before writing any internal or external examination. “I am pleased to announce to parents of Kogi students in public schools that they do not need to bother themselves about paying for their children’s JAMB registration fees as the Governor has already released funds for that purpose. “This is happening a few weeks after the State Government paid hundreds of millions of Naira to WAEC for the registration of thousands of students in public schools, further demonstrating the Governor’s determination to ensure no Kogi student is deprived of the chance to be educated on account of poverty. “Having surpassed the benchmark of UNESCO on education budgetary allocation, Kogi has continued to be a beautiful commentary on education for all,” he said. kogistate.gov.ng has also reported that all the students in public secondary schools across the state will be covered by the policy. The State Government, under the leadership of Governor Yahaya Bello, has strengthened education in the state with better education infrastructure, employment of qualified teachers, broadening technical education, and making education free for all. A parent, Mr. Adejoh Philip, thanked the Governor for the gesture, saying he will be remembered for laying a solid foundation for the renaissance of education in the state. “After seeing how beautiful the GYB Model Science Secondary School, Adankolo is, I withdrew my child from a private school and took him to the school. Many parents are doing the same. He has invested so much in the education of our children,” he said.

Trump’s 'immunity' argument is a recipe for a 'dark American future': former federal prosecutor,2024-01-24T12:21:36+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/trump-14th-amendment-2667074287/,"When the U.S. Supreme Court rejected special counsel Jack Smith's request for an expedited review of former President Donald Trump's ""presidential immunity"" argument, the justices weren't saying that they will never review the matter — only that they want to keep it in the lower federal courts for now.  Trump and his lawyers are arguing that because he was still president during the lame duck period of late 2020/early 2021, Smith's election interference case against him should be thrown out — as he enjoys ""immunity"" from prosecution. Judge Tanya Chutkan flat-out rejected that argument, ruling that U.S. presidents don't enjoy a ""divine right of kings"" in the United States. But the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has been reviewing Trump's ""immunity"" claim. In an op-ed published on January 24, the Daily Beast's Shan Wu — a former federal prosecutor — warns that Trump's ""immunity"" claim has dangerous implications that go way beyond Trump himself. POLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again? ""Let's make it simple: Presidents, police officers, and pedophile priests are not immune from criminal prosecution,"" Wu emphasizes. ""No court has ever ruled that they are. Nor does the Constitution grant such immunity. Trump appears to think that the doctrine of qualified immunity — which is a form of immunity that protects government officials, including police, judges, legislators, and prosecutors, from being sued civilly in lawsuits over the performance of their duties — also protects these categories of officials from criminal prosecutions. But he's wrong."" The former federal prosecutor continues, ""Qualified immunity does not protect anyone from criminal prosecutions. Quite to the contrary, President Richard M. Nixon resigned from the presidency because he feared that an indictment was imminent for his role in the Watergate case. His successor, President Gerald R. Ford, pardoned Nixon precisely because Nixon was not immune from criminal prosecution."" Wu argues that ""if police had the kind of immunity that Trump thinks he should have,"" former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin ""never would have been prosecuted at all"" for murdering George Floyd in 2020. ""Trump is not content to rest his fate upon the unspoken and often unseen biases that have protected the powerful from accountability,"" Wu writes. ""No, he wants to say the quiet part out loud by making it the law of the land that he cannot be prosecuted. This is the kind of dark American future Donald J. Trump seeks to keep himself out of jail.""

"Sustainable Carbon Removals Limits Identified, Huge Climate Mitigation Challenge Revealed",2024-02-01T23:17:49+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe8kCt6aCUXNFw3HFUzDTIP,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   By Eurasia Review  Governments and businesses are relying on dangerous amounts of future removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, instead of more rapidly reducing emissions and phasing out fossil fuels. This problem is partly due to an incomplete picture1 of the damaging consequences of carbon dioxide removal for people, food security and natural ecosystems, according to new research published in Science.  The paper finds that the carbon dioxide removal potential currently reported by the UN climate science assessment body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change2 (IPCC), greatly overestimates how much heavy lifting carbon dioxide removal, specifically bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and tree-planting, can safely do in the pursuit of climate targets. The IPCC works by synthesising the best available literature at the time of writing and publishing their reports. Scientific understanding of how to slow and halt global warming has become more sophisticated in recent years, allowing the researchers to now map carbon dioxide removal options against sustainability risks, to see what would keep to climate policy goals without posing unacceptable hazards. Lead author, Alexandra Deprez, IDDRI-Sciences Po said: “Governments and industries are banking on large future deployments of  carbon dioxide removal  to deliver the Paris Agreement climate goals, but the scale proposed threatens food security, human rights, poses serious damage to natural ecosystems and risks overstepping multiple planetary boundaries in potentially irreversible ways.” The researchers examined the published climate science that informed the most recent IPCC reports, and the pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C. They found the sustainable thresholds for land-based carbon dioxide removal3 using bioenergy crops, forestry and ecosystem restoration to be significantly lower than deployment expectations conveyed by most pathways presented in the IPCC reports, once biodiversity and human livelihoods risks4 are applied to the various scenarios. Co-author Prof. Paul Leadley, University of Paris-Saclay said: “The levels of carbon dioxide removal that are considered to be feasible at reasonable cost by the IPCC create high risks for agriculture, livelihoods and the environment. That’s because there isn’t enough land on our planet for huge amounts of carbon dioxide removal – something else has to give. Biodiversity, freshwater use, and food security should be the issues that guide limits to carbon dioxide removal rather than current estimates of technical and economic potentials.” The latest IPCC mitigation report (AR6 WGIII) deals with the issue of delivering against the Paris Agreement ambitious climate goals, in part by identifying the technical and economic limits to carbon dioxide removal options. The upper end of the proposed ceiling for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and afforestation/reforestation (maintaining, enhan...",0
Culling Animals Who ‘Don’t Belong’ Can Be A Flawed Nature Conservation Practice,2024-02-01T23:16:54+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWe8kCt6aCUXNIfjc6hd5eWF,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   By Eurasia Review  New research published in the journal Science has concluded that eradicating animals on the basis that they are not native in order to protect plant species, can be a flawed practice costing millions of dollars, and resulting in the slaughter of millions of healthy wild animals. Introduced large herbivores, or megafauna, are claimed to have distinct and harmful ecological impacts, including damaging sensitive plants and habitats, reducing native plant diversity, and facilitating introduced plants. However, up to now these impacts have been studied without comparison to a proper control: native megafauna. The new analysis, carried out by researchers at Aarhus University, Denmark, and the University of Oxford, UK, compared the effects of large mammal species listed as native and introduced, respectively, in 221 studies from across the world. They found that the two groups of animals had indistinguishable effects on both the abundance and diversity of native plants. Study co-author Dr Jeppe Kristensen (The Environmental Change Institute, University of Oxford), said: ‘We do not find evidence to support the claim that native large herbivores have different impacts on ecosystems, specifically plant communities in this case, than their non-native counterparts. Therefore, we should study the ecological roles these animals – native or not – play in ecosystems rather than judge them based on their belonging.’ However, the researchers did find that the traits of megafauna influenced how they affect plants, regardless of nativeness. In particular, small-bodied picky-eaters, such as deer, tended to suppress plant diversity while larger, generalist bulk-feeders such as buffalo tended to increase plant diversity. This is because large, bulk-feeders are physically unable to selectively feed on their favourite plants and are therefore more likely to suppress dominant species, making space for smaller sub-dominant plant species. The researchers also found that the body mass of individual animals had a significant effect, but not the combined weight of animals on the landscape. This testifies to the unique effects of large and very large animals, compared with smaller animals. Dr Kristensen added: ‘While one elephant can push over a mid-sized tree, 50 red deer cannot. You can’t total the body mass to understand the effect of animal presence on the landscape, you have to consider the effect of each animal species present.’ The authors point out that the study specifically assessed large mammal herbivores, and that nativeness may remain an important way to understand other types of ecological interactions. For instance, more specialised introduced species such as introduced tree pests, may have really distinct effects on ecosystems because native species did not coevolve with them. Millions of dollars are spent eradicating animals each year due to our perception of them not belonging in a certain place. Paradoxical...",0
Relocated Songbirds Can Successfully Learn The Diversity Of Song They Need To Survive,2024-02-01T23:13:46+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdRgSvwNEyLaUGT5aWO9DEx,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   A new study explored how Cirl buntings relocated as part of conservation programmes can successfully learn the song repertoires they need to communicate – and ultimately survive – in the wild CREDIT: Ben Andrew (rspb-images.com) By Eurasia Review  Nestling songbirds relocated as part of conservation programmes successfully learn the song repertoires they need to communicate – and ultimately survive – in the wild, a new study has found. The research, published in the journal Conservation Science and Practice, is the first to follow translocated songbird chicks over time to assess their song development. It focused on populations of cirl buntings (Emberiza cirlus), taken from a number of sites in Devon before being hand-reared and then reintroduced in Cornwall as part of a major programme co-ordinated by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) between 2006 and 2011. Cirl buntings are songbirds, which means they need to learn their songs from adult tutors and the relocated birds were all chicks that were hand-reared. As a result, in addition to RSPB officers examining the overall success of the conservation programme, scientists recorded the birds’ song to assess the song repertoires of the relocated birds. Recordings at the release site in Cornwall in 2011 showed the population contained a reduced number of song types and individuals sang a wide range of abnormal song types, all very different to the source populations in Devon. This was not that surprising given they had only had a CD with a single cirl bunting song played to them while being hand-reared. However, on following up in 2019 the Cornwall population’s song repertoire had reached similar levels to the source populations in Devon, with song types also typical to those found within other cirl bunting populations. This showed that despite an issue with the songs produced in 2011, termed by scientists as a cultural bottleneck, the population recovered as it increased in size. It also suggests that if the translocation of nestlings is deemed necessary for conservation purposes, it may not lead to long-term problems for communication and population persistence. The research was carried out by conservation experts at the University of Plymouth, the RSPB, and Manchester Metropolitan University. Dr Sarah Collins, Associate Professor in Animal Behaviour and Welfare at the University of Plymouth, is the study’s lead author. She said: “Song diversity is a crucial feature among songbird populations, and although it has been examined as part of relocation or reintroduction programmes in the past, there were no studies on what happens when you translocate nestling songbirds before they have had a chance to learn their song. Although we found translocating nestlings led to a short-term lack of song diversity, the population recovered from this to produce normal songs. “This is ultimately a positive conservation story that we can learn from for the future. ...",0

Greta Thunberg and eco-activists stage protest at Science Museum over 'oil and gas sponsorship',2024-02-01T22:37:10+00:00,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/greta-thunberg-science-museum-sponsorship-adani-protest-b1136502.html,"News | London Eco protesters including Greta Thunberg staged a demonstration at the Science Museum on Thursday evening in a row over fossil fuel sponsorship. Extinction Rebellion protesters hung banners reading: “2024, more droughts and floods - fuelled by Science Museum oil and gas sponsors” at a late opening of the renowned South Kensington museum. The activists unfurled banners at a panel talk organised at the event on predictions for 2024, chaired by University Challenge contestant, Bobby Seagull. On social media, an Extinction Rebellion-affiliated group, Scientists For XR, said the action was taken against the Adani sponsorship of the ‘Energy Revolution’ gallery due to open this spring. The gallery will explore “how we can journey to a more sustainable future,” according to the Science Museum website.  Critics claim Adani's fossil fuel operations are fuelling the climate crisis and are at odds with the gallery’s aims. The group also handed out leaflets criticising the museum’s past sponsorship deals with oil and gas firms, BP and Equinor. However, the museum says the sponsorship is solely with Adani Green Energy, a renewables-focused subsidiary. It has also previously said that it ""retains editorial control"" within its galleries and exhibitions in any deals signed. In footage posted from the event, Ms Thunberg can be heard to say: “It is about time to practise what you preach … Adani recently invested sixteen billion dollars in a new Australian coal mine. Is that what you stand for at the Science Museum?” Headteachers ‘should not authorise pupil absences for protests on school days’ Low traffic neighbourhood in Lambeth suspended after 'causing huge problems' White foam in Thames 'was natural occurrence not sewage' says Environment Agency Meet the fitness influencer defying stereotypes about ageing One onlooker, who did not wish to be named, said: “A group of protesters were walking around chanting about the Science Museum’s relationship with oil and gas sponsors, there was a very long queue to get in.” A Science Museum spokesperson said: ""During the evening there was a peaceful protest by Greta Thunberg and a small group of activists which colleagues responded to with great professionalism.  ""Discussion, debate and at times disagreement are all part of how a democracy approaches critical issues such as climate change, which is at the core of our mission and many of the talks we organise.’ The 21-year-old from Sweden earlier on Thursday appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court after being arrested during a demonstration near the InterContinental Hotel in Mayfair on October 17. Earlier this week, Ms Thunberg also joined climate change campaigners outside Farnborough Airport to protest against plans to increase private jet flights from 50,000 to 70,000 a year.  MORE ABOUT Have your say... 1 Lifestyle Where did it all go so wrong for oat milk? 2 Football PSG vs Barcelona LIVE!

This Palm-Reading Smart Lock Is Straight Out Of Science Fiction,2024-02-01T22:15:52+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1502679/palm-reading-smart-lock-out-of-science-fiction/,"
The ability to open a home door by simply waving your hand has been a human dream for about as long as doors and hands have existed, and Philips is bringing that reality a little closer with its touch-free palm reading system. You don't even have to say ""Open sesame."" At CES 2024, Philips previewed a smart deadbolt that automatically scans your unique palm print and unlocks, likely impressing anyone with you at the time. However, you'll still have to push open the door yourself.





No keys, codes, or palm-reading fortune tellers are needed. According to Philips, the smart lock uses a palm vein reader that can automatically detect and scan a person's unique palm vein pattern, even if it's a little dirty after a long day at work. Philips claims the lock can register up to 50 palm patterns, with the ability to scan hands from people of all ages.

For those not looking to abracadabra their way inside, the smart deadbolt still allows you to unlock it using a PIN, voice commands, the Philips Home Access mobile app, or, God forbid, an actual key. But the magic isn't limited to the front of the door. Inside, the lock can detect your approach with built-in proximity sensors, so when users reach towards the doorknob, it registers your presence and unlocks.

Maincaland bee project to empower 2 000 farmers,2024-02-01T22:06:13+00:00,https://www.herald.co.zw/maincaland-bee-project-to-empower-2-000-farmers/,"s Tariro Stacey Gatsi SEVENTY farmers from Mutasa South, Manicaland have received bee keeping training under a Forestry Commission initiative targeting to equip 2 000 individuals with skills for sustainable bee farming to capacitate them to generate additional incomes. Also known as apiculture, bee-keeping is the art, business and science of rearing honey bees for production of honey and its valuable by-products while a bee hive is a habitation constructed for bees, usually either dome-shaped or box-shaped. In a recent X (formerly twitter) post, Manicaland Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution Advocate Misheck Mugadza last week revealed that he had attended a bee hive making, bee keeping and honey making gala in Mutasa South Constituency. “Over 70 participants got equipped with skills by trainers from the Forestry Commission. At least 2 000 people are expected to undergo the training and each trainee is expected to make at least ten hives to kick-start their projects,” said Adv Mugadza. For Zimbabwe to become a significant player in the export of natural honey, there is need to improve infrastructure facilities with modern hives that have a longer shelf life than the traditional ones being used by some farmers, he observed. Forestry Commission’s Information and Communications manager Ms Violet Makoto said their commitment to community empowerment and environmental sustainability had been demonstrated through the partnership with local stakeholders, including Allied Timbers, which provided bee hives. The collaboration has allowed the implementation of comprehensive bee keeping training programmes, equipping participants with the necessary skills to engage in bee hive making, she added. Bee keeping is a non-consumptive use of the resource. “As the Forestry Commission rolls out beekeeping projects in communities, particularly in rural areas, we recognise that bee keeping provides a good incentive towards forest conservation,” said Ms Makoto Bee keeping has proved to be an ideal livelihood enhancement option, which has the positive effect of providing an income stream for communities in both urban and rural communities through sale of honey and its by-products like beeswax, propolis and royal jelly. This consequently makes bee keeping a good project for communities to earn extra income over and above their other projects. “There are mutual benefits to the farmers (as they derive income for livelihood enhancement through the sale of honey and other bee keeping products) and the forest conservation agenda as farmers intensify their efforts to protect the forest from which their bees forage,” said Ms Makoto. She added that the apiculture training offered by the Forestry Commission placed emphasis on sustainable ways of bee keeping, which encompass the use of modern beehives like the Kenyan Top Bar (KTB) and Langstroth hives. For Zimbabwe to become a significant player in the export of natural honey, there is need to replace traditional...",0

 Lifestyle * In a rather surprising reaction, Robbie said that she was not sad about it but felt Gerwig should have been nominated for Best Director News Desk February 2, 2024  Actor and producer Margot Robbie of ‘Barbie’ has finally responded to her and director Greta Gerwig’s snub from Oscars 2024 nominations. Days after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the nominations for Oscar Awards 2024, featuring some major surprises and snubs, which created a social media uproar from fans and fraternity alike, Hollywood star Margot Robbie has now reacted to her and Gerwig’s omission from the nods. In a rather surprising reaction, Robbie said that she was not sad about it but felt Gerwig should have been nominated for Best Director. “There’s no way to feel sad when you know you’re this blessed,” said the ‘Barbie’ star. “Obviously, I think Greta should be nominated as a director. What she did is a once-in-a-career, once-in-a-lifetime thing. What she pulled off, it really is. But it’s been an incredible year for all the films.” Pertinent to note that the title snagged eight nominations in total, including for Gerwig in the Best-adapted Screenplay category and Robbie as co-producer of Best Picture. Meanwhile, Gosling, who played Ken, has been nominated for best supporting actor. Reacting to the nods, Robbie said that she is ‘beyond ecstatic’ for all the nominees associated with the film. She said, “Everyone getting the nods that they’ve had is just incredible, and the best picture nod. We set out to do something that would shift culture, affect culture, just make some sort of impact. And it’s already done that and some, way more than we ever dreamed it would. And that is truly the biggest reward that could come out of all of this. People’s reactions to the movie have been the biggest reward of this entire experience. Whether it’s seeing what people are writing online, or even just seeing how much pink I can see in this room right now I’ve never been a part of something like this. Not like this.” “I’ve done comic book stuff and that gets a big reaction, but this felt very different. It still feels very different. And I can’t think of a time when a movie had this effect on culture. And it’s amazing to be in the eye of the storm,” Robbie explained.

"Bugs aren’t in love with your lightbulbs, new study finds",2024-02-01T19:15:54+00:00,https://www.deseret.com/2024/2/1/24058089/insects-lights-study,"It’s a familiar sight: bugs flying around the lamp posts, your kitchen light and anything else using a light bulb. It can be annoying — and scientists are wondering why it happens. A new study published in the journal Nature Communications sought to get 3D flight data from insects, something that hasn’t been done before. And its findings might surprise you.  Before this study, science had to rely on theories such as lunar navigation, where it was believed insects used light from the moon and stars to navigate, according to Business Insider.  Smithsonian Magazine explains that this study expanded on lunar navigation, where insects will turn their backs to the sky where light is emanating, a method that helps them know which way is up and down.  The study’s team went to Costa Rica, where they used high-resolution cameras to film insects flying around artificial lights; they also attached motion sensors to certain insects back at the lab to create a “motion-capture” of their movements, according to The Associated Press.  A common misconception people have is that bugs fly around artificial light because they’re attracted to it. But according to the study, insects will turn their backs to the lights, believing it is a moon or star above them, thus confusing them and trapping them in a never-ending orbit. According to the study, some insects will turn upside down and crash-land in the presence of lights that beam up to the sky, according to AP.  Scientists hope that this research can help reduce the damage from light pollution, a human-made phenomenon that has had negative impacts on animals, humans and star visibility, according to Smithsonian Magazine.  People can start using lights that point straight down instead of up to reduce the number of insects flying to it, per Smithsonian Magazine. Professor Gareth Jones from the University of Bristol suggests using light bulbs that have shorter wavelengths, such as UV light, that are less attractive to bugs, per The Guardian.  Scientists hope that if we can change the way our artificial lights impact insects, it will improve their life cycles.  “Maybe they’re not finding mates the way they should. Maybe they’re not finding the food resources the way they should,” Peter Oboyski, executive director at the Essig Museum of Entomology, said to Business Insider. ",0

Pig brain survives outside body for hours. Are humans next?,2024-02-01T18:32:44+00:00,https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/pig-brain-survives-outside-body-for-hours-are-humans-next/,"Home → Science → News Scientists kept a pig's brain alive outside its body for five hours, challenging the boundaries between life, technology, and the future of human consciousness."" A common motif in science fiction is the ‘brain in a vat’. In such a scenario, a person’s brain is suspended in a life-sustaining vat and connected to a supercomputer that provides it with electrical impulses identical to those it would receive were it inhabiting a real, physical body. The brain, thus deceived, experiences a simulated reality indistinguishable from the real thing. The brain in a vat is an interesting thought experiment meant to probe and challenge our understanding of consciousness — or even, dare I say it, the very notion of ‘truth’ — and how it may intersect in the future with technology. However, more recently, this concept has crossed outside of the realm of philosophy. Neuroscientists and engineers are increasingly adept at interfacing the human brain with computers, leading to breakthroughs in prosthetics and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) controlled by a patient’s thoughts. Then there’s a whole AI thing, which simulates neural networks within computers. But what scientists at the University of Texas (UT) Southwestern Medical Center recently did took it a step further.  For the first time, a pig’s brain was kept alive outside of its body for a full five hours. Blood carrying vital oxygen was kept circulating through the isolated brain using a so-called extracorporeal pulsatile circulatory control (EPCC) device.  “This novel method enables research that focuses on the brain independent of the body, allowing us to answer physiological questions in a way that has never been done,” said Dr. Juan Pascual, study leader and a Professor of Neurology, Pediatrics, and Physiology at the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development at UT Southwestern.  This device not only paves the way for studying the human brain without the interference of other bodily functions but could also inspire the design of more sophisticated cardiopulmonary bypass machines that mimic natural blood flow to the brain more closely. The brain, being the control center for numerous bodily processes such as heart rate, breathing, and the sleep-wake cycle, is significantly influenced by various physiological factors like blood sugar, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. Developing a device that can isolate the brain from these bodily influences is a monumental step forward. By redirecting the brain’s blood supply through a pump that can regulate variables including pressure, volume, temperature, oxygenation, and nutrients, the researchers have managed to maintain stable brain activity over extensive periods. This isolation allows for precise manipulation of inputs to the brain, facilitating a clearer understanding of how these inputs affect brain function without the body’s interference. For instance, Dr. Pascual and his team have leveraged this technology to gain insight...",0

                WRIGHT-PATTERSON AIR FORCE BASE, OHIO (AFRL) — The Air Force Research Laboratory, or AFRL, the National Science Foundation, or NSF, and representatives from some of the nation’s leading academic institutions joined forces at the Wright Brothers Institute in downtown Dayton, Ohio, for the NSF’s Designing Materials to Revolutionize our Future, or DMREF, and AFRL Kickoff Dec. 6-7, 2023.  
The two-day event provided a rare opportunity for members of AFRL’s world-class science and technology, or S&T, workforce to share scientific plans with fellow materials researchers from some of the country’s most distinguished universities to accelerate the transition of new materials from design to deployment in support of the nation’s warfighters over the next four years. 

Twenty-two multidisciplinary materials research teams attended the event, representing multiple principal investigators from a wide range of multi-university projects. The teams’ research projects are funded wholly or in part by a series of grants awarded in 2021 and 2023 through the NSF’s DMREF program to help support the discovery, development and deployment of new materials more quickly and efficiently at a fraction of the typical cost, many in support of the warfighter.  

Of the 37 new four-year projects funded in the 2023 DMREF awards cycle, seven are directly tied to AFRL directorates. Roughly a third of the NSF’s DMREF current portfolio, comprised of materials research grants awarded in 2021 and 2023, involve collabora...",0

UNIMED offers automatic employment to three best graduating students,2024-02-01T17:43:50+00:00,https://tribuneonlineng.com/unimed-offers-automatic-employment-to-three-best-graduating-students/,"The University of Medical Science (UNIMED) in Ondo State has offered automatic employment to its top three graduating students in the 2022/2023 academic session. The Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof. Adesegun Fatusi, announced the offer during the institution’s 5th convocation ceremony, expressing the institution’s commitment to supporting the beneficiaries in pursuing further education. The beneficiaries include Miss Francisca Ademulegun, who achieved a First Class in Physiology, Miss Mercy Saba, the best female graduating student, and Michael Aremu, the best male graduating student. Prof Fatusi revealed that the first set of physicians from the institution was produced in record time, describing this achievement as unprecedented in the history of Nigeria. The UNIMED VC emphasized that African medicine is the key to unlocking opportunities for Nigeria and Africa to make significant contributions to drug development and health advancement globally. However, he noted that the institution would not relent in its effort to promote the advancement of African herbal medicine, stating that it’s high time to end the inexcusable neglect of Africa’s God-given heritage’s vast and untapped potential. Prof. Fatusi called on the state government to provide special attention and intervention funds to accelerate development in the institution, saying, “The government needs to ensure that UNIMED continues to be a TETFUND beneficiary institution. So far, TETFUND has been the main funding source for UNIMED’s infrastructural deficits. As a specialised university, UNIMED has the highest need for developmental projects and resources.” He reported that out of 528 graduates, 19 obtained first-class degrees, 217 achieved Second Class upper, 94 earned second-class lower, and 15 were awarded third class honours. Governor Lucky Ayedatiwa mentioned that the sum of N1 billion has been earmarked for the construction of a Senate building at the main campus of the institution. He expressed his administration’s commitment to the continuous growth and success of the university, commending the institution’s leadership and stakeholders for their collective efforts and support in advancing medical education in Ondo State. During the convocation lecture, Chief Executive Officer of Background Check International, Kola Olugbodi, advised the graduates to seek opportunities in the untapped potentials for innovation within the country. He urged the young graduates to view economic difficulties as a canvas for creativity and finding novel solutions to enhance healthcare delivery. Olugbodi stated, “There are lots of good things happening in Nigeria. Anytime you see a society where things are not working, that is a society with lots of opportunities. There are opportunities here. Let’s stay here. We have entered into the age of entrepreneurship. Begin to think entrepreneurship.” The Pro Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council of the University, Prof Ayodele Arowojolu, highlig...",0
"Cygnus spacecraft arrives at space station with 8,200 pounds of cargo",2024-02-01T17:41:05+00:00,https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2024/02/01/Cygnus-International-Space-Station-cargo/3471706808313/,"


Feb. 1 (UPI) -- The International Space Station received more than 8,200 pounds of supplies and science experiments on Thursday after Northrup Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft successfully docked with the orbiting laboratory.
NASA astronaut Loral O'Hara snared the spaceship with the ISS's robotic arm to complete the docking with fellow astronaut Jasmin Moghbeli serving as a backup, NASA said.

Cygnus launched from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station on Tuesday for its ride to the space station.
One of the numerous experiments taken to the space station will be the testing of 3D printing in space, particularly making small metal products in microgravity. The test could be useful in long-term trips to the moon and Mars where running out to the hardware store may prove difficult.
""This investigation provides us with an initial understanding of how such a printer behaves in space,"" said the European Space Agency's Rob Postema, according to Space.com. ""A 3D printer can create many shapes, and we plan to print specimens, first to understand how printing in space may differ from printing on Earth.
""Second, to see what types of shapes we can print with this technology. In addition, this activity helps show how crewmembers can work safely and efficiently with printing metal parts in space.""

Thursday's arrival marked the 20th Northrop Grumman trip to the International Space Station.
The Cygnus will stay attached to the ISS until May when it will back toward Earth and burn up in the atmosphere.

Probabl is a new AI company built around popular library scikit-learn,2024-02-01T16:59:04+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/probabl-is-a-new-ai-company-built-around-popular-library-scikit-learn/,"Probabl isn’t your average AI startup, as this new French company is an Inria spin-off company that revolves around an open source data science library called scikit-learn — Inria is a well-known French technology research institute. As for scikit-learn, with more than 45,000 stars on GitHub, this Python module is widely used by machine learning teams working on tabular data. It can be used for model fitting, predicting, cross-validation, etc. Unless you’re an ML developer, this might be the first time you’re hearing about scikit-learn. But many big companies have relied on the library for their own products, such as Spotify, Hugging Face, Booking.com and Dataiku. Some of the contributors behind scikit-learn and other Inria-backed open source libraries have decided to create a company to ensure that these projects remain actively developed and properly funded with revenue-making activities. Researchers who are joining this project include Camille Troillard, Gaël Varoquaux, Olivier Grisel, François Goupil, Guillaume Lemaitre, Jérémie Du Boisberranger and Fabien Gandon. Yann Lechelle, the former CEO of cloud hosting company Scaleway, spent four months as Entrepreneur in Residence at Inria working on this project. Following the spin-off from Inria, he will assume the role of CEO of Probabl. “We are a software publisher, but our first commercial offerings will include professional services, training and certification, specifically around scikit-learn,” Lechelle told me. “Our scope will be broader to cover the complete data cycle from organization and cleaning to machine learning and MLOps.” As a company, Probabl now has three types of shareholders: They will all play a part in the governing body of the newly formed organization. Probabl is calling itself a company with an industrial and digital sovereignty mission. As a result, it wants to release truly open source projects, which hasn’t been the case lately in the AI industry.",0
"Proposed Canadian AI law is like a race car without an engine, expert tells Parliamentary committee",2024-02-01T16:43:03+00:00,https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/proposed-canadian-ai-law-is-like-a-race-car-without-an-engine-expert-tells-parliamentary-committee/557818,"Videos PodcastsBlogsSlideshows The Liberal government’s proposed law controlling the use of artificial intelligence applications is like a badly built racing car, a computing expert has told a Parliamentary committee. But instead of putting the proposed Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA) in a garage, Andrew Clement, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto’s faculty of information, told the Commons industry committee Wednesday that the government should start all over again, with proper public consultation including a wide range of Canadians. Innovation Minister François-Philippe Champagne, the bill’s sponsor, “wants to make Canada a world leader in AI governance. That’s a fine goal. But it’s as if we’re in an International Grand Prix,” Clement said. “Apparently to allay the fears of Canadians, he proudly entered a made-in-Canada contender. Beyond the proud Maple Leaf and him smiling at the wheel, his AIDA vehicle barely has a chassis and an engine.” “He insisted he was merely being ‘agile,’ promising that if you just help propel him over the finish line, all will be fixed through regulations.” But, Clement said, as a previous witness testified, there is no prize for first place in AI oversight. “Good governance isn’t a race, but an ongoing learning project.” Among the problems: The Innovation Minister would have “sweeping powers,” Clement said, which puts him in conflict with his job to advance the AI industry. And the proposed AI data commissioner for overseeing the law should be an independent officer of Parliament, he said, not someone who, as the bill proposed, would report to the Innovation Minister. “With so much uncertainty about the perils and promise of AI, public consultation with informed expertise is a vital precondition for establishing a sound legal foundation,” Clement added. But while Champagne said his department held more than 300 meetings, by Clement’s count, 220 were with businesses, including 36 with U.S. tech giants. Only nine were with civil society representing Canadians. “Canada also needs to carefully study developments in the E.U., U.S., and elsewhere, before settling on its own approach,” Clement said. Asked by one MP if AIDA in its current form would protect Canadians, Clement replied “I would say not.” AIDA demands businesses deploying “high impact” AI technologies to use them responsibly. In particular they would have to develop and deploy applications in a way that mitigates the risks of harm and bias. There would be criminal prohibitions and penalties for using data obtained unlawfully for AI development, where the reckless deployment of AI poses serious harm, and where there is fraudulent intent to cause substantial economic loss through its deployment. Clement is the latest witness to call AIDA flawed and say it has to be sent back to the drawing board. The Information Technology Industry Council filed a brief telling MPs that more consultation is needed but also recommended wording changes. Lor...",0

You may be eating predigested food. Here’s why,2024-02-01T16:17:02+00:00,https://kesq.com/health/cnn-health/2024/02/01/you-may-be-eating-predigested-food-heres-why/," By Sandee LaMotte, CNN (CNN) — Why do many people overeat chips, cereals, cakes, puddings and other ultraprocessed foods despite knowing those foods may not be healthy? According to emerging science, it may be due to manufacturing processes that “predigest” raw food ingredients — creating ultraprocessed foods that bypass the body’s signals of fullness. You read that right: We are eating predigested food. What does “predigested” mean? To manufacture cheap, delicious food that is packaged for convenience, basic food crops such as corn, wheat and potatoes are dissembled into their molecular parts — starchy flours, protein isolates, fats and oils — or what manufacturers call “slurries.” “The bulk of what is extracted is starch slurry, a milky mixture of starch and water, but we also have extracted proteins and fibers,” according to a video explanation of the process from Starch Europe, part of the European Starch Industry Association. “Roughly half of the starch slurry goes to produce starch-based sugars and other derivatives,” the video says. “Those are created by hydrolysis, a process similar to human digestion.” Next, with the help of artificial colorings, flavorings and glue-like emulsifiers, those slurries are then heated, pounded, shaped or extruded into any food a manufacturer can dream up. Add in just the right ratio of sugar, salt and fat designed to tickle our taste buds, and an ultraprocessed food that’s nearly irresistible is born, said infectious disease specialist Dr. Chris van Tulleken, an associate professor at University College London. “It could be a pizza if you put some cheese and tomato on top. It could be a burger bun. It could be a grain bar, a breakfast cereal, ice cream or confectionery — they all have the same list of basic starting ingredients,” said van Tulleken, a BBC contributor who authored the 2023 book “Ultra-Processed People: Why Do We All Eat Stuff That Isn’t Food … and Why Can’t We Stop?” “It’s an illusion of food,” he added. “But it’s really expensive and difficult for a food company to make food that is real and whole, and much cheaper for food companies to destroy real foods, turn them in molecules, and then reassemble those to make anything they want.” Bypassing the digestive system
 Much like the regurgitated food mother birds feed their babies in the nest, ultraprocessed food is quick and easy to digest, according to experts. But that’s not how the human digestive system was meant to work. Starting with teeth designed to tear food apart, the human gastrointestinal system evolved to break down whole foods into their various nutritional components, absorb those vitamins, minerals and micronutrients and then eliminate the undigestible leftovers and fiber as stool. When food moves through the digestive system in ways Mother Nature didn’t intend, however, the body loses the ability to send a signal of fullness to the brain, said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine who founded the non...",0

Which dog breeds live the longest? Science has the answer,2024-02-01T16:00:00+00:00,https://metro.co.uk/2024/02/01/dog-breeds-live-longest-science-answer-20208916/,"NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT We all want our beloved companions to live forever, but which dogs enjoy the most years? Small, long-nosed dogs – such as whippets and miniature dachshunds – live the longest, according to a new study. But male dogs from medium-sized flat-faced breeds – such as English Bulldogs – have the lowest life expectancy, according to the findings. And female dogs had a slightly higher average life expectancy at 12.7 years compared to males at 12.4 years in the UK. The study, conducted by the Dogs Trust, found that small long-nosed – or ‘dolichocephalic’– breeds have the highest life expectancies, but medium-sized flat-faced – or ‘brachycephalic’ – breeds have the lowest. The results, published in the journal Scientific Reports, have been calculated from data on more than 580,000 individual dogs from over 150 different breeds. Researchers hope it could help to identify those dogs most at risk of an early death. Dr Kirsten McMillan, of the Dogs Trust, and her colleagues compiled a database of 584,734 individual dogs using data from 18 different UK sources – including breed registries, vets, pet insurance companies, animal welfare charities, and academic institutions. ‘Dogs were from one of 155 pure breeds or classified as a crossbreed, and 284,734 of the dogs had died before being added to the database,’ said Dr McMillan. ‘Breed, sex, date of birth, and date of death – if applicable – were included for all dogs. ‘Purebred dogs were assigned to size – small, medium, or large – and head shape – brachycephalic or short-nosed, mesocephalic or medium-nosed, and dolichocephalic or long-nosed – categories based on Kennel Club literature. California on alert as San Andreas fault hints at a quake Sky broadband is down with hundreds unable to connect to the internet Huge 'globster' sea creature washes up on beach Privacy is 'virtually impossible' on iPhones, experts warn ‘The median [average] life expectancy was then calculated for all breeds individually and for the crossbreed group, then finally for each combination of sex, size, and head shape.’ Small dolichocephalic breeds of both sexes – such as miniature dachshunds and Shetland Sheepdogs – had the highest median life expectancies of 13.3 years, according to the findings. But medium brachycephalic breeds had the lowest median life expectancies, of 9.1 years for males and 9.6 years for females. Dr McMillan added: ‘Among the 12 most popular breeds, which accounted for more than 50% of all recorded pure breeds in the database, labradors had a median life expectancy of 13.1 years, Jack Russell terriers had a median life expectancy of 13.3 years, and Cavalier King Charles spaniels had a median life expectancy of 11.8 years. ‘Pure breeds had a higher median life expectancy than crossbreeds – 12.7 years compared to 12.0 years – while female dogs had a slightly higher median life expectancy than males, at 12.7 years compared to 12.4 years.’ The research team said that their results are rep...",0

Intelligence doesn’t make you immune to conspiracy theories – it’s more about thinking style,2024-02-01T15:51:52+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/conspiracy-theory-2667145391/,"Over the last two decades, and in particular over the last five years, there has been a growing scientific interest in conspiracy theories and people who believe in them. Although, some may think belief in such stories is linked to intelligence, research is beginning to show that how people think could be more important. Scientists agree that having a measure of skepticism about official accounts of events is healthy and important, but conspiracy theorising can lead to dangerous consequences for the individual and for society.  Some conspiracy theories, for example the QAnon conspiracy, can be considered a minority belief, with a 2021 YouGov poll showing that 8% of those polled in the UK endorsed this conspiracy theory. However, some beliefs are more widespread. A 2018 survey of people from around Europe found 60% of British participants endorsed at least one conspiracy theory. So, who are the people who are more susceptible to conspiracy theorising?  There is a dramatically growing body of research endeavouring to understand this question. First, let’s re-examine those assumptions about who engages with conspiracy theories. People with high education levels, such as doctors and nurses, have been reported to propagate conspiracy theories. So it’s not just about intelligence – education won’t necessarily make you immune.  Research shows that our thinking style can be predictive of susceptibility to conspiracy theories. The dual processing theory of cognitive style suggests that we have two routes which we can use to process information.  One route is the fast, intuitive route which leans more on personal experiences and gut feelings. The other route is a slower, more analytical route which instead relies on elaborative and detailed processing of information.                Conspiracy theory belief seems to be linked to thinking style. philippgehrke.de/Shutterstock What you tend to see is that people who are not necessarily smarter but who favour the more effortful, analytical thinking style are more resistant to conspiracy beliefs. For example, a British 2014 study found that those who scored highly for questions such as “I enjoy problems that require hard thinking” were less likely to accept conspiracy beliefs. It also found those who were less likely to engage in effortful thinking styles and more likely to use intuitive thinking showed a higher belief in conspiracy theories.  Similarly, a 2022 study across 45 countries used a cognitive reflection test, which measured engagement in analytical thinking in three questions. It found that participants who engaged in the labour intensive thinking style were less likely to endorse COVID 19 conspiracy theories. Critical thinking is a valuable skill, particularly within education, and has been shown to buffer susceptibility to conspiracy beliefs. This is probably because this more arduous thinking style allows people time to identify inconsistencies in theories and look to additional resources to verify...",0

Rhizome’s 7×7 Models a Deeper Collaboration Between Art and Science,2024-02-09T22:29:01+00:00,https://observer.com/2024/02/art-technology-science-rhizome-seven-on-seven-2024/,"The intersection of art and technology gets a lot of press these days. In any given headline, it might be the “next frontier.” Or where cultural innovation happens. On some days, it’s spawning new job titles (e.g., curator of digital initiatives). And it always feels bright and shiny and optimistic and most importantly, new, even though artists have been experimenting with new technologies since the dawn of technology itself.

You can opt out anytime.				 And therein lies the challenge one faces when considering what exactly is happening at this much-publicized intersection. On one hand, the phrase is applied, seemingly broadly, to everything from NFTs and the ever-morphing works of Refik Anadol to the kinds of immersive installations pioneered by Sandro Kereselidze’s Artechouse. On the other, what reportedly exists at the intersection of art and technology seems strangely circumscribed. There’s computer-generated art and art inspired by technology at these crossroads but very little science. Or to put it another way, it seems there’s a lot more digital art being created at the intersection of the arts and technology than there are radical pairings of art and science. It may come down to people simply being more open to art borrowing from science and engineering than the reverse, even though there are plenty of notable examples of art inspiring scientific discovery. Niels Bohr in his development of the non-intuitive complementarity principle of quantum mechanics, for example, drew inspiration from Jean Metzinger’s cubist works. Claims that the dividing line between science and art is artificial come off as hyperbolic, but both scientists and artists are dreamers who channel their creative energies into untangling the world’s mysteries and building new things. It’s logical to consider what the intersection of art and technology could look like if the focus was on deep collaboration instead of just tapping into one or the other as a source of inspiration. On a Saturday in late January, scientists, engineers, artists and the curious gathered at the New Museum in New York City for the relaunch of Seven on Seven (7×7), an event born out of a 2010 hackathon that paired seven engineers with seven artists to demonstrate what could happen when they worked together. The lineup of past participants is a fascinating who’s who of art and tech: Tumblr founder David Karp, Internet entrepreneur Jonah Peretti and Aza Raskin of the Center for Humane Technology… new media artist Tabita Rezaire, moving image artist Hito Steyerl and performance and installation artist Martine Syms.

Science Natural Supplements Reviewed – Quality Health Products or Cheap Brand?,2024-02-09T19:56:15+00:00,https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2024/02/09/science-natural-supplements-reviewed-quality-health-products-or-cheap-brand/,"e-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters e-Edition Science Natural Supplements is a wellness brand that offers multiple supplements, supporting the improvements in health for consumers everywhere. It is one of the most reliable supplement brands, helping users improve their brain health, reduce inflammation, and more. Developed by Cody Bramlett, Science Natural Supplements provides consumers with many options to improve their health. While the platform was initially used to help people find natural solutions for their pain, the product line continues to grow, offering different solutions for different health and wellness concerns. Science Natural Supplements was initially developed to help the creator find relief. While other formulas did not suffice when he needed to soothe his pain, he decided to take the time to research the ingredients that might help him. After diving deep into clinical trials and scientific research, the information he learned made it possible for him to transform his own life, which is why he now uses the legacy of Science Natural Supplements to help others. The product line grew by one ingredient at a time. Cody started by focusing on inflammation, a significant concern for his father. With substantial inflammation due to his weight, stress levels, and typical diet, Cody wanted to find a natural solution that could help. Cody finally found turmeric by reviewing every bit of research he could, giving him the basis for the first anti-inflammatory remedy requiring no prescription. While it wasn’t a medicine, this supplement had proven anti-inflammatory benefits, setting the standard for what Science Natural Supplements would become. Even though his father’s doctors failed to find these solutions pharmaceutically, the launch of Science Natural Supplements proved highly beneficial for his father and others like him. However, turmeric was just the start. Through the years, Science Natural Supplements has launched several supplements, but three products seem to be the best-selling options for the company.

                JOINT BASE MYER-HENDERSON HALL, VA – Tradition often imposes unrealistic views on what people can and can’t do. Science, for instance. Traditionally viewed as a career field for men, young girls are often discouraged from pursuing their interests in science.
In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly proclaimed Feb. 11 as International Day of Women and Girls in Science to highlight the vital role women play in science. 
The latest research by the United States Census Bureau shows growth in women working in science and other STEM related fields, but that growth has been slow, from eight percent in 1970 to 27 percent in 2019.
For growth to continue, Jenny Tolbert, environmental specialist for the Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall Directorate of Public Works Environmental Management Division, said girls need to be given the space to explore the different types of science to see what they like. 
“I think it's important for girls to have the opportunity to be able to try out different things,” Tolbert said. “I remember when I was a kid, I had a hard time with biology, but I loved physics. We need to provide girls the opportunities to see just how much fun and rewarding the sciences can be.”
Giving girls a voice and making sure they feel heard in the classroom can go a long way toward helping keep their interest, Tolbert said. When she was a young girl, Tolbert recalled she had some great teachers who made learning about science fun. 
Projects that required creative problem solving, such as building a structure out of paper and tape that could withstand the weight of 10 books, or finding the best way to build a cage around an egg using toothpicks so the egg wouldn’t break when it was dropped from the top of a ladder, were her favorite types of projects. She said these types of projects were like puzzles she was eager to solve.
Pursuing her passion
Growing up in the Chesapeake Bay area, Tolbert developed a passion for science and the environment early in life.
“Even when I was a kid, I was trying to recycle as much as I could, and I'm all about not wasting,” Tolbert said. “Going into environmental science, my goal was to help protect the environment...",0

(KYMA, KECY) - The San Diego State University (SDSU) Brawley campus will be adding new laboratories. Local leaders and the SDSU community came together for a historical event as the campus will be expanding. The project has a price tag of $80 million that came from state funding approved by California Governor Gavin Newsom. This is to expand sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics opportunities for local students. Former California State Senator Ben Hueso said he remembers when the Brawley campus was planning to close but on Friday, history is being made. “And I have to say that I am very proud of what we did together in turning things around, nothing's ever done by one person and in the case of turning California towards a new path fighting to bring resources to imperial county it was a community-wide effort,"" stated Hueso. The laboratories will have a stem innovation hub for students and faculty. The project is set to be completed next year.

More than 70M Americans have water contaminated with ‘forever chemicals’: study,2024-02-09T17:28:34+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/09/business/forever-chemicals-in-70m-american-water-systems-study/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 More than 70 million Americans are drinking tap water contaminated with “forever chemicals” linked to cancer, as well as reproductive and immune system damage, according to a federal study. These “forever chemicals” — formally known as per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) — are microscopic, man-made compounds that can’t be broken down by the body. The federal Environmental Protection Agency reported this month that after testing just one-third of public water supplies in the US, an alarming number of residents are being exposed to “forever chemicals.” Of the 3,700 water systems tested by the EPA, the most contaminated were found in densely populated regions like New York, New Jersey, and parts of California and Texas. The EPA’s results were extrapolated and applied to population figures in an analysis by the activist organization Environment Working Group (EWG), the Daily Mail earlier reported. “The full scale of PFAS contamination is likely much more widespread,” an EWG spokesperson said, noting that the EPA’s report only provides a snapshot of the situation in the US. Big Apple residents, however, seem to have clean drinking water. The EPA’s interactive map of PFAS contamination across US water systems showed that the island of Manhattan had zero reports of “forever chemicals.” New York City’s Environmental Protection organization even touts on its website that the Big Apple’s “drinking water is world-renowned for its quality.” But it’s not just the water systems where PFAS pose a threat to human health. The chemicals are also found in food packaging, cookware, clothes, and cleaning supplies as they’re known to serve as a protective heat-, oil- and stain-resistant barrier in many household items, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The EPA report comes on the heals of another concerning study published last month in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that found there are an average of 240,000 plastic particles in a 1-liter water bottle — 100 times more than researchers previously thought. The scientists tested for levels of “nanoplastics,” which are under 1 micrometer in length — or 1/70 the width of a human hair — versus more commonly analyzed microplastics, which are between 1 and 5,000 micrometers in length. Nanoplastics, however, pose potentially a greater health risk because they’re small enough to penetrate cells and enter the bloodstream, plus have the ability to impact organs, experts said. They can also pass through the placenta in a pregnant woman and affect unborn babies. The new tech was used to examine 25 different brands of 1-liter water bottles. Though the researchers refused to specify which brands they tested, they found between 110,000 and 370,000 of these itty bitty plastic fragments in each of the liters — 90% of them nanoplastics. According to the Mayo Clinic, adult men should drink about 3.7 liters of wate...",0

"3 ski, snowboard organizations withdraw from BC Winter Games due to lack of snow",2024-02-09T17:05:47+00:00,https://globalnews.ca/news/10284332/organizations-withdraw-bc-winter-games-lack-snow/,"Instructions: Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first. 
				If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.			 Three provincial sports organizations have withdrawn from the Lhtako Quesnel 2024 BC Winter Games. BC Alpine Ski, Freestyle BC and BC Snowboard made their decisions after consultation with coaches and the BC Games Society, due to the lack of snowpack and snowfall at Troll Ski Resort. This will impact roughly 240 athletes. “In recognition of the value that the BC Games provide as an important milestone for athletes, sports organizations impacted by withdrawal are exploring alternate single-sport training or competition opportunities for participants and will continue to collaborate with the BC Games Society to incorporate elements of the games experience,” organizers said in a press release. Biathlon and cross-country events are still expected to take place. Both are exploring “modified scenarios” for competitions either on snow or dryland. Organizers said it takes more than 18 months for host societies to plan the BC Winter Games, and agreements with local ski resorts are signed early in the process to reserve space, ensure that technical requirements are met, and secure the appropriate volunteer workforce to support events. The games are set to take place Feb. 22 to 25 and will proceed with representation from 13 sports, more than 1,200 participants from around the province, and 1,350 host society volunteers in a celebration of community and sport. Provincial Sport Organizations impacted by cancellations are investigating the potential of future events, or training opportunities, for the age-group participants affected, as well. B.C.’s average snowpack is almost 40 per cent lower than normal, according to the province. The province’s latest snow bulletin says levels remain “very low” at 61 per cent of normal, compared to 79 per cent of normal this time last year. The bulletin shows the snowpack is especially sparse across the South Coast, ranging from 30 per cent of normal on Vancouver Island to 47 per cent in the Lower Fraser region. The Stikine region in northwestern B.C. has the highest snowpack in the province at 90 per cent of the average. The email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.

US to invest more than $5bn into semiconductor R&D space,2024-02-09T17:00:40+00:00,https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/us-semiconductor-research-funding-investment,"
by Colin Ryan
 
9 Feb 2024  Image: © nespix/Stock.adobe.com The investment is being implemented under the Chips and Science Act, as the country continues its efforts to boost its capabilities in the sector. The US expects to invest more than $5bn in its semiconductor R&D industry, according to an announcement released today (9 February). The investment, which is being implemented under the Chips and Science Act, will primarily benefit the National Semiconductor Technology Center (NSTC), a public-private R&D consortium established to combine and support public and private sectors to “accelerate the pace of new innovations, lower barriers to participation in semiconductor R&D and directly address fundamental needs for a skilled, diverse semiconductor workforce”. According to a statement from the White House, this investment intends to “advance US leadership in semiconductor R&D, cut down on the time and cost of commercialising new technologies, bolster US national security, and connect and support workers in securing good semiconductor jobs”. As well as the $5bn investment intended to boost the operational capabilities of the NSTC, the Biden administration also announced plans to invest “hundreds of millions of dollars” into the NSTC’s workforce efforts, including the creation of a Workforce Center of Excellence with a presence in multiple regions. The NSTC will leverage workforce investments to achieve a number of objectives in the areas of education and training, such as piloting initiatives to engage underserved communities. US investment into the semiconductor space has had a strong start this year, following the announcement of an investment totalling $162m into Arizona-headquartered company Microchip Technology last month, as the country continues its efforts to boost its semiconductor industry. This investment was followed by data indicating that global semiconductor sales appear to be on the rise again, coinciding with the global rush to develop AI technology, which relies heavily on advanced semiconductors. But while the industry is predicted to see further growth this year, challenges remain, such as a global skills shortage. All the while geopolitical issues persist between the US and its semiconductor rival, China. Trade tensions escalated greatly between the two countries last year, particularly concerning chip technologies, as the US and its allies believe that China is importing advanced chip technologies from the West crucial to the development of AI, which could be deployed for various military uses. These tensions resulted in US-imposed export restrictions on chips and related technologies to China.

The development follows Nirma's deal to acquire 75% stake in Glenmark Life Sciences for Rs 5,651.5 crore agreed in September last year. The open offer is being made to the public shareholders to acquire up to 2.13 crore equity shares representing 17.33% of the voting share capital at an offer price of Rs 631.20 per share aggregating to a total consideration of up to Rs 1,343.05 crore, said the letter of offer by Nirma shared on BSE by Glenmark Life Sciences.

     The first little blue penguin has hatched on the West Coast at Birch Aquarium in San Diego on New Year’s Day. It will join the ""diverse"" penguin colony at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. A bounty of 10 African penguin chicks has hatched in just over a year at a San Francisco science museum as part of an effort to conserve the endangered bird. The penguins began hatching in November 2022, ending a four year period without any new chicks, and continued through January of this year, the California Academy of Sciences announced Wednesday. African penguins have dwindled to 9,000 breeding pairs in the wild, the academy said in a statement. MEMPHIS ZOO NAMES NEWLY HATCHED ENDANGERED PENGUIN CHICK AFTER 'LORD OF THE RINGS' CHARACTER Threats such as overfishing, habitat degradation and oil spills have reduced colonies of the charismatic black-and-white birds, said Brenda Melton, director of animal care and well-being at the museum's Steinhart Aquarium. ""Every chick we welcome strengthens the genetics and overall population of the species in human care,"" she said. Chicks spend their first three weeks with their penguin parents in a nest box. They then attend ""fish school,"" where they learn to swim on their own and eat fish provided by biologists. Once ready, they are introduced to the colony. Two African penguin chicks are seen in their enclosure at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco on Feb. 8, 2024. Lazola, foreground, and his brother, Ignatz, background, were both born in February 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) The 21 penguins at the museum in Golden Gate Park have distinct personalities and are identifiable by their arm bands, according to the academy's website. Opal is the oldest and, at age 36, has perfected the ability to catch fish in mid-air. Her partner, Pete, is a messy eater and a flirt. Partners Stanlee and Bernie, who both like to bray, produced four of the 10 chicks, including Fyn, named for a type of vegetation found on the southern tip of Africa. Fyn is the youngest on exhibit and older sister to Nelson and Alice, both hatched in November. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fyn often runs up to biologists when they enter the habitat and shakes her head at them — typical courtship behavior that chicks and juveniles commonly display toward people who have cared for them since hatching. The youngest chick hatched Jan. 12, and its sex has not yet been determined. African penguins can live to be 27 years old in the wild, and longer in captivity.

Climate scientist Michael Mann awarded $1m in defamation lawsuit,2024-02-09T13:31:44+00:00,https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/michael-mann-climate-defamation-lawsuit-b2493557.html,"Notifications can be managed in browser preferences. Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in ‘It’s a good day for us, it’s a good day for science’ he said  Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile A jury on Thursday awarded $1 million to climate scientist Michael Mann who sued a pair of conservative writers 12 years ago after they compared his depictions of global warming to a convicted child molester. Mann, a professor of climate science at the University of Pennsylvania, rose to fame for a graph first published in 1998 in the journal Nature that was dubbed the “hockey stick” for its dramatic illustration of a warming planet. The work brought Mann wide exposure but also many skeptics, including the two writers Mann took to court for comments that he said affected his career and reputation in the U.S. and internationally. “It feels great,” Mann said Thursday after the six-person jury delivered its verdict. “It’s a good day for us, it’s a good day for science.” In 2012, a libertarian think tank named the Competitive Enterprise Institute published a blog post by Rand Simberg, then a fellow at the organization, that compared investigations into Mann’s work to the case of Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach at Penn State University who was convicted of sexually assaulting multiple children. At the time, Mann also worked at Penn State. Mann’s research was investigated after his and other scientists’ emails were leaked in 2009 in an incident that brought further scrutiny of the “hockey stick” graph, with skeptics claiming Mann manipulated data. Investigations by Penn State and others found no misuse of data by Mann, but his work continued to draw attacks, particularly from conservatives. “Mann could be said to be the Jerry Sandusky of climate science, except for instead of molesting children, he has molested and tortured data,” Simberg wrote. Another writer, Mark Steyn, later referenced Simberg’s article in his own piece in National Review, calling Mann’s research “fraudulent.” The jury in Superior Court of the District of Columbia found that Simberg and Steyn made false statements, awarding Mann $1 in compensatory damages from each writer. It awarded punitive damages of $1,000 from Simberg and $1 million from Steyn, after finding that the pair made their statements with “maliciousness, spite, ill will, vengeance or deliberate intent to harm”. During the trial, Steyn represented himself, but said through his manager Melissa Howes that he would be appealing the $1m award in punitive damages, saying it would have to face “due process scrutiny.” Mann argued that he had lost grant funding as a result of the blog posts — an assertion for which both defendants said Mann did not provide sufficient evidence. The writers countered during the trial that Mann instead became one of the world’s most well-known climate scien...",0

"After Rough Alpine F1 Stint, Trackhouse Racing’s MotoGP Operation Recruits ex Suzuki Team Manager Davide Brivio",2024-02-09T12:55:52+00:00,https://www.essentiallysports.com/nascar-news-after-rough-alpine-formula-one-stint-trackhouse-racing-motogp-operation-recruits-ex-suzuki-team-manager-davide-brivio/,"Latest NBA NFL NASCAR Golf Tennis ES Fancast Latest NBA NFL NASCAR Golf Tennis ES Fancast Home NASCAR Follow Us Back in 2021, when Davide Brivio announced his departure from the MotoGP paddock to venture into the world of Formula 1 as Alpine F1’s Racing Director, fans of the famed two-wheeler series were more than just shocked. After all, Brivio had just come off of his latest MotoGP World Championships with Joan Mir and Suzuki, a record-breaking feat that finally put an end to the team’s 20-year-long drought of winning the title. And while expectations were set in a similar realm for his Formula 1 stint, after three years and no major progress toward the frontrunners, it’s safe to Brivio returning to his home ground was an inevitable prospect. So when Justin Marks and Trackhouse Racing’s MotoGP team was finally taking shape, all it took was Brivio to show slight interest. And just like that, Trackhouse Racing is now going to be led by one of motorsport’s most successful team principals! ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad While it’s no secret that Davide Brivio is perhaps the perfect fit for a new project like Trackhouse Racing, his move to Formula 1 was also for similar reasons. Renault was going through a major makeover and transitioning to Alpine, meaning the team was surrounded by new personnel. And with a driver of Fernando Alonso’s calibre making his way into the crew, it seemed like the perfect opportunity for Brivio to be a part of a new beginning in Formula 1. Unfortunately, the team failed to build momentum through the last few seasons whilst their competitors seemed to keep getting further ahead. So naturally, after three years of leading Alpine, it was time for Brivio to take on a new challenge. While you might be saying Moto GP itself isn’t a new challenge for the established TP, the fact that Trackhouse Racing is bringing forward an entirely new team creates an enticing proposition. In a statement released by MotoGP, Brivio stated, “It all happened very quickly in the last days with Justin asking me to help Trackhouse in the MotoGP challenge. It’s so exciting to be a part of this new project since the beginning and I’m really looking forward to get to know Trackhouse more and see what we can bring to MotoGP from the successful vision and experience that this company has in other sports and environments.” HUGE news: Davide Brivio will return to MotoGP in 2024 as team principal of Trackhouse Racing! pic.twitter.com/7W5zu6aa5a — Simon Patterson (@denkmit) February 8, 2024  Brivio feels that it could be a great combination and that there is only one test that remains before the team gets to racing, so the pressure is on. He added, “We will try to support as much as we can our two talented riders Miguel and Raul and have fun. In the last few days everything has happened very quickly and before I could not say where I was going but hey, it’s great news and we will start working quickly!” WATCH THIS STORY: The unmatched legacy o...",0

			Trending:		 Tanya Moore doesn’t believe schools are educating the youth enough about Black history so she’s doing her best to fill that role with Keyz STEAM Society. The Keyz STEAM Society Executive Director was on hand at downtown Vallejo’s Immersive Learning Center on Saturday as part of a month-long, weekend event to educate people on Black History in the Americas. All of the Americas. ‘I want people to know more about South America, Central America and North America,” Moore said. “All people of African descent. There is plight in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, the Caribbean and of course, here in the United States. All of this is history and we need to bring all of it to light.” Moore said she’s looking forward to discussing the entire history of America. “It’s not just Black or White I want to discuss,” Moore said. “We have all been here at the same time living together and we need to discuss that. It’s all history as we’ve all been interacting with each other.” Moore said she wants to educate people not only on the slave ships that came to America, but the ships that went in reverse to the Caribbean. The Keyz STEAM Society will be hosting the event from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday as well as next weekend. Although the Immersive Learning Center was a little quiet on Saturday due to the rainy weather, Moore is hoping people show up Sunday as well as Feb. 24 and 25. After all, each day has a plethora of activities, including workshops, screenings of documentaries, a family genealogy search, virtual reality events, a science icon media gallery as well as a number of food dishes that represent numerous areas. “We’ll have a Vegan gumbo, a fish gumbo as well as some treats from Central America,” Moore said. “We’ll also have tamales and learn the history of them.” Moore said the average age of people attending the events has been around the ages of 8-12, but she added that the event has something for everyone. “We have a youth time, a family time and now we’re looking to add more events for adults,” Moore said. “We have screenings on each day, and family history searches, but we also know that kids are interested in gadgets and want to working with things, so we have that available, too.” For more information on the event, visit artvallejo.org/events/black-history-month-keys-steam-society-2024-02-18/.

Go with your gut: the science and psychology behind our sense of intuition,2024-02-17T23:00:26+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/feb/18/go-with-your-gut-the-science-and-psychology-behind-our-sense-of-intuition,"From deciding where to have lunch to choosing to walk away from a danger you haven’t even identified yet, intuition plays a part in all our lives On a rainy night in London, a young woman walks towards the entrance of a sidestreet, smiling to herself as she recalls the evening spent with the friend she just farewelled at the train station. She’s about to walk down the poorly-lit shortcut that will take her back to her accommodation, when she stops. Something in her body tells her not to go down that street. She pauses, then turns back towards the busy, well lit but longer route home. “Where are you going?” She hadn’t heard the footsteps of the man who had been walking behind her. He seems thrown by her change of direction. Instincts screaming, she doesn’t answer and hurries away along the main road. Everyone has a story like this – the road they didn’t walk down, the cafe they didn’t go into, the time their body reacted to save them a split second before something bad happened. There are many terms for it; a sixth sense, a gut feeling, something in the air. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads According to University of New South Wales neuroscientist and psychologist Joel Pearson, this is what’s happening in the brain in that moment: “[It’s] processing all the things in the environment; the time of day, how well it’s lit, how well it’s not lit, the pace the person’s walking, for example, the shadows, the tone and a hundred other things. “It’s going to be making a prediction based on prior learning, situations you’ve been in, also movies you’ve watched and all the things that you’ve been through in your life.” Call it intuition – a nebulous concept that Pearson has been studying for 25 years. As the author of a new book called The Intuition Toolkit, he’s settled on a solid definition for that thing a lot of people can’t quite put their finger on: “It’s the learned, positive use of unconscious information for better decisions or actions.” In his Future Minds Lab at UNSW, Pearson is engaged in the science of consciousness; in particular how information from our unconscious affects our decision-making, behaviour and feelings, and what effect emotion has on that process. “It’s this fascinating topic,” he says, “but the science was just really bad at it.” It’s the science of “psychophysics”; a subfield of psychology that Pearson describes as developing blood tests or microscopes for the mind. “But it’s not cells or neurons or chemicals when looking under the microscope, it’s behaviour and experiences and representations, whether it be depression or anxiety or mental imagery or intuition.” The goal of Pearson’s work is to understand not only what intuition is, but how it happens, how we use it, and how we can use it better. The first challenge was to come up with an accurate and useful definition for intuition. That’s important because a lot of things get lumped under intuition – paranoia, emotional thinking, cognitive bias, the human ten...",0

 Pakistan  APP February 18, 2024  The speakers Saturday called for integrating anticipatory disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) approaches with climate science to make sure that more lives are protected from climatic disasters. Speaking at a panel discussion organized at the World Social Forum in Kathmandu on Saturday by Pakistan’s leading think tank ‘Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and Oxfam in Pakistan, the speakers said that the incidence of climatic hazards and disasters are increasing which plunged communities into vulnerability to disasters and are causing losses and damages, said a press release. Speaking on the occasion, globally acclaimed climate justice expert Harjeet Singh said that the temperatures are the determining factor of climate change which calls for analyzing science for better adaptation and preparing communities against climatic hazards and disasters. He called upon the humanitarian sector to keep in mind the future warming levels and slow on-set disasters while designing humanitarian programmes. He said the communities know much about the impacts of climate change such as glacier melting, changing cropping patterns, and water availability but they do not know why this is happening. He said that science gives the ‘why’ answer. He said while climate change is creating new poor with more marginalities, there is a need to opt for nature-based solutions for adaptation. He called for integrating humanitarian approaches with science. The Deputy Executive Director of SDPI Dr. Shafqat Munir said that climatic hazards are now putting cities and towns at risk urging the need for risk-sensitive urban planning through applying both Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) strategies. He said preparedness and anticipatory DRR approaches can better equip vulnerable communities at local levels to cope with ensuing disasters/climatic hazards. The localization of DRR-CCA strategies and implementation plans can help to save and protect more lives. He called for taking urgent collective action to achieve the Paris Agreement’s objective on the Global Goal on Adaptation and Sendai Framework for DRR. Oxfam’s regional humanitarian coordinator Mr. Jermaine, from the Philippines, said that effective climate action requires a balanced approach, considering both adaptation and mitigation efforts. Similarly, there is a need to ensure equity, right, and justice in line with the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) framework that prioritize fairness and equitable adaptation strategies, he added. Quoting from Cyclone Hayan 2013, he said due to inappropriate early warning messaging, the communities could not prepare against the Tsunami. He said that there is a need to train communities on DRR and early warning messaging should be clear.

                BALTIMORE (2/16/2024) – Science, technology, engineering and mathematics will be the foundations for solving the problems of today and tomorrow, the National Guard’s top officer told an audience of students, cadets, corporate executives and military leaders here Friday.

Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson, the 29th Chief of the National Guard Bureau, added that the world is full of complicated problems, and the military needs smart, capable people who are driven to solve them.  

“And, if you want to be part of solving the hardest problems—because, let’s face it, those are the only ones left—I wholeheartedly invite you to be part of our team,” Hokanson said.

The National Guard was the featured military organization of the 2024 Black Engineer of the Year Award STEM Stars and Stripes Dinner. The annual BEYA conference, which celebrates the achievements of African American engineers, draws thousands of professionals, students, and attendees interested in STEM during the three-day event.

“I am extremely proud to have the BEYA Conference back in Baltimore, so we can showcase all of the talent in and out of uniform across the great state of Maryland,” said Army Maj. Gen. Janeen Birckhead, the adjutant general of Maryland. “This conference is also very important for young people of all backgrounds to see what STEM job opportunities are out there in the military or as a civilian in these amazing careers.”

Birckhead spoke of the late Cunningham C. Bryant, the first African American federally recognized as a general officer in the National Guard in 1971. He led the D.C. Army National Guard from 1974 to 1981 as its first Black commander and retired as a major general. 

Bryant was a trailblazer who paved the way for future Black leaders to serve in military leadership positions, Birckhead said.

                U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. – In a conference room nestled among the classrooms and academic laboratories of Gregory Hall, cadets bring their individual readings to the table. The unique class Dr. Kimberly Gardner is teaching is more of a discussion than a lecture. The cadets choose their topics and what they read.

Today, the discussion is about gemstones. This is a chemistry course, but the cadet’s broad core of knowledge leads over and through political science, history, economics, earth sciences, eventually settling upon blood diamonds.

The blood diamond discussion flows along, touching upon philosophy and ethics, posing the question: would you use what you know of blood diamonds in your decision to purchase one?

“I love to see them able to tie what they’ve learned in other classes to what we’re talking about in our class and to their own lives,” said Gardner, a U.S. Air Force Academy chemistry associate professor. “In many universities, the core is so limited you’d never see that.”

The small classroom setting and conversations with cadets are just what Gardner loves most about teaching at the Academy.

“Cadets are amazing – the best part of my day is spent with cadets,” she said. “[I value] their respect for and interest in learning, the ability to interact with them one-on-one and really get to know them, learn their stories.”

In addition to her years of teaching, Gardner and her family have taken in cadets as a sponsor family, acting as mentors and a home-away-from-home. She maintains those relationships over the years and recently hosted graduates she sponsored from the 2005 and 2006 classes and their families to her home for the holidays.

“This weekend, our grad from the class of ’99 will be here; her son is over at the [U.S. Air Force Academy Preparatory School]. We’ll be a second-generation sponsor family,” she laughed.

Col. Michael A. Hyland, chemistry department head, first worked with Gardner in 2006 when he was a junior officer in his first assignment at the Academy. Now he works as her department head nearly 20 years later.

“She has been here since 1996 and she is an absolute wealth of knowledge, both academically and institutionally,” Hyland said. “She’s not just a problem solver, she’s a fixer. Last year, I gave her a [coffee] mug that said ‘chaos solving agent,'” he joked.

“I’ve been at the Academy for 27 years,” said Gardner. “Very few people are lucky enough to get their dream jobs right out of college. I did.”             This work, 27-year chemistry professor puts cadets first, by Katherine Spessa, identified by DVIDS, must comply with the restrictions shown on https://www.dvidshub.net/about/copyright.

			Trending:		 I know very little about artificial intelligence. From media headlines, AI can sound like the greatest threat to human society or the solution to many problems. I thought it worth digging into a bit to see how it might work in areas I do know something about. If you are like me, you probably know AI has something to do with algorithms and can forecast outcomes, but perhaps not much more. I dug into a little AI basics to better understand how it is being applied to earthquake detection, early warning, prediction, and tsunami forecasting. Computers and algorithms have been a part of seismology for over half a century. In my early years in graduate school in the late 60s, I lugged boxes of punch cards over to the computer center, picking them up several hours later often only to discover a fatal error that prevented the completion of my run. Mine was the only intelligence involved and often I found it lacking. The critical advance in AI is the ability of the program to learn and adapt without human intervention. To do so requires vast quantities of information about the task at hand – the machine learning part of the process. Traditional programming like I was doing with my stacks of punch cards is like cooking. You carefully define what goes into the recipe, giving a detailed set of instructions on what the computer is supposed to do with the data you have supplied. Machine learning (ML) is the “training” part of the AI process, loading an enormous amount of data into the system and identifying any number of patterns. Spam phone call recognition is an example that anyone with a smartphone uses on a daily basis. The data set is phone numbers and past behavior. Some numbers can be identified as belonging to marketing companies. Others are identified from message content and users’ behavior. Every time you or anyone else marks a message as spam, it goes into the larger database and the next time it is used, it is flagged as potential spam. ML allows the system to learn new things as it acquires more data. The AI step is the algorithms telling the computers what to do with all the data that has been acquired. With spam phone calls or email, it is a relatively straightforward process of announci...",0
Warfare Center welcomes high school students to science symposium,2024-02-17T19:32:09+00:00,https://njtoday.news/2024/02/17/warfare-center-welcomes-high-school-students-to-science-symposium/,"NJTODAY.NET 
			Your neighborhood in print since 1822		 By Adam Hochron  The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst hosted an annual science symposium on Feb. 9 at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst featuring local students whose ingenuity could someday support the warfighter. The New Jersey Southern Junior Science and Humanities Symposium promotes research and experimentation in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields for high school students and recognizes outstanding achievement.  The students compete for scholarships and other awards, with the top five finalists from the Lakehurst event advancing to the Department of Defense National Junior Science and Humanities Symposium in New Mexico later this year. In his opening remarks, Jack Martenak, Lakehurst’s technical director and chief engineer, said the creativity and diverse perspectives the students brought to their research are the same qualities that help Lakehurst’s employees continue their mission of supporting the warfighters who keep the country safe. “Aside from considering future career pursuits, take hold of the present,” Martenak said. “Take full advantage of this competition and authentic learning experience to strengthen your skills and confidence. You never know what opportunities and further learning can come from a new collaborative partnership.” The judges for the symposium included personnel from NAWCAD Lakehurst; Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division; the U.S. Army Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR) Center; the New Jersey Sea Grant Consortium; and Ocean County College. Research projects included oral presentations on a potential new design for safer helmets to reduce traumatic brain injuries, and how a technology change can make ships used to keep the supply chain moving more environmentally friendly.  There were also poster presentations where students shared research on topics that directly affect lives in and around Lakehurst. One student looked at the hydrological impacts of developed lagoonal systems in Barnegat Bay, while another discussed his work developing an app to help local crabbers determine if they can keep their catch. NAWCAD Lakehurst Education Outreach Site Lead Gaetan Mangano, who has been supporting the regional NJ symposium for over ten years, said it was another very impressive showing by all the students involved. “Year in and year out the students presenting at this symposium never cease to amaze us with their intelligence and poise to passionately present their research and innovation,” Mangano said. “Our workforce generously supports this symposium in a variety of ways, including providing research paper reviewers, finalist presentation judges, symposium navigational mentors, and event coordination, including recognition plaques.” Mangano said the success of the event at the local and national level after 62 years is a “testamen...",0

 The role of the State, in its relationship to NGOs, has turned from being a partner to being a regulator with the arrival of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) that has undergone more and more stringent revisions. The role is not only a regulator but to actually seeing NGOs as potential subverter or a threat to the role of the State so that NGOs are under increasing scrutiny, and oftentimes are being shut down with very arbitrary hardheaded action by the government, Vikram Patel, Paul Farmer Professor and Chair, Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School, said. Delivering the 40th year oration of Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) (India) on “The power of civil society to transform India” on Saturday, he gave a clarion call to the government to treat NGOs as a trusted and essential partner for the country. NGOs, he said, have had a very long and impactful history in the country, evolving from individual acts of kindness to organised efforts that have transformed communities, the country and science.  “And yet today, there is an undeniable sense that the NGO sector is under siege, that it is somehow guilty of doing something wrong; maybe a financial impropriety. Perhaps worryingly that it is actually guilty of undermining the country’s development agenda or even worse that it is a Trojan horse for foreign powers, which fear India’s rise,” he said. Citing an Intelligence Bureau report in 2014, he said the report accused foreign-funded NGOs of serving as tools for foreign policy interests of western governments. Unsubstantiated theories, he said, have led to the degradation of India’s NGO sector by squeezing tight the flow of funds to these organisations. He recalled how the Public Health Foundation of India was stuck in 2017 when its FCRA license was taken away, with a similar stripping of the Centre for Policy Research, one of the most important policy research institutions the country has ever had. “Even if it was true that some NGOs were guilty of these allegations, it is a grotesque misrepresentation of the NGO sector that has been working in this country for more than a century, and has committed itself to so many social causes that have transformed our society,” Dr. Patel said. The latest iteration of the FCRA has thrown a spanner in the works of one of the most important aspects of civil society which is to work in partnership with other organisations, he observed. “Here was a country t...",0

AI-powered mobile clinic helping transform healthcare in Jammu and Kashmir,2024-02-17T15:57:52+00:00,https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/ai-powered-mobile-clinic-helping-transform-healthcare-in-jammu-and-kashmir-417945-2024-02-17?utm_source=rssfeed,"Feedback In a groundbreaking development, Aarogya-Doctor on Wheels, an innovative mobile telemedicine clinic driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI), has revolutionized healthcare access for remote communities in the Udhampur-Kathua-Doda Lok Sabha constituency of Jammu and Kashmir. Union Minister for Science and Technology, Jitendra Singh, revealed on Saturday that this pioneering initiative has already provided crucial medical assistance to nearly 13,000 patients. Inspired by the Digital Health Mission and Ayushman Bharat, this trailblazing super-speciality mobile hospital offers doorstep consultations with medical professionals, effectively bridging the gap between urban and rural healthcare services, Singh stated. Highlighting the unique aspects of the service, Singh noted that Aarogya-Doctor on Wheels is the first healthcare facility of its kind to be delivered entirely through digital means, spearheaded by two startup groups from North and South India, operating independently of government support. Operating on cutting-edge technology, the clinic employs an advanced methodology where patients can describe their symptoms or concerns in their native language, which the AI Doctor comprehends and responds to in the same language, Singh explained. Patients visiting the clinic undergo comprehensive screening and investigations before consulting with super-specialist doctors from leading hospitals in metropolitan cities like Hyderabad and Bengaluru. This streamlined process, from examination to prescription, typically takes around 45 minutes, a remarkable improvement compared to traditional hospital visits that could span several days, Singh emphasized. Importantly, all services are provided free of cost, funded through voluntary contributions. Singh highlighted the significant impact of the initiative on women, noting that a majority of beneficiaries are female. Out of over 11,000 beneficiaries in areas including Doda, Hiranagar, and Kathua-Billawar, more than 6,000 were women. The mobile clinic, currently in its fourth phase, continues to extend its reach to remote areas such as Dudu Basantgarh in the upper reaches of Ramnagar block. Out of 1,452 beneficiaries across 56 villages and 22 Panchayats, over 800 women have availed consultations. The Minister elaborated on the previous phases of the initiative, which covered villages in the Gandoh area of Doda district, Zero Line villages along the International Border, and the upper regions of Bilawar. Singh underscored how the free telemedicine service addresses key healthcare challenges of accessibility, availability, and affordability, particularly in remote regions. To further enhance patient convenience, prescribed medicines are provided free of charge, alongside distribution of medicine kits containing essential drugs to families across the constituency, Singh concluded.

Can Aging Be Reversible?,2024-02-17T14:01:00+00:00,https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/can-aging-be-reversible-health-1236175335/,"Modern science has caught up with aging, according to David Andrew Sinclair, biologist and professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School. 
	Would you want to know your body’s real age? 
	That was the question David Andrew Sinclair — known for his research on aging and epigenetics — posed on X, formerly known as Twitter. A prominent biologist and academic, and professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, his work centers on why we age and how to slow its effects. 
	“We had an overwhelming response,” says Melanie Goldey, chief executive officer of Tally Health, the biotechnology company Sinclair cofounded with entrepreneur Whitney Casey. Together they’ve built a model to give people insights into their biological health and aging meant to allow wellbeing optimization.

	“We didn’t even have enough kits, because we didn’t expect that,” Goldey continues. “So we sent out a bunch of tests and we got 8,000 back.”

	








 
	It was the early days of Tally Health when Sinclair’s message went into cyberspace. That was the birth of the company’s database, which has an age range of 18 to 100 years old, more than 30 percent non-white and a nearly equal split of males and females, according to Goldey. The company is still only about a year old, having been unveiled on Feb. 23, 2023.

 
	And it’s caught the eye of Hollywood. 
	“I will tell you, I had the pleasure of listening to David speak at a small casual, sort of lecture-ish thingy,” actor and director Jason Bateman said on his Smartless podcast, cohosted with fellow actors Sean Hayes and Will Arnett. 
	“At someone’s house?” asked Arnett. 
	“At someone’s house,” Bateman affirmed. 
	“Hollywood does it right, don’t they?” Arnett laughed. “They just bring people in. Like, ‘You know what? Bring somebody smart over here and let them talk to us.’” 
	Bateman introduced Sinclair as the guest for the episode. “He said some things that really straighten me out as far as my knowledge of general health and mortality,” Bateman said on the podcast. 
	Discussing his life work and where the science stands today, Sinclair described the innovation as being “at the level of the Wright Brothers” in 1902 — as in American aviation pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright. 
	“We’re figuring out how to glide, but we do know it’s possible to fly,” explained Sinclair, who’s Australian American. “My colleagues and I, we’re about 100 leaders in the world doing this, we call it aging research or longevity research. It’s now a fact that modern science has caught up with aging. For a while we ignored it. We thought it was natural, acceptable. That’s B.S. It’s definitely not acceptable.

"(Opinion) Philip P. DiStefano: Scientific breakthroughs will be on display in Denver this week, but this research didn’t happen in a vacuum",2024-02-17T14:00:17+00:00,https://www.greeleytribune.com/2024/02/17/aaas-conference-denver-funding-research-science-university-of-colorado/,"e-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters e-Edition 
			Trending:		 This week, thousands of the world’s top scientists, educators, students and journalists are converging in Denver, shining a mile-high spotlight on some of the most incredible scientific advances impacting our world today. A “who’s who” of Nobel Laureates, leading academics and rising stars are gathering for the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest multidisciplinary scientific society, which formed in 1848. In an era of misinformation, distrust, and disregard for evidence, the work of scientists is more critical than ever. That’s why CU Boulder is a proud sponsor of this year’s AAAS meeting – and why our state and national leaders must sustain and deepen investments in the pursuit of knowledge that improves lives. Currently, the federal government provides $31.5 billion in academic research and development funding to America’s top research universities. CU Boulder attracted a record $684.2 million in research funding last fiscal year, which we used to conduct an array of groundbreaking research tied to health, climate, space, and quantum science, among many other fields. The CU system – which includes the Boulder, Denver, Colorado Springs, and Anschutz medical campuses – exceeded $1.5 billion in sponsored research during that same time period. Meanwhile, the four-campus CU system also ranked 30th on a list of universities worldwide that were granted utility patents in 2023, according to a new analysis released Thursday by the National Academy of Inventors. Day after day, University of Colorado researchers are working in laboratories, classrooms and in communities to find solutions to some of the world’s toughest problems, and they are translating their findings to products, processes and policies that help everyday people like you and me. The process is working – but the needs don’t stop. University researchers need steady or increased funding to continue addressing the world’s most critical issues. The AAAS meeting taking place in Denver this week is the latest example of translational science at work. More than a dozen CU Boulder faculty members are among those sharing their expertise as speakers and organizers this year.

Mexico is suing US gun-makers for arming its gangs − and they could could win billions in damages,2024-02-17T13:57:30+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/mexico-is-suing-us-gun-makers-for-arming-its-gangs-and-a-court-could-award-billions-in-damages/,"The government of Mexico is suing U.S. gun-makers for their role in facilitating cross-border gun trafficking that has supercharged violent crime in Mexico. The lawsuit seeks US$10 billion in damages and a court order to force the companies named in the lawsuit – including Smith & Wesson, Colt, Glock, Beretta and Ruger – to change the way they do business. In January, a federal appeals court in Boston decided that the industry’s immunity shield, which so far has protected gun-makers from civil liability, does not apply to Mexico’s lawsuit. As a legal scholar who has analyzed lawsuits against the gun industry for more than 25 years, I believe this decision to allow Mexico’s lawsuit to proceed could be a game changer. To understand why, let’s begin with some background about the federal law that protects the gun industry from civil lawsuits. In 2005, Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which prohibits lawsuits against firearm manufacturers and sellers for injuries arising from criminal misuse of a gun. Importantly, there are limits to this immunity shield. For example, it doesn’t protect a manufacturer or seller who “knowingly violated a State or Federal statute applicable to the sale or marketing” of a firearm. Mexico’s lawsuit alleges that U.S. gun-makers aided and abetted illegal weapons sales to gun traffickers in violation of federal law. Mexico claims that U.S. gun-makers engaged in “deliberate efforts to create and maintain an illegal market for their weapons in Mexico.” According to the lawsuit, the manufacturers intentionally design their weapons to be attractive to criminal organizations in Mexico by including features such as easy conversion to fully automatic fire, compatibility with high-capacity magazines and removable serial numbers. Mexico also points to industry marketing that promises buyers a tactical military experience for civilians. And Mexico alleges that manufacturers distribute their products to dealers whom they know serve as transit points for illegal gunrunning through illegal straw sales, unlicensed sales at gun shows and online, and off-book sales disguised as inventory theft. In short, Mexico claims that illegal gun trafficking isn’t just an unwanted byproduct of the industry’s design choices, marketing campaigns and distribution practices. Instead, according to the lawsuit, feeding demand for illegal weapons is central to the industry’s business model. In response, the gun-makers insist that Mexico’s attempt to hold them legally responsible for the criminal activity of others is precisely the type of lawsuit that the federal immunity shield was designed to block. They argue that merely selling a product that someone later uses in a crime does not amount to a violation of federal law that would deprive a manufacturer of immunity. Additionally, the gun-makers assert that, even if Mexico’s lawsuit were not barred by the immunity law, they have no legal duty to prevent criminal violence that oc...",0
Lagos park administrators award scholarships to 11 NANS leaders,2024-02-17T13:51:44+00:00,https://tribuneonlineng.com/lagos-park-administrators-award-scholarships-to-11-nans-leaders/,"The Lagos State Parks and Garages Administrators (LASPAGA) has given scholarships to students’ union presidents across the 11 tertiary institutions in Lagos. The schools include the Lagos State University (LASU) Ojo, Lagos State University of Science and Technology, Ikorodu; Lagos State University of Education, Ijanikin; Yaba College of Technology; Lagos State College of Health Technology, Yaba, amongst others. The Chairman, National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) Lagos State chapter, Alimi Lekan Idris, made this disclosure at a news conference recently. He noted that this action of LASPAGA is commendable as it will greatly ease the financial pressure they and other students as well as many other Nigerians are currently facing in the country due to economic downturn. The student body, while also praising LASPAGA for giving employment to some of their old members who have now graduated, said; “The provision of scholarship is not merely an act of generosity but a strategic investment in the future leaders of our society.” The students noted that the gesture would certainly aid their academic pursuits, adding that by this gesture, LASPAGA has proved to be an important entity that aims not only to nurture talent and intellect, but also foster a culture of excellence and leadership among Nigerian students. The students, therefore, lauded LASPAGA and particularly its Chairman, Oba Sulaimon Adesina Raji-Asade, for the gesture and also for ensuring peace and unity in Lagos motor parks since he became the chairman. They asked Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s led administration to continue to provide necessary support for the agency to thrive. They also urged the Federal Government to swiftly address issues affecting the country and remain committed to effect positive changes towards building a bright future for all Nigerians.

Alexander the Great’s father located in Greek tomb after remains ID’d using X-ray analysis: study,2024-02-17T09:36:24+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/17/world-news/alexander-the-greats-father-located-in-greek-tomb-using-x-ray-analysis/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Alexander the Great’s father’s remains have been identified in a Greek tomb using X-ray analysis, a new study says.  The new international — yet controversial study — states that archaeologists previously had the wrong tomb identified in Vergina, Greece, as containing Alexander the Great’s father, Philip II of Macedon, according to Live Science.  The site contains three 4th century B.C.E. tombs. The study was first published in the December issue of Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports. Along with Alexander the Great’s father, Philip II of Macedon, the researchers said the three tombs also contain Alexander’s half-brother, King Philip III Arrhidaeus, and his teenage son, Alexander IV.  In ancient times, Vergina was Macedonia’s original capital, known as Aegae. The archaeologists took x-rays of the skeletons in the tombs and compared them to detailed descriptions about the Macedonian royals, including height, weight, injuries and physical anomalies, according to Live Science.  Alexander’s father’s remains were identified by a knee injury that was “consistent with the historic evidence of the lameness of King Philip II,” the study said, according to Live Science. He was located in what is known as Tomb I rather than Tomb II, which he had previously thought to have been in, according to the study.   The Vergina site was first discovered in the 1970s, but debate has ensued about which royals were buried in each tomb.  Antonios Bartsiokas, the study’s lead author, told Live Science the research “was like a fascinating detective’s ancient story,” Bartsiokas is an anthropology and paleoanthropology professor at Democritus University of Thrace in Komotini, Greece. The researchers located King Philip III Arrhidaeus, Alexander the Great’s half-brother and successor, in Tomb II.  “His skeletal evidence and the pattern of his cremated bones have been shown to be consistent with the circumstances of the death of King Arrhidaeus and his wife,” Bartsiokas said, according to Live Science. “Tomb I was a very small and poor tomb and Tomb II was very big and rich. This ties with the historical evidence that Macedonia was in a state of bankruptcy when Alexander started his campaign and very rich when he died. This is consistent with Tomb I belonging to Philip II and Tomb II belonging to his son Arrhidaeus.” Philip II is believed to be interred with his wife and baby. Bartsiokas added, “This was the only newborn in the Macedonian dynasty to have died shortly after it was born. The age of the female skeleton at 18 years old was determined based on the epiphyseal lines of her humerus. [This number] coincides with the age of [his wife Queen] Cleopatra from the ancient sources.” He explained that the remains in Tomb II were also not found to have an eye injury as previously believed. Tomb I’s remains could not definitely determine if there was an eye injury due to its deterioration.   “Philip II is known...",0

Dietary fibre affects more than your colon,2024-02-17T08:11:12+00:00,https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/02/17/dietary-fibre-affects-more-than-your-colon/,"April 2, 2024 April 1, 2024 March 31, 2024 March 31, 2024 April 2, 2024 March 31, 2024 March 30, 2024 March 29, 2024 March 28, 2024 March 20, 2024 March 8, 2024 March 3, 2024 April 2, 2024 April 1, 2024 April 1, 2024 March 31, 2024 April 1, 2024 March 29, 2024 March 29, 2024 March 28, 2024 March 28, 2024 March 15, 2024 March 15, 2024 March 9, 2024 February 26, 2024 February 24, 2024 Mark Wulczynski looks at how the immune system, brain and overall health benefit too There’s no shortage of advice about what to eat, including hype about the latest superfoods that will help you live to 100, or about the newest restrictive diets that claim to help you lose weight and look beautiful. There is no universal “healthy diet” that will work for everyone, but most professionals would agree that a diet should be well balanced between the food groups, and it’s better to include more things like vegetables and fermented foods in your diet than restrict yourself unnecessarily. Eating foods that promote gut health improves your overall health too. The importance of fibre has been known for decades. The late great surgeon and fibre researcher Denis Burkitt once said, “If you pass small stools, you have to have large hospitals.” But dietary fibre does more than just help move your bowels. Fibre can be considered a prebiotic nutrient. Prebiotics aren’t actively digested and absorbed, rather they are selectively used to promote the growth of a beneficial species of microbes in the gut. These microbes then help digest foods for us so we can obtain more nutrients, promote gut barrier integrity and prevent the growth of harmful bacteria. Fibres can also have microbe-independent effects on our immune system when they interact directly with receptors expressed by our cells. These beneficial effects could even help teach the immune system to be more tolerant and reduce inflammation. Probably not. The so-called western diet is low in fibre and filled with ultra-processed foods. The recommendation for daily fibre is between 25 and 38 grams depending on factors like age, sex and activity level. Most people consume about half of the recommendation, and it can negatively affect overall health. Good sources of dietary fibre include whole grains, fruits and vegetables, beans and legumes, and nuts and seeds. There is a lot of emphasis on soluble fibres and less on insoluble fibres, but in reality, most foods will contain a mixture of both, and they each have their merits. High-fibre snacks are also gaining popularity. With an estimated global value of US$7 billion in 2022, the value of the prebiotic ingredient market is expected to triple by 2032. There’s plenty of evidence supporting the benefits of dietary fibre. Fibre isn’t just associated with colon health; it’s associated with overall health and brain health through the gut-brain axis. Diets low in fibre have been associated with gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. On the...",0

UC Santa Cruz professor wins national award for science research and policy,2024-02-25T23:14:52+00:00,https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2024/02/25/uc-santa-cruz-professor-wins-national-award-for-science-research-and-policy/,"e-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters e-Edition SANTA CRUZ — From catching the attention of J. Robert Oppenheimer to now earning a national award “for his many contributions to the scientific community, the science policy world and society writ large,” Joel R. Primack has been turning heads and leaving his mark on scientific research for nearly 60 years. Primack, distinguished professor of physics emeritus at UC Santa Cruz, was recently announced as the 2024 AAAS Philip Hauge Abelson Prize winner. The American Association for the Advancement of Science awards the Abelson Prize to those who demonstrate significant contributions to science through their research, policy work or public service in the United States. “As a young scientist, I was often advised that spending time on social and political issues would be career suicide, and that I should focus solely on research,” said Primack on receiving the reward. “But I take seriously the social responsibility of scientists, and I deeply appreciate being recognized both for my scientific contributions and for my efforts to broaden the opportunities for scientists and scientific societies to help solve the challenges facing our world.” Growing up in Montana, Primack became fascinated with science from an early age. His concern for its social implications grew during the arms race, where he was instructed to hide under his desk at school as drill practice for nuclear bomb threats. He would go on to study physics at Princeton University, where he graduated as valedictorian in 1966. Primack’s speech caught the attention of Oppenheimer — the theoretical physicist known as the father of the atomic bomb who was retiring as the head of Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study — who was impressed by his humanizing appeal of science. “I wouldn’t have made such a speech unless I had had a lot of preparation,” said Oppenheimer in the June 15, 1966, issue of the New York Times. Pursuing a Ph.D. in physics at Stanford University, Primack was further inspired to seek science policy by his graduate adviser Sidney Drell, a critical scientific consultant of the U.S. government on nuclear weapons. He then started a series of workshops to educate students on political and social issues with physics professor Frank von Hippel, another rising leader in science policy. These workshops led to the creation of a congressional fellowship program in 1973, which would eventually become the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellows Program. The fellowship supports an increasing number of scientists and engineers in getting first-hand experience in policymaking with the federal government. Primack has established that with good ideas and strong conviction, even young graduate students can have a big impact, said von Hippel. Primack continued his work in science policy as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University in 1970, when he founded the Union of Concerned Scientists and proposed the American...",0

US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said last week the US would need a second CHIPS Act if it wants to “lead the world” in the semiconductor supply chain and meet demand from artificial intelligence technologies. The CHIPS and Science Act, signed by US President Joe Biden in 2022, set aside $39 billion in direct grants, and an additional $75 billion in loans and loan guarantees worth $75 billion, to boost domestic semiconductor production. US semiconductor manufacturer Intel, which has unveiled plans for a $20 billion plant in Ohio and $20 billion expansion in Arizona, is discussing over $10 billion in grant and loan incentives. Intel said last week that it has signed Microsoft as a foundry customer and that it expects to beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in advanced chip manufacturing ahead of an internal deadline of 2025. Intel also seeks to mass-produce 1.8nm chips by late this year, ahead of Samsung and TSMC plans to manufacture 2nm chips in large quantities next year. It also set the same goal of producing ultrafine 1.4nm chips as Samsung and TSMC by 2027. “To be clear, we can‘t and do not want to make everything in America,” Raimondo said during a virtual appearance at an Intel event last week. “But we do need to diversify our semiconductor supply chains and have much more manufacturing in the US, particularly leading-edge chips, which will be essential for AI.” Japan, for its part, has been spending heavily to persuade companies such as TSMC, Samsung Electronics and Micron Technology to move their facilities to the country to secure a supply of chips used in cars and mobile phones. On Saturday, TSMC opened its first semiconductor plant in Japan on what used to be a cabbage field in Kumamoto, marking a head start in the global chip race. Despite early projections that it will take about five years to build, Japan managed to make it happen in just two years with efficient government support and construction work that went on for 24 hours, seven days a week.

Thursday, April 11, 2024
 Pakistan  News Desk February 26, 2024  More than 45.8 million children under five years of age would be vaccinated during the second anti-polio campaign across the country starting from February 26. Children would also be given vitamin A supplements to boost their immunity in the campaign which is kicking off from February 26 to March 3 in Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and in 33 districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from March 2 to March 6. “Polio is a terrible disease that has no cure and can leave children paralyzed for life. Unfortunately, it continues to be a threat to our children as some people refuse to vaccinate children based on misconceptions and false information about the vaccine,” the Federal Secretary for Health, Iftikhar Ali Shallwani, said after administering polio drops to children. Shallwani added that while the government remains strongly committed to ending polio in Pakistan and is making great progress, as decision-makers, parents and caregivers also have a huge responsibility to ensure their children well-being. In a special message directed to parents and caregivers, the health secretary emphasized, “Polio vaccinators will be delivering this vital vaccine to your doorsteps next week. I implore you to recognize the threat posed by the poliovirus to your children and ensure that you open your doors to facilitate their vaccination.”

The science behind why we see faces of famous people in food and on spoons and in pizza boxes,2024-02-25T16:00:00+00:00,https://metro.co.uk/2024/02/25/science-behind-see-faces-famous-people-food-20133256/,"NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Stu Goulden has seen it all on his morning runs: elephants, dolphins, mythical creatures and everything in between. The marketing worker and blogger is never shocked to see these wild animals eyeing him up in York, North Yorkshire. He’s even come to expect it. ‘Weirdly enough, it was on the day England played in a Euros qualifier, so it struck me even more,’ Stu, 43, tells Metro.co.uk of the time he saw a fluffy lion up in the clouds. ‘Finding faces in everyday objects and clouds is just a fun little game I like to play, and it turns runs into a bit of a treasure hunt.’ Stu isn’t alone. Seeing the faces of animals and people in inanimate objects like shocked plug sockets, sleepy-looking coffee machines and mean-eyed Jupiter storms has a name: pareidolia. Or, for seeing religious icons like Jesus in your toast, the ‘Nun Bun phenomenon’.  Paul McInnes, 42, who works at traffic management company Metro Traffic Services, is among them. He found his name brought up on The Jonathan Ross Show last March after finding Harry Styles in a slab of bacon. To his friends, he’s the ‘bacon whisperer’ and he’s since seen bacon that looks a fair bit like Noel and Liam Gallagher from Oasis. (According to Paul, at least.) ‘It has only been people’s faces I’ve been,’ Paul says. ‘I have a pretty good imagination and have studied art at college which is where I think I get this from. ‘I am always looking at things differently and critically with my artist’s eye.’ Indeed, our brains – even those without art degrees – have a brilliant ability to recognise faces. Your grey matter can identify a face in a few thousandths of a second, same goes for recognising familiar animals. But why is it that some steam on a teaspoon is the spitting image of Freddie Mercury, or why was one man convinced the grease on his fish and chip wrapping had a striking resemblance to the singer Lewis Capaldi?

Behind this are specialist neurons that, when you see a face, shoot off electric signals with glee. Some experts know them as ‘Jennifer Anniston’ cells after the face cells of an epilepsy patient undergoing surgery in 2005 fired off when seeing a photo of the actor – but couldn’t have cared less when seeing images of Brad Pitt. All these face cells call the ‘fusiform face area’ of the brain home, according to brain-imaging scans, though it’s more of a team effort. ‘There isn’t just one bit of the brain that does this but rather a distributed network of brain areas that work together to be especially sensitive to processing faces,’ Punit Shah, a psychologist at the University of Bath, explains. ‘We know this because if some of these areas get brain damaged, face processing suffers, as well seeing this range of brain regions light up – when we put research participants in brain scanners and show them fac...",0

Empowering women in tech: Insights from Harvard WECode attendees,2024-02-25T15:00:48+00:00,https://depauliaonline.com/68630/artslife/empowering-women-in-tech-insights-from-harvard-wecode-attendees/,"Students from universities across the country, including DePaul, attended the WECode conference, a celebration of women in technology at Harvard University in Boston.  The diverse group of attendees included Brianna Yanqui, a sophomore computer science major from the University of Florida, who was among those who found the experience transformative.   “I had never attended a conference before and wanted WECode to be my first experience,” Yanqui said. Yanqui expressed excitement for the “Just Machine Learning” talk, led by Tina Eliassi-Rad, a computer scientist and professor at Northeastern University. Eliassi-Rad detailed on complex systems and how studying these systems and their processes gives us insights into the potential risks and harms of using machine learning. “Attending ‘Just Machine Learning’ really brought out my interest in AI and machine learning, so I am now hoping to get some research experience within those realms!” Yanqui said.  Paloma Santos, a DePaul junior who is majoring in computer science with a minor in UX design, said the conference provided valuable challenges.  “WECode will contribute to my personal growth by putting me outside my comfort zone and pushing me to interact and meet new people,” Santos said. Santos said the conference was also a chance to connect with other female and nonbinary attendees in an often male-dominated field.  “It can be very challenging to persist in a field that makes me feel isolated and question my self-worth daily,” Santos said. “I thought that it would be life-changing for me to learn that I am not alone in my journey.” Cynthia Luna, a DePaul sophomore and information technology major, said she was eager to attend WECode, to hear some of the speakers. WECode has been a student-led conference since 2014. Luna said she enjoyed hearing from keynote speaker Elizabeth Mynatt, dean of Khoury College of Computer Sciences, and Kristin Austin, vice president of Inclusion, Diversity, Ideas and Access at Rewriting the Code, an organization committed to empowering women in tech. “Harvard WECode helped contribute to my personal growth by inspiring me to aim higher,” Luna said. “It has also helped me with my professional growth as I made connections with some wonderful, intelligent women and learned new things at sessions.”   Luna’s will highlights the significant impact of organizations such as Harvard WECode, showcasing their role as drivers for individual growth and career advancement, echoing the transformative abilities of determination and strength. “It was truly inspiring to see such accomplished women in the tech field sharing their expertise,” Santos added.

"Education empowerment: Seplat trains over 350 teachers in Edo, Delta",2024-02-25T14:11:56+00:00,https://tribuneonlineng.com/education-empowerment-seplat-trains-over-350-teachers-in-edo-delta/,"Another set of 350 teachers in Edo and Delta States on Saturday graduated from the Seplat JV Energy education empowerment programme in its host communities. The teachers, who were drawn from public and private schools in the two states, were trained in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) under the Seplat Teachers Empowerment Programme (STEP). The training which was done in collaboration with NNPC limited, was geared towards equipping the teachers with skills to effectively deliver STEAM knowledge to the students. Speaking at the teachers’ graduation ceremony and Education Summit jointly organised by Seplat JV and NNPCL, Seplat Director, External Affairs and Sustainability, Chioma Afe, said that the education value chain played a crucial role in shaping the workforce and fostering economic development. Afe reiterated that collective efforts were vital in building a skilled and productive workforce, adding that despite efforts to increase access to quality education, disparities in resources persisted across different regions, particularly in secondary education. “We want to address the challenges within the education value chain, especially in the areas where Seplat and NNPC operate, as well as across the nation. “At the foundation of the education value chain lies primary and secondary education, crucial for laying the groundwork for future learning. “However, access to quality early education, especially in rural areas, remains a challenge, Afe said. According to her, collaboration between the private sector, educational institutions, and the government was essential to improve the quality of teaching and learning outcomes. Earlier, the Chief Operating Officer, Seplat JV, Mr Samson Ezugworie said, Seplat recognised the problem and the need to confront it head-on. Ezugworie noted that the country’s education system today was not where it should be adding that, Seplat understood its pivotal role in development. “If the youths of this country are not developed, there’s a problem. “This shared drive among Seplat, our senior partners, and the state governments in the areas we operate is what propels us forward,” he said. Also, Dr. Joan Ovaiwe, Edo State Commissioner for Education, in her goodwill message, thanked Seplat JV Energy and NNPCL for supporting teachers in Edo and Delta Ovaiwe noted that, under the leadership of Governor Godwin Obaseki, Edo State had focused on education reform for the past seven years through Edo Best framework. The Keynote speaker, Akinyele Akin-Olusoji, the Group Managing Director NewGlobe, said there was compelling evidence that improved quality of education, would produce a more educated and skilled labour force. Speaking on the theme, transforming the theme, “Education Workforce: a Critical Success Factor to Nation Building,” Akin-Olusoji said an improved education system would accelerate the growth in GDP each year by 0.5% at the minimum.

"How Nigeria can overcome security, economic challenges, save the Naira — NASENI ex-EVC",2024-02-25T13:51:17+00:00,https://tribuneonlineng.com/how-nigeria-can-overcome-security-economic-challenges-save-the-naira-naseni-ex-evc/,"A former Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI), Prof. Mohammad Sani Haruna, has advocated the deployment of technical education, saying only technical education can help Nigeria to overcome its security and economic challenges. According to Professor Haruna, it is possible to save the Naira from continue depreciation when the nation returns to manufacturing with local raw materials, calling for the adoption of the Asian Tiger model to attain industrial development. Haruna made the submissions in a paper at the maiden convocation of the Federal Polytechnic, Daura. According to him, “technical education is as important in our national life today next to only food security and the nation security. “In fact, technical education is part of the solution to our security challenges and economic woes. The others include qualitative leadership and unity. “As a nation, we are now at crossroads to get it right; and consistently so because development in cutting edge technologies better known as frontier technologies have shown tendencies to widen the socio-economic gaps between the advanced and developing nations in one hand; and between the third world and developing countries on the other hand. “These technologies include artificial intelligence; robotics; the internet of things (IoT); big data; block chain; additive manufacturing; autonomous vehicles; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); gene editing; 5G network; and the recent innovation of the high-efficient solar cell that can produce a thousand times more power than silicon based solar cells. “Despite the opportunities and high potentials of sustainable development brought about by these elements of the fourth industrial revolution, they risk increasing the inequalities by escalating and creating new digital divides between “the technology haves and the have nots”.
This means we can remain only consumer nations for generations after generations and perhaps until the end of time.” Haruna cited examples of many countries with technological breakthrough with limited resources. He said: “ Indeed, countries without natural resources even with regular disasters and extreme weather conditions are among the developed nations due to deployment of science, technology, and innovation. For instance, Japan experiences an aver- age of six earthquakes per annum. They also annually experience typhoons, floods, landslides, had the most devasting tsunami among others. Yet they import raw materials from elsewhere and with value addition generate more profits due to know- how than the country of origin of these raw materials. “And in the case of Nigeria, we export crude oil and other commodity and import the finished products in trade deficit because our imports outshine our exports. “Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET) has been recognised as instrumental towards making extraordinary contributions to industries and technological wo...",0

The Science Behind Silver Testing: How Experts Assess Value,2024-02-25T12:21:44+00:00,https://guanabee.com/the-science-behind-silver-testing-how-experts-assess-value/,"Testing the purity and content of silver items is both an art and a science. When it comes to this precious metal, appearances can be deceptive. In order to ensure customers can make informed decisions, experts employ rigorous testing methodologies. This article delves into the sophisticated technologies that leading professionals (such as silver buyers like Muzeum) use today. Ultimately, if you’re hoping to receive a precise evaluation of your silver, it’s essential to rely on expertise in the field. Table of Contents Evaluating silver has a long history and was essential to ancient economies and societies. During the Byzantine Empire, stringent purity standards were set, leading to the inception of hallmarking in the 14th century. By the Renaissance, hallmarking was a refined system, with guilds and assayers certifying silver items’ fineness through unique marks, indicative of their origin and craftsmanship, offering both consumer protection and trade standards. One of the most advanced technologies used in the analysis of silver is X-ray fluorescence (XRF). XRF technology uses X-rays to excite the atoms in a sample, prompting them to emit secondary (and fluorescent) X-rays. Each element, such as silver, gold, or copper, emits X-rays at unique energies. By detecting these energies, an XRF machine can determine the precise composition of metal alloys. This scientific technique offers a quick analysis of the exact metallic makeup of a silver item. XRF machines are preferred in the industry not only for their precision but also because the item being tested remains undamaged, preserving its aesthetic and monetary value. Moreover, XRF machines are a world apart in sophistication from the magnifying glasses used by silver analysts of the past. Yet they perpetuate the commitment to accuracy in determining the value of these precious items. XRF technology is capable of detecting and quantifying the presence of other metals, which helps professionals verify whether a piece is sterling silver (contains 92.5% silver content). Besides XRF, experts also rely on hallmark identification. These tiny stamps or markings provide a wealth of information about an item’s provenance, age, and purity. However, hallmarks can sometimes be forged and are often worn down over time. XRF analysis assists in confirming the authenticity of these hallmarks to corroborate the item’s purity. As mentioned above, it’s best to rely on experts in the field if you want an accurate assessment of any hallmark on your items. Before a piece reaches the XRF machine, it can be subjected to preliminary tests. Magnet testing is one effective and simple method, taking advantage of silver’s non-magnetic nature. If the item is attracted to a magnet, it’s likely not solid silver. Additionally, experts assess signs of wear and examine the item’s scent: true silver doesn’t emit a metallic odor like other metals. Of course, passing a magnet test does not completely guarantee an item is made of sil...",0
Pierre Gasly & Esteban Ocon Expose Otmar Szafnauer’s Critical Fault That Caused Alpine to Fire Him,2024-02-25T12:21:33+00:00,https://www.essentiallysports.com/f1-news-pierre-gasly-esteban-ocon-expose-otmar-szafnauer-s-critical-fault-that-caused-alpine-to-fire-him/,"Latest NBA NFL NASCAR Golf Tennis ES Fancast Latest NBA NFL NASCAR Golf Tennis ES Fancast Home F1 Follow Us via Imago Image courtesy: Imago
L: Esteban Ocon
M: Otmar Szafnauer
R: Pierre Gasly “BWT Alpine F1 Team announces today it will part ways with Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer by mutual agreement following the 2023 Belgian Grand Prix.” On the Friday of F1’s 2023 trip to Spa-Francorchamps, Alpine put out this statement. However, in doing so, it broke a promise made to Szafnauer. 100 races. That’s how long Alpine management gave Szafnauer to get the team to the front of the grid. But even before he reached the 40-race mark, he got his two days’ notice. As it turns out, Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon pointed out just where their boss was going wrong even before his sacking. In the 7th episode of Drive to Survive: Season 6, the focus is on Alpine. The Enstone-Viry team came into 2023 after quite an impressive 2022 season. The team finished P4 in the Constructors’ Championship, and their aim for last season was to match that – or better it. So, before the season started, Szafnauer stated, “We have just under 80 races left on this mission. I have high expectations from everyone in the team who will work collaboratively to deliver the best possible results for the team.” While his drivers were doing all they could, Szafnauer wasn’t living up to the high expectations he’d set. Two races before the Belgian GP, Pierre Gasly told Netflix, “Something is not clicking somewhere. Clearly, the communication hasn’t been to the best level.” Explaining the core issue, he added, “I think it’s very important, as a team principal, to understand what your drivers actually need. So now [we] need to do the work and deliver.” The Frenchman evidently wasn’t happy with how things were moving, especially when it came to getting what he wanted. And Esteban Ocon had something similar to say. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The main problem, according to Ocon, was the management not listening to the drivers. “It’s important to work well, you know, inside the team. To have a close relationship, in a way. To talk about the things that are important. At the moment, we are not doing that. No one is happy inside the team. I think Otmar needs to find out some solutions.” After all, communication is key. But that’s precisely what Szafnauer couldn’t master, considering it’s the team principal’s job to make sure the drivers get what they need to perform. via Imago 10 Pierre Gasly FRA, BWT Alpine F1 Team, F1 Grand Prix of Italy at Autodromo Nazionale Monza on August 31, 2023 in Monza, Italy.

            Do you treat student evaluations seriously?             Sorry, there was an error loading this poll. Rafiat Yarrow, a senior political science major, was named Miss Black EIU 2024.  After a year off, the Miss Black EIU returned Saturday night with three contestants: Destinee Patterson, junior secondary education and English language arts major, Rafiat Yarrow, senior political science major, and Samaria Rosenthal, senior psychology major.   The pageant was judged by six judges and were judged based off of four categories:  Dating back to 1971, Miss Black EIU has been Eastern’s longest cultural tradition.  During the event, Yarrow expressed her feelings and personal connection to anxiety through a spoken word poetry performance.  The pageant was hosted by Sheldon Turner, a sophomore accounting major, and Amari Hurn, a senior computer and information technology major.  Yarrow said it felt “surreal” to win the award. She, alongside Patterson and Rosenthal, have been working on and practicing for the pageant for the last month.  She plans on promoting Miss Black EIU to other women in Eastern’s community.  Yarrow’s brother Raqeeb Yarrow attended the event, unaware of what he was showing up for.  He said that Rafiat Yarrow just told him to come, and the event was a surprise to him, which he enjoyed nonetheless.  He drove from Chicago for the surprise. He said it was definitely worth it.  Yarrow is also a member of Zeta Phi Beta, and her sorority sisters came out to support her.  Rochelle Carter, a sophomore nursing major also in Zeta Phi Beta, said she felt inspired by Yarrow’s victory.  “Just seeing her getting this award and getting the scholarship, winning the scholarship pageant, it’s just really inspiring just to show that I can do more on camps as well and follow in those footsteps in a Zeta life,” Carter said.  Yarrow had been talking to her sorority sisters prior to the event and was feeling stressed, according to Carter.  Carter said hearing Yarrow’s name called “was kind of a sense of relief.”     Cam’ron Hardy can be reached at 581-2812 or at [email protected].  The student news site of Eastern Illinois University in Charleston, Illinois.",0

Revolutionary Brain Stimulation Technique Shows Promise For Treating Brain Disorders,2024-02-24T23:49:56+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdfGlOZF6Ig8PnNuMIJyU22,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   The human brain By Eurasia Review  The human brain’s adaptability to internal and external changes, known as neural plasticity, forms the foundation for understanding cognitive functions like memory and learning, as well as various neurological disorders. New research conducted by a team led by Dr. PARK Joo Min of the Center for Cognition and Sociality within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) unveils a novel technique that could transform the treatment landscape for brain disorders. The team developed a non-invasive brain stimulation method called Patterned Low-Intensity Low-Frequency Ultrasound (LILFUS), which holds tremendous potential for inducing long-lasting changes in brain function. Traditionally, magnetic and electrical brain stimulation methods have been used to modulate brain function. However, these methods come with inherent limitations that restrict their spatial resolution and penetration depth, making it challenging to precisely stimulate specific brain regions with optimal efficacy. More invasive methods, such as those that require surgical procedures, exhibit superior control and therapeutic effects for specific deep brain stimulation, but they come with risks such as tissue damage, inflammation, and infection. These limitations have fueled the search for alternative approaches that can overcome these constraints and provide more efficient and precise modulation of brain function. In the latest study unveiled by the IBS, researchers used ultrasound to enable precise stimulation of specific brain areas. Unlike electromagnetic waves, ultrasound has the advantage of being able to penetrate deep into the brain tissues. The researchers discovered that ultrasound stimulation can modulate neural plasticity – the brain’s ability to rewire itself – through the activation of key molecular pathways. Specifically, the study pinpointed the ultrasound’s effect on mechanosensitive calcium channels in astrocytes, which controls the cells’ ability to uptake calcium and release neurotransmitters. LILFUS was designed based on specific ultrasound parameters that mimic the brainwave patterns of theta (5 Hz) and gamma (30 Hz) oscillations observed during learning and memory processes. The new tool allowed the researchers to either activate or deactivate specific brain regions at will – intermittent delivery of the ultrasound was found to induce long-term potentiation effects, while continuous patterns resulted in long-term depression effects. One of the most promising aspects of this new technology is its ability to facilitate the acquisition of new motor skills. When the researchers delivered ultrasound stimulation to the cerebral motor cortex in mice, they observed significant improvements in motor skill learning and the ability to retrieve food. Interestingly, researchers were even able to change the forelimb preference of the mice. This suggests potential applications in rehabilitation therapies for stroke sur...",0
New Study Unveil East Asian Apring Climate Influencers,2024-02-24T23:43:53+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfOEjxLN-cv9wX50KYzL9tX,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   Schematic plot of the physical mechanisms of the persistent EAT anomaly in March-April. CREDIT: IAP By Eurasia Review  In a study recently published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, researchers from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have revealed significant relationships between March and April variations in the East Asian trough (EAT). This atmospheric phenomenon, akin to a persistent low-pressure belt, acts as a crucial player in determining East Asian climate and weather during the crucial spring months. Spring marks a crucial transitional period in East Asian atmospheric circulation, where different evolutions of the intraseasonal-scale circulation anomalies give rise to various climate anomalies. Seasonal averages often fall short in effectively capturing the evolving characteristics of monthly-scale circulation, presenting challenges in understanding and predicting East Asian spring climate anomalies. The research team identified a persistent mode of EAT month-to-month variation in March-April, accompanied by long-lasting climate anomalies such as air temperature and precipitation over the region. Delving into the potential mechanisms behind the persistent EAT anomaly in March-April, the scientists pinpointed culprits, including: Persistent dipole sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the mid-latitude North Atlantic, capable of triggering Rossby wave trains that influence the EAT during March-April; a tropical Indian SST anomaly, influencing Walker circulation and lower tropospheric atmospheric circulation in the western Pacific, significantly impacting the southern part of the EAT; and continuous snow cover anomalies in Northeast Asia, altering local thermodynamic properties and favoring the persistence of northern EAT anomalies during March-April. “Remarkably, signals of these impact factors could be traced back to February,” noted Prof. SUN Jianqi, the corresponding author of the study. “These signals offer a valuable temporal window for predicting persistent East Asian climate anomalies in spring.” This newfound understanding holds the potential to improve the accuracy of regional climate predictions, thereby contributing to more effective disaster prevention and mitigation efforts.

			Trending:		 I had no intention of going into science. In my early teens, I wanted to be a jockey and was firmly convinced I would never weigh more than 100 pounds. I quickly exceeded that weight cap and switched my interests to high school drama. Theater beckoned but I had no acting talent. I took four years of math just because my parents said I should, but never talked about math grades because I didn’t want anyone to think I was a geek. I arrived at UC Berkeley in the fall of 1964. Like many freshmen, I had little idea of a major. The excitement of the Free Speech Movement swept over campus early that term and other than being sure we could change the world, I have few memories of the classes I took. In those days, Berkeley had the enlightened policy of no major declarations until junior year. I dabbled in humanities, tried journalism but decided I didn’t like talking to strangers and thought about teaching until I took one Ed course that was dreadful. I loved art history but couldn’t see a viable career path. Sciences were required, and took botany my first year and, holding my nose, opted for geology the beginning of the next. I’m not sure what I expected. I grew up thinking of geology as a dry dusty field where anything of interest had been discovered years ago. Was I ever in for a surprise. Two things conspired to make it a life-changing experience. The first was the instructor. Professor Howell Williams was a volcanologist who uncovered the explosive story of Crater Lake in the 1940s. It was his last year of teaching and, as a result of a spat with the department chair, was assigned the “rocks for jocks” class. Williams’ response to the perceived punishment was to teach it just like the majors’ intro class. Many of the 600 in the class hated it – nothing like the easy “A” they expected. For me it was wonderful, unveiling a new planet as I had never seen Earth before. He emphasized that visualization, aesthetics, and imagination were as important as data and algorithms in understanding geologic processes. The second factor was an earth sciences revolution. 1964 was the dawning of plate tectonics and Professor Williams was an early believer. Only a few accepted it at the time, and he gave us a ...",0

'Deeply flawed': Ex-prosecutor dismantles Trump’s latest immunity argument,2024-02-24T18:51:47+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/deeply-flawed-trump-immunity/,"According to former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance, Donald Trump's appeal to Judge Aileen Cannon that charges of obstructing justice brought by special counsel Jack Smith should be dismissed because he has presidential immunity is so deeply ""flawed"" it shouldn't even be considered. Speaking with MSNBC host Katie Phang, the legal analyst pointed out it was another obvious ploy to delay his trial. ""He [Trump] also raised an interesting argument that he declassified the classified materials, with his mind, of course, the Jedi mind trick that he does,"" host Phang began, ""and then he made them personal records, so he's able to take them wherever the hell he wanted to. Talk about that."" ""Yeah, so this argument is flawed, it is deeply flawed,"" Vance replied. ""For one thing at best, it would apply to the charges in the indictment that he took the documents from the White House with him. They don't have any force against the obstruction charges."" ALSO READ: 11 ways Trump doesn't become president ""But they're more deeply flawed than that, to the extent that he suggests that he had the power to do this,"" she continued. ""You know, you can't convert classified material into some sort of personal property of a president or something covered by the Presidential Records Act and this motion has only one purpose. it will come as no surprise to you, Katie. it is to delay the proceedings because in the hands of Judge Aileen Cannon, who's not shown a willingness to move quickly."" ""She can sit on this motion for some period of time and it will likely be one of the nails in the coffin that removes this case from a trial track for May,"" she predicted.Watch below or at the link.

Superspy Science: Scientist debunks some of the weirdest and wackiest plot lines in James Bond blockbusters - including whether being covered in gold paint really will kill you,2024-02-24T17:10:24+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-13108307/scientist-debunks-plot-lines-James-Bond.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By Jonathan Chadwick For Mailonline    Published:  13:23, 24 February 2024   |  Updated:  17:15, 24 February 2024      36 View  comments  From lethal laser beams to ladies covered in gold paint, the James Bond films surely include some of the most spectacular set pieces in modern cinema.  But often, even die-hard Bond fans are left wondering if the various stunts and plot lines in the beloved blockbusters are based in reality.  Thankfully, a new book finally separates the scientifically accurate from the utterly fantastical. Dr Kathryn Harkup, a British chemist and author, has studied all 25 James Bond films made by Eon Productions, starting from 1962's 'Dr No' up to 2021's 'No Time to Die'.  In the book, she debunks some of the weirdest and wackiest set pieces involving the fictional spy, while others, she says, are surprisingly scientifically sound.  From being cut by lasers and electrocuted by headphones, a chemist reveals whether plot lines in James Bond films are actually scientifically sound  Researchers found many travel related health threats experienced by James Bond SUFFOCATION BY GOLD PAINT Surely one of the most memorable scenes in the whole James Bond franchise comes in 'Goldfinger' (1964).  In a Florida hotel, Bond (played by Sean Connery) finds the dead body of Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton) who has been coated from head to toe in gold paint.  In the following scene, Bond explains to his superior M at MI6 that humans suffocate if the body is painted unless 'you leave a small bare patch at the base of the spine to allow the skin to breathe'.  But as Dr Harkup reveals, despite the common assumption by Bond fans, this is not scientifically accurate at all.  In actual fact, only about 2 per cent of the body's oxygen supply is absorbed through the skin – so blocking it with paint wouldn't stop us from breathing.  The only way we'd suffocate from paint is if it obstructed our major breathing pathways – the mouth and the nose.  Dr Harkup says: 'The image of Masterson's gold body lying on the hotel bed has become ingrained in popular culture and the idea of being killed by skin suffocation has become accepted as fact, even though it is nonsense.'  More than 40 years later, the scene was recreated in the 2008 Bond film 'Quantum of Solace' starring Daniel Craig.  In 'Goldfinger' (1964), Bond (played by Sean Connery) finds the dead body of Jill Masterson (played by Shirley Eaton) - who has been suffocated by having her skin painted gold  Dr Kathryn Harkup tackles all 25 Bond films in her new book, Superspy Science: Science, Death and Tech in the World of James Bond In a nod to the original scene, Bond finds MI6 agent and love interest Strawberry Fields dead and covered in crude oil. However, considering the character was drowned in the oil rather than just being covered in it, this scene is more credible. DEATHLY LASERS  Later in Goldfinger, Bond wakes up to find himself strapped to a table by the film's eponymous villain, played by Gert Fröb...",0

 With multiple tagged instances of a variable.  Instead of a clean 64 bit int, now your ""int"" is a hashtable. This isn't time travel. Any credible news on Chris's whereabouts these days? Well I have yet to see proof. But he has been uncharacteristically silent. That is not the Chris way for sure. Explain how you think this is actually implemented then if you don't think this is just memory bloat, not actually time travel. You think they managed to create FTL travel inside your computer to have a light signal travel back and forward in time to get values in memory at different times ? Of course not.  When you say x = 1, it adds x to a hashtable in the default position.  When you then say t = now, it creates a timestamp label named t.  When you say ""as of t, x = 2"", all it does is insert 2 in the x hashtable in the t position, using the earlier created label. Ain't no magic dude, it's computers. Well, one approach is for the compiler to handle the ""now()"" as a sort of sync point keyword. It then reorders the instructions accordingly. Other approaches might include virtual closures, similar to how a single JavaScript async function under the hood looks more like multiple chained functions sharing a closure scope. > It then reorders the instructions accordingly. Which would mean copying instructions in multiple place, sort of like a loop unroll, resulting in a bigger executable and thus still more memory usage. No, you'd just run over the code with a preprocessor and untangle it. > Explain how you think this is actually implemented then if you don't think this is just memory bloat, not actually time travel. You can't get something from nothing.  Otherwise I could store data in ""time"" instead of space for free.  Putting that aside, the important question is even with the memory bloat are there use cases for this?  I wouldn't expect an entire software platform to use this but maybe functions or code blocks where undoing operations make sense? To me this seems like one of those really nasty bugs you'd get that causes crashes and security issues.

"‘Break down barriers’: Manitoba Alpine offering free sit-ski lessons, lift ticket this March",2024-03-04T23:58:34+00:00,https://globalnews.ca/news/10334576/manitoba-alpine-free-sit-ski-lessons/,"Instructions: Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first.

At the base of Holiday Mountain in La Rivière, Man., Kyle Calder straps himself into a sit-ski. He slips on his outriggers, digs them into the snow and makes his way to the lift. “My progression has been pretty good,” Calder said. By the way he moves, it would hard to know Calder only learned to sit-ski a week ago. He fearlessly carves his way down the hill, looking for any air he can get. “I needed to get out and try something different,” he said. Calder lost part of his right leg from a cancer diagnosis of osteosarcoma in 2018. He now has a prosthetic and embraces life to the fullest. “Everything’s all good as far as cancer’s concerned. I kicked its butt and now just looking to do new things and create new opportunities,” Calder said. Calder’s positive outlook is what led him to the slopes. His friend and ski instructor Chris Maxemuck told him about a new opportunity through Manitoba Alpine. The organization is offering a free lesson, lift ticket and rentals for those interested in learning how to para-ski. The experience that would typically cost $250. “Outside of mobility issues, that’s probably one of the bigger concerns,” Calder said. “The financial burden of things.” Calder took Maxemuck up on the offer and just over a week ago, the two met for a lesson. Now, Calder’s hooked and Maxemuck is determined to help others. “Adaptive skiing is relatively new to Manitoba, ” Maxemuck said. Maxemuck first got a taste for the sport while working with Rocky Mountain Adaptive in Alberta. It made him want to provide the same experience to Manitobans. He’s passionate about growing the sport by teaching adaptive skiing to people like Calder so they can zip down the slopes independently. “Skiing is a very social activity,” Maxemuck said. “This leads to group engagement and a sense of community, which leads to improved physical and mental well-being.” Maxemuck isn’t the only one trying to grow adaptive skiing. Winnipegger and Invictus Games athlete Lealand Muller wants to see the sport as a whole become more accessible. “Being a wheelchair user, there’s a little more logistics involved in planning a ski trip,” Muller said. The next Invictus Games are in British Columbia in 2025, where adaptive downhill skiing will be added for the first time. Muller wants to be involved in making those games more accessible. He has booked an adaptive ski trip in Banff, Alta., this week and is looking forward to learning what is needed to make alpine sports an option for people with physical disabilities. “I have been assured it’s accessible but it will be up to me to make that final decision on how accessible it is and what can be improved upon going forward,” Muller said. As for the free opportunity to learn adaptive skiing in Manitoba, Maxemuck is urging people with disabiliti...",0

Primary 2024: Where the leading NC gubernatorial candidates stand on climate change,2024-03-04T23:52:57+00:00,https://www.wral.com/story/primary-2024-where-the-leading-nc-gubernatorial-candidates-stand-on-climate-change/21312887/,"Ahead of Tuesday’s primary, North Carolina is set to host one of the most pivotal governor’s races in the country. Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein and Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson are leading in the polls to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The stakes are high, locally and nationally. State Republicans are in solid control of the state Legislature, with an opportunity to win a trifecta in November. North Carolina is one of just two battleground states in the 11 gubernatorial elections on the ballot this year.During Cooper’s time in office, he pushed several initiatives to fight climate change and incentivize a clean energy transition in the state, including Executive Order No. 246 establishing goals of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.Public opinion and scientific consensus overwhelmingly agree on the issue of climate change. According to a recent Yale/George Mason climate opinion survey, 71% of North Carolinians of all political backgrounds believe climate change is happening and more than half believe humans are the cause. More than 99.9% of peer-reviewed scientific papers agree that climate change is mainly caused by the burning of fossil fuels, according to a survey of 88,125 climate-related studies.Here’s where the leading candidates stand on the issue:Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson (R)Robinson, endorsed by former President Donald Trump, called climate change “junk science” in a campaign speech in Hickory last year. He called educators who teach climate science “liars” and ridiculed scientists: “Stop talking to me about climate change. I know the climate changes, it happens four times a year, it’s called seasons.”He says he plans to “keep the climate change cabal out of this state and if they are in [the] state, keeping them in chains.”Attorney General Josh Stein (D)“We're living in a global climate emergency, and we need to take swift action to protect our planet for our kids and future generations,” said Attorney General Josh Stein.Attorney General Josh Stein filed testimony in 2022 with the North Carolina Utilities Commission calling for a stronger and more affordable clean energy approach than the one proposed by Duke Energy. Stein has called for an alternative carbon plan that would dramatically reduce carbon emissions in the state over the next six years and achieve net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. He’s also supported incentives for rooftop solar.“North Carolina is shaping its clean energy future – one that is better for our economy, our wallets, and our environment,” said Attorney General Josh Stein. During Cooper’s time in office, he pushed several initiatives to fight climate change and incentivize a clean energy transition in the state, including Executive Order No. 246 establishing goals of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.Public opinion and scientific consensus overwhelmingly agree on the issue of clim...",0
Antarctica’s Coasts Are Becoming Less Icy,2024-03-04T23:07:30+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeKP08pMLSwyd3hDS9njgCr,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   Antarctica CREDIT: Ceridwen Fraser By Eurasia Review  An increase in pockets of open water in Antarctica’s sea ice (polynyas) may mean coastal plants and animals could one day establish on the continent, University of Otago-led research suggests. The research, published in the prestigious international journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, aimed at understanding where open water might allow coastal species to settle in the future. Led by Research Fellow Dr Grant Duffy from Otago’s Department of Marine Science, the team found unexpected evidence the area of polynyas around Antarctica is increasing dramatically, and it follows an intriguing cycle, growing and shrinking roughly every 16 years. “These trends are fascinating – and we haven’t noticed them before,” Dr Duffy says. “We’re not completely sure what is driving the cyclical pattern, but the ecological implications could be huge.” Co-author Dr Ariaan Purich, a scientist at Monash University in Australia who studies ocean-atmosphere interactions, says the cyclical patterns appear to line up with atmospheric drivers including the Southern Annular Mode, a climate phenomenon that circles Antarctica and influences weather in New Zealand and Australia. “Recent record low Antarctic sea ice coverage has been linked with ocean warming,” Dr Purich says. “In coastal environments, large-scale atmospheric variability and trends can interact with changing ocean conditions to shape the extent of sea ice. These findings give us exciting insights that will help us predict coastal sea ice coverage in the future.” The senior author on the study, Professor Ceridwen Fraser, also of the Department of Marine Science, says the results are also critically important for predicting what will happen to coastal ecosystems in Antarctica as the climate warms. “We know that many non-native plants and animals can reach Antarctica, for example by rafting on floating kelp,” Professor Fraser says. “At the moment, most of them can’t settle because of coastal ice scour. Less ice could create opportunities for some coastal plants and animals to establish – with big implications for native Antarctic coastal ecosystems.” Dr Duffy agrees. “Our research shows that areas of open water along Antarctic coasts, in particular, are growing in area as the climate warms,” he says. “These changing coastal environments will mean ecosystems have to adapt and change.” The study was supported by the Marsden Fund of New Zealand, and researchers involved in the work are part of the major national Antarctic programmes Securing Antarctica’s Environmental Future, Australia and Antarctic Science Platform, New Zealand.

Kallie Moore, co-host of the PBS Digital Studios channel “Eons,” professional fossil librarian and the author of a new children’s book about prehistoric life is the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s Sharon Dunwoody Science Journalist in Residence this spring. From March 12 to 14, Moore will visit campus to share her expertise in digital content creation and science communication with students in journalism and communication courses. On March 13 from 7 to 8 p.m. she will provide a behind-the-scenes look at her work as a professional YouTuber and science communicator for PBS “Eons” at Wisconsin Institute for Discovery’s monthly lecture series, Crossroads of Ideas. The talk, “Can You Dig It,” will be held in the DeLuca Forum at the Discovery Building, 330 North Orchard St. The Crossroads of Ideas series is free and open to the public. Registration is requested. Moore has co-hosted PBS’s paleontology-focused digital show “Eons” since its inception in 2017. The channel has nearly 3 million subscribers on YouTube and features deeply researched short episodes that investigate scientific questions about life on Earth, from the dawn of living organisms through the age of dinosaurs all the way to the end of the most recent ice age. Topics Moore has tackled for “Eons” include how and why giraffes’ long necks emerged, how chilis became spicy (and why humans love them), the evolutionary origin of bats and when fish first breathed air some 385 million years ago. In addition to sharing evolutionary tales on “Eons,” Moore serves as Collections Manager for the University of Montana Paleontology Center, where she preserves and organizes the center’s large fossil collection and coordinates public outreach events, among other duties. In 2022, Moore also became a published author with the publication of “Tales of the Prehistoric World: Adventures from the Land of the Dinosaurs.” The children’s nonfiction book, illustrated by Becky Thorns and published by Neon Squid, features thrilling stories about creatures from the deep past told via the fossilized remains they’ve left behind. The UW–Madison Science Journalist in Residence program was founded in 1986 and is hosted by the School of Journalism and Mass Communication and University Communications.

Modi Prefers the Science Route to Viksit Bharat: Union ministers,2024-03-04T21:12:20+00:00,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/news/modi-prefers-the-science-route-to-viksit-bharat-union-ministers-884236,"Hyderabad: ‘Viksit Bharat’ can be realised only by actively imbibing a science culture  among children, students and youth of the country, believes the Narendra Modi  government. It is setting  up science experience centres (SEC) all over the  country and the first such unit is coming up in Telangana in  pursuit of the target of Viksit Bharat, said Union minister  for science and technology Dr. Jitendra Singh.     He was addressing a gathering after  laying a foundation stone for SEC at the Indian Institute of  Chemical Technology (IICT) premises in Tarnaka along with his cabinet colleague  G. Kishan Reddy, here on Monday. Dr. Singh underscored the need to  synergise several research institutes and laboratories working under the  Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) to bolster ease  of living of people. The research institutes must reach out to the masses,  particularly students to educate them about the importance of science.   The SEC to be built by the  National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) at a cost of `41 crore is  jointly promoted by the Union ministries of culture and science  and technology. Presently, NCSM runs 26 SECs and museums in  different states. Kishan Reddy urged the state government  to provide land to upgrade the city’s science experience centre into a science  city in Hyderabad. It was delayed due to the delay by the state government, he  said. He pointed out that eventually, it was the ministry of science and  Technology that had come forward to provide the land in its research institute  inside IICT premises. Stating that no country can get the  desired results without a clear target and focus, Reddy said that  Prime  Minister Narendra Modi has set a mission for the research community and  institutes of higher learning to chalk out a clear action plan to realize the  dream of Viksit Bharat by 2047.  “When the entire country is in election  mode, the Prime Minister was recently engaged in an eight-hour marathon  discussion with top bureaucrats and experts to develop an action plan to  achieve `Viksit Bharat’,” he said. Hyderabad, which has a number of research  institutes across sectors, has emerged as a hub for science and technology  activity. Setting up a science experience centre and science city will propel  the city as the country’s ‘science capital’, Reddy said.   Dr S. Satheesh Reddy,  former chairman of DRDO, said that startups were picking  up rapidly in the country. Presently 1.14 lakh  startups are operating in the country as against 450 in 2016.   The country ranked third in publishing research papers. CSIR director general Dr. N. Kalaiselvi,  IICT director Srinivas Reddy and Union culture ministry joint  secretary Mugdha Sinha also addressed the meeting.  ",0

Nearly 300 students participate in statewide Science and Engineering Fair in Charleston,2024-03-04T20:20:24+00:00,https://wvmetronews.com/2024/03/04/nearly-300-students-participate-in-statewide-science-and-engineering-fair-in-charleston/,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Nearly 300 third through twelfth grade public school students have come a long way to show off their science, math, and engineering projects during an annual, statewide fair in Charleston. The West Virginia Science and Engineering Fair was held at the Charleston Coliseum and Convention Center Monday where students across eight regions of the state were competing. The fair acts as an entry point for high school students to qualify for the Regeneron International Science Fair in Los Angeles, California in May. An 11th grade student at Spring Mills High School in Martinsburg, Sydney Bostic is already on her way to the international fair. She said it’s an opportunity she has been given throughout her high school career, but Bostic said every year is a new and enlightening experience for her. “It’s so much fun, I’ve been for the past three years and every year I learn something new and I feel like my project upgrades every single time, because I’m able to learn and experience new things with different people from all around the world,” said Bostic. Bostic said her project is called “Bridging the Gap Using EdTech and Artificial Intelligence”. She said the project is focused around an app that she designed that uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) scanning, Translation Application Programming Interfaces, and the A.I chatbot, ChatGPT. Utilizing that technology together, Bostic said the app allows users to translate college-level text into various proficiency levels. “Everybody can use the same materials and learn at the same level at the same time,” she said. Bostic said she has been invested in working with A.I technology and computer coding for a very long time. She said she started on a robotics team called FLL, or First Lego Learning when she was little and has since worked her way to a more advanced version of that team known as FTC, First Tech Challenge. Bostic said she initially became inspired to learn coding from her father who works with computers. “So, it’s just something that has been integrated into my life for so many years and it has just been what I grew up loving to do,” she said. “I’ve continued to upgrade my skills as I’ve grown up.” She said the project took a little over 800 hours to complete after beginning it in May of last year and just finishing it up in January. Bostic said her parents have been a main inspiration for her to continue the project despite how great of a challenge it posed. “They’ve always encouraged me to keep going even if it has been a really long process and sometimes I’ve been really tired, but they have been saying ‘keep going, you’ve got this, this is your passion, if you keep working you will always end up being successful.” Middle school students in Monday’s science fair could qualify for the Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge and the Lemelson Early Inventor Prize. WVDE Director of Pre K-12 Academic Support Erika Klose said approximately 289 students were competing...",0
'The good of the country': Trump explains why he should have immunity,2024-03-04T20:08:38+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/news-politics/trump-immunity/,"Responding to the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling Monday that he can remain on the Colorado ballot after the state, citing the 14th Amendment, removed him for engaging in insurrection, Donald Trump on Monday suggested he should have absolute immunity “for the good of the country and actually the good of the world.” The Supreme Court recently decided to take up Trump’s “absolute immunity” claim, which is tied to Special Prosecutor Jack Smith’s prosecution of Trump for his actions to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. But falling under that argument could be his Espionage Act case against Trump, also referred to as the classified documents case, and indeed, possibly any case against him for his actions while in office. “I don’t want to be prosecuted, because I decided to do something that is very much for the good of the country and actually for the good of the world,” Trump said in his rambling remarks, while talking about fighting ISIS when he was Commander-in-Chief. “We were fighting for 20 years against ISIS. And we did it very quickly. I don’t want to be prosecuted. In that case, it worked out very well. There will be some things that perhaps don’t work out so well, but I don’t want to be prosecuted because I decided to do something that is very much for the good of the country and actually for the good of the world,” Trump said in his remarks. READ MORE: Video Shows 32 Times Trump ‘Babbled Nonsense’ or ‘Got Confused’ in Just One Day Trump’s hypothetical, however, is not why he’s being prosecuted. He is facing a myriad of charges in just the two cases being prosecuted by Special Counsel Jack Smith. But Trump also faces charges in the New York District Attorney’s case, often referred to as the “hush money” case, and in the Fulton County election interference case – none of which have to do with battling terrorists overseas. “A President shouldn’t have that on his mind and he has to have a free and clear mind when he makes very big decisions,” Trump continued, “or it’s going to be nothing more than a ceremonial post. You’ll be president, it’ll be a wonderful thing and you won’t do anything because you don’t want to be hit by your opponent or hit by somebody else because who wants to leave office and go through what I’ve gone through?” No president in U.S. history has been charged with crimes related to his actions while in office. Later in his remarks, as Real Clear Politics reported, Trump went on to say, “you have deranged Jack Smith, who is a Trump hater and represents all the Trump haters, and he’s going wild, wild man and he was just overturned unanimously by the Supreme Court, went after other people and he’s a great failure. He is mean, nasty, unfair.” Smith was not “just overturned unanimously by the Supreme Court.” The Court agreed to take up Trump’s immunity claim, which Smith asked the Court to do in December.

Voters in at least 16 states, including Colorado, had teamed up with organisations to try and remove Mr Trump from their ballots under the 14th Amendment “insurrection clause”. After SCOTUS ruled in his favour on Monday 4 March, a jubilant Mr Trump said: ""If a president doesn’t have full immunity, you really don’t have a president”. On Truth Social, Mr Trump called the decision a “BIG WIN FOR AMERICA!!!” 01:09 00:49 00:36 00:24 03:35 03:45 10:42 36:50 09:14 37:41 07:34 43:16 03:35 03:45 07:34 08:19 05:45 05:34 05:53 04:53 10:42 06:27 07:23 06:35 12:18 11:50 09:03 13:07 04:31 07:30 03:34 03:18 03:21 03:28 04:57 03:47 11:34 11:49 14:24 11:18 14:19 17:13 10:32 42:24 03:11 04:08 03:04 02:44 03:57 03:50 04:11 05:27 09:14 08:18 07:35 11:36 07:22 05:33 09:06 09:54 36:50 37:41 43:16 18:59 01:37 33:36 01:10 44:28 08:49 06:38 03:39 06:50 06:07 04:48 05:57 06:13 00:49 00:35 01:02 00:27 00:56 00:29 00:46 00:25 00:47 00:35 00:34 01:27 00:29 01:19 00:31 00:41 00:44 00:44 01:30 00:31 00:56 00:37 00:34 00:44 00:54 00:33 00:27 01:59 01:17 01:08 01:11 01:27 01:36 00:42 01:26 00:32 00:31 02:00 00:40 00:58 04:23 04:26 04:34 01:01 01:07 01:08 03:13 03:10 02:48 03:12 15:55 16:33 16:06 15:01 15:16 01:16 00:36 00:48 01:08 01:12 01:23 01:24 Live 01:51 02:07 02:00 02:09 01:00:15 02:13 01:55 00:58 Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in",0
New legislation proposed to regulate Colorado Funeral Industry,2024-03-04T18:48:15+00:00,https://krdo.com/news/2024/03/04/new-legislation-proposed-to-regulate-colorado-funeral-industry/,"DENVER, Colo. (KRDO) -- Colorado is the only state in the country that doesn’t regulate funeral home professionals, but that could soon change. On Monday, Republican State Representative Matt Soper and Democrat State Senator Dylan Roberts introduced legislation which would require funeral home professionals to be licensed, including funeral directors, mortuary science practitioners, embalmers, creationists and natural reductionists.  “What we're doing here with licensure, it's about restoring confidence to Colorado's funeral home industry,” Soper said. If passed, the bill would require these professionals to be licensed by Jan. 1, 2026. The requirements to receive a license are extensive. An applicant must graduate from an educational institution of their profession, pass a national industry exam, fulfill a one-year apprenticeship and pass a criminal background check. In the meantime, current funeral home professionals will have to apply for a provisional license to continue to operate. This license requires them to prove to the state they belong in the industry by showing they have 6,500 working hours, have a prior apprenticeship and they too must pass a criminal background check. “It's unrealistic to ask them to go back to school and get a degree and put their business on hold, and then we would likely lose that service in our community,” Roberts said. Since Colorado deregulated in the 1980s, it’s become the only state in the country that doesn’t require licensing for funeral home professionals, leading to multiple funeral home tragedies in the last six years, including Sunset Mesa in Montrose, Return to Nature in Penrose and most recently Apollo in Denver. “We're the only state in America that doesn't require licensure,” Soper said. “That's also why almost all of the horrific stories that we've heard around the nation come out of Colorado.” Soper and Roberts said they worked closely with the Colorado Funeral Directors Association in drafting the bill. The lawmakers said the organization supports licensing to bring integrity and trust to the industry. “These are people that work in the industry and were frankly sick and tired of their reputations being tarnished by these bad actors and these horrible cases” Roberts said. “It's fair to say there is a large portion of the funeral professionals in Colorado that support the idea of licensure.” However, not everyone in the funeral home industry agrees with regulation. Service Corporation International, one of the largest funeral home conglomerates in the country, is expected to lobby against the bill. Soper and Roberts said it’s because SCI believes licensing will increase costs. “We've been working to strike that balance here because we don't want to run good operators out of the industry and we also don't want to make it expensive to bury your loved ones in Colorado,” Soper said. The Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies will oversee and enforce the funeral home industry licensing. On Monday,...",0

Trump says Supreme Court ballot ruling will be remembered for '200 years' and claims he now needs immunity so he can't be prosecuted for defeating ISIS and killing the 'two biggest terrorists in the world' Soleimani and al-Baghdadi,2024-03-04T18:10:52+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13155595/trump-supreme-court-insurrection-mar-lago.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By Rob Crilly, Senior U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com In Washington, D.C.   Published:  18:06, 4 March 2024   |  Updated:  19:03, 4 March 2024      1k View  comments  Former President Donald Trump on Monday welcomed the Supreme Court's decision to reinstate him on presidential ballots as 'well crafted,' saying that it would unify the country.  He thanked the justices for working quickly in delivering a ruling that he said would be remembered for 200 years. And he urged the court to deliver him immunity in the next election case that it will consider, arguing that any other decision would leave him open to prosecution for US military actions that killed senior terrorist leaders in the Middle East.  'You cannot take somebody out of a race,' he said Monday afternoon at his Mar-a-Lago base in Florida. 'The voters can take a person out of the race very quickly. But a court shouldn't be doing that. The Supreme Court saw that. 'And I really do believe that will be a unifying factor.' The Supreme Court ruled Monday that Donald Trump can stay on the ballot in a fatal blow for the states trying to kick him off and just 24 hours before 15 states vote on Super Tuesday Trump referenced killing two enemies of the US in defense of his claim for immunity - Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, ISIS leader (left), and General Qassem Soleimani of the Iranian Quds Force Two and a half hours earlier, the US Supreme Court unanimously restored the former president to primary ballots, rejecting state attempts to hold the Republican former president accountable for the Capitol riot. It is the latest in a string of court victories for the former president.  Last week, justices said they would also take up a case looking at whether Trump can be criminally prosecuted for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. On Monday, Trump said that removing immunity would leave him liable to prosecution for other things, such as his attacks on the ISIS terrorist group. 'I took out ISIS and I took out some very big people from the standpoint of a different part of the world ... two of the leading terrorists ... probably the two leading terrorists ever that we've ever seen in this world,' he said. 'And those are big decisions. I don't want to be prosecuted for it.' In 2019, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder and leader of ISIS, was killed in a raid by U.S. forces. A year late Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian major general, was killed by an American drone strike in Iraq.  (Osama bin Laden, who ordered the deadliest terror attacks on U.S. soil in history was killed under President Barack Obama in 2011.) Trump said no president would be able to act with a 'free and clear mind' if the threat of prosecution was hanging over them.  Trump addressed the cameras at Mar-a-Lago on Monday hours after the ruling Supporters of Donald Trump clash with police at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 Anti-Trump demonstrators protest outside the US Supreme Court before the court decided whether former US Pres...",0

Reviewing the Top 5 Best Beet Supplements Everyone Should Consider,2024-03-04T18:02:24+00:00,https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2024/03/04/reviewing-the-top-5-best-beet-supplements-everyone-should-consider/,"e-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters e-Edition Sponsored Content Beet supplements offer a range of powerful health benefits, from boosting the immune system, increasing workout performance, and improving cardiovascular health. The key benefits of beets are lower blood pressure, better blood circulation, and higher heart energy levels. Significantly, beetroot extract can increase nitric oxide production, a critical factor in reducing high blood pressure. The best option is to use a beetroot supplement for the highest potency and maximum effect. Pure beetroot powders can be added to liquids, or you can use a high-concentration beetroot extract packed into a capsule or tablet. Suppose you want to see results in blood pressure, heart health, immune system, and athletic performance. In that case, you want to choose a beet supplement that combines the power of beetroot with other natural ingredients that enhance and amplify its benefits. Our top beet supplement recommendation is HeartBeets, which does just that – it combines a highly potent beetroot extract with a whole host of beneficial natural ingredients. Eating enough raw beets to get all the benefits of these hearty vegetables would be a challenge. Thankfully, beetroot supplementation is possible with premium-quality beetroot extracts that offer a high concentration of the best beet bits. Here’s a quick overview of why these stand out as the best beet supplements currently available:  HeartBeets is by far the most comprehensive beet supplement available. It uses 500mg of a potent 4:1 beetroot extract, equal to 2g per serving. It combines this with 12 other natural ingredients, all carefully selected to lower blood pressure, increase nitric oxide production, boost heart energy levels, enhance athletic performance, and bolster the immune system. Leaps and bounds are ahead of other supplements for lowering blood pressure. HeartBeets is the best choice for improving vasodilation, blood circulation, and blood flow and reducing the risk of cardiovascular illness. Along with the beets, HeartBeets includes a substantial dose of folate and an optimal dose of olive leaf, both of which have been shown to relax blood vessels and improve blood flow in multiple clinical trials. HeartBeets is also a great anti-inflammatory and antioxidant supplement, as it combines the anti-inflammatory properties of beets with garlic powder and ginger extract, along with the antioxidant-rich green tea extract and hibiscus extract. Although a little more expensive than other beet supplements, if you want something that does the job, we can’t recommend anything better than HeartBeets.  Like HeartBeets, Heart Sheild is one of the few beet supplements that contain additional ingredients that support the beneficial effects of beetroot. It can contribute to lowering diastolic blood pressure, enhance exercise performance, increase nitric oxide levels, and help you live a healthy lifestyle. If we’re b...",0

     Fox News' Brooke Singman provides details on former President Donald Trump's reaction to the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Colorado's ballot ban. Former President Trump spoke from Mar-a-Lago just hours after the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in his favor, keeping him on the 2024 primary ballot in Colorado, thanking the high court for its unifying decision and looking ahead to its pending ruling on his presidential immunity appeal.  ""I want to start by thanking the Supreme Court for its unanimous decision today. It was a very important decision, were very well crafted, and I think it will go a long way toward bringing our country together, which our country needs,"" Trump said. ""And they worked long, they worked hard, and frankly, they worked very quickly on something that will be spoken about 100 years from now and 200 years from now. Extremely important.""  Trump also blamed President Biden for his legal challenges, and claimed he is using judges and prosecutors to influence the election.

This condition, characterized by unstable blood glucose levels, often leads to a cascade of health problems such as weight gain, energy depletion, weakened immunity, and more. In response, many people turn to prescription medications like Ozempic, a popular drug used to manage blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients. While Ozempic can be effective, it’s important to be aware of its potential side effects. Interestingly, a major contributing factor to high blood sugar levels is often overlooked: the GLP-1 hormone. GLP-1 plays a crucial role in blood sugar regulation within the body. Targeting this hormone could be key to not only managing blood sugar levels but also addressing related health concerns. Enter GlucoTrim, a potent sugar support supplement that zeroes in on this root cause. Designed to regulate blood glucose levels, GlucoTrim also promises to aid in weight loss and support overall health.

But what if that one trick blows the steam out of you and leaves you gasping for oxygen? That’s pretty much the case with Francis Ngannou. Tyson Fury had his taste, and now Anthony Joshua is next. Surely, the sweet science is a slowly and steadily brewed potion to conquer it all. But what if you were to judge on one ingredient—punching power? Does ‘AJ’ stand a chance then? The heavyweights hit hard, but ‘The Predator’ hits harder. Ngannou’s power has grabbed eyeballs since he blew up on the combat sports scene, and ‘The Gypsy King’ smelled the canvas because of it. So where does he rank when compared with the likes of Fury, Deontay Wilder, and especially his next opponent, Joshua?

(Photo by Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images) The 37-year-old fighter’s punch roughly matches a family wagon’s horsepower, if numbers are decoded for a layman. While not every heavy-hitting boxer has hit the PowerKube, it does put Ngannou in a league of his own. UFC lynchpin Dana White has also heaped praise on his former champion when he equated Ngannou’s staple killing blow to 96 horsepower, which is equal to getting hit by a full-throttled Ford Escort and more powerful than a 12-pound sledgehammer swung full force from overhead.

     Fox News' Brooke Singman provides details on former President Donald Trump's reaction to the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Colorado's ballot ban. EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that the Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling Monday is ""both unifying and inspirational,"" while stressing the importance of the high court’s pending decision in the issue of presidential immunity.  The Supreme Court sided unanimously with the 2024 GOP frontrunner in his challenge to Colorado’s attempt to kick him off the 2024 primary ballot.  The high court ruled in favor of Trump's arguments in the case, which will impact the status of efforts in several other states to remove the likely GOP nominee from their respective ballots.  SUPREME COURT TO HEAR TRUMP BALLOT REMOVAL CASE OUT OF COLORADO The court considered for the first time the meaning and reach of Article 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office again. Challenges have been filed to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot in over 30 states. Former President Trump told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that the Supreme Court’s unanimous ruling Monday is ""both unifying and inspirational."" (Sean Rayford/Getty Images) ""A great win for America. Very, very important!"" Trump told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview Monday morning.  ""Equally important for our country will be the decision that they will soon make on immunity for a president — without which, the presidency would be relegated to nothing more than a ceremonial position, which is far from what the founders intended,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""No president would be able to properly and effectively function without complete and total immunity.""  He added, ""Our country would be put at great risk.""  The Supreme Court sided unanimously with former President Trump in his challenge to Colorado’s attempt to kick him off the 2024 primary ballot.

  “In recent days, along with increasing agricultural yield, the State government is also encouraging the development of post-harvest technologies. There is a chance to double the income of farmers if we provide them tools they need at affordable prices and minimum support price and if they realise that there is a good price for their produce. I wish that those graduating today get active in developing such novel agricultural industries for these purposes,” said Agriculture Minister N. Cheluvarayaswamy, at the 58th convocation ceremony of University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore (UAS – B) on Monday.  As many as 1,244 students received various degrees (undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral) during the convocation ceremony, while 63 students were awarded 53 UAS gold medals and 81 donor’s gold medals, and 22 donor’s gold medal certificates.  Snehashree S., a student of BSc (Honours), Agriculture, at GKVK Bengaluru, secured the highest number (13) of gold medals.   M.C. Rangaswamy, a farmer from Doddamagge village in Hassan district, was awarded an honorary doctorate at the convocation for his his contribution in the field of agriculture, adoption of improved technologies on a large scale and its dissemination to the farming community.

Richard-USA TODAY Sports The NBA had a serious problem until last season. With the rise of data analytics and sports science, load management has become a prevalent practice across the NBA. However, this posed a problem for the NBA, as some of its biggest stars regularly sat out games that were aired on national television. This created a huge conundrum for higher-ups within the NBA, especially with the impending new TV rights deal. The NBA implemented certain rules to deal with load management under the new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). One such rule was the 65-game threshold that players had to abide by to be eligible for postseason awards such as the MVP, ROY, and MIP awards. Furthermore, players won’t even be eligible for the All-NBA accolades. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad This rule change has already cost Joel Embiid the chance to retain his MVP crown. Before the meniscus tear he sustained against the Warriors on 30th January, Embiid was the frontrunner for the MVP award. However, his knee injury threw a spanner in the works, as Embiid crossed the 65-game threshold. Additionally, several other standout players, including Jamal Murray, Donovan Mitchell, and Kristaps Porziņģis, are also at risk of missing out on postseason awards due to this rule, despite their impressive performances throughout the season. Donovan Mitchell is on pace to become ineligible for end-of-season awards. pic.twitter.com/lMWjMq48LD — HoopsHype (@hoopshype) March 4, 2024 ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  Mitchell has averaged 28 points, 6.2 assists, and 5.4 rebounds per game this season. His performances basically make him a lock for the All-NBA accolades. However, he has already missed 13 games, which means that he can only miss four more games. Jamal Murray is another victim of the 65-game rule. He has played an instrumental role in the Nuggets’ recent success. However, he has missed 16 games this season, which leaves him with only one more game that he can miss under the 65-game threshold rule.

Study Provides New Insights Into Deadly Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),2024-03-12T23:02:33+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWdoFuv0j2EJBZONpYks2fGs,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   This Image shows the lung surfactant, a complex composed of fats and proteins generated in the lungs, after being exposed to the lysolipid in water where the bright red spots indicate the lysolipid replacing the lung surfactant in a layer of cells. CREDIT: Zasadzinski Research Group, University of Minnesota Twin Cities By Eurasia Review  Researchers at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities may have discovered a mechanical explanation for instability observed in the lungs in cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), particularly in the aftermath of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19 or pneumonia. The research was recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), a peer reviewed journal of the National Academy of Sciences. Currently, there is no known cure for ARDS, a life-threatening lung injury that allows fluid to leak into the lungs. The researchers in this study say that as many as two thirds of all patients that passed away from COVID-19 had ARDS. There is not a clear reason on why specific people with a severe respiratory illness may develop ARDS, while others may not, but researchers in this study were looking to find that answer. They identified the concentration of a lysolipid—a byproduct of the immune response to viruses and bacteria—that can have a major impact in adults suffering from ARDS. Increased concentration of this chemical eliminates the surfactant, a complex composed of fats and proteins generated in the lungs. The result is uneven lung inflation and, ultimately, respiratory distress in adults. “This study looked into the correlation of the concentration of the lysolipid in the lungs. Once that fluid reached a certain level, it started to cause severe impacts,” said University of Minnesota Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science Professor Joseph Zasadzinski and lead professor on the research.  “Your average everyday person usually won’t need to think about this, but if a virus or infection is bothering your lung surfactant system and you end up in the hospital, then it could become top of mind very quickly,” Zasadzinski added  There are a natural amount of these lysolipids that exist in the human body, and as long as those stay below a specific concentration, the average person can breathe normally. When someone has a bad infection, those lysolipids increase, which can lead to respiratory distress. Once a patient is headed in that direction, there are not many ways of reversing those symptoms.  “This research shows frequency dependence, or how quickly you open and close the lungs. This could help doctors try to tailor the treatment process for each specific patient,” said Clara Ciutara, a 2023 Ph.D. chemical engineering and materials science graduate and first author of the study. Previous research of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) in premature infants found that it could be treated by introducing replacement lung...",0
Study: Cheetahs’ Intermediate Size Explains Their Unrivalled Speed,2024-03-12T23:00:17+00:00,https://www.sci.news/biology/cheetahs-size-speed-12760.html,"The fastest animals are neither large elephants nor tiny ants, but intermediately sized, like cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Why does running speed break with the regular patterns that govern most other aspects of animal anatomy and performance? New research suggests that there is not one limit to maximum running speed, as previously thought, but two: how fast versus by how far, muscles contract; the maximum speed an animal can reach is determined by whichever limit is reached first — and that limit is dictated by an animal’s size. The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). “The key to our model is understanding that maximum running speed is constrained both by how fast muscles contract, as well as by how much they can shorten during a contraction,” said Professor Christofer Clemente, a researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast and the University of Queensland. “Animals about the size of a cheetah exist in a physical sweet spot at around 50 kg, where these two limits coincide. These animals are consequently the fastest, reaching speeds of up to 105 km per hour (65 mph).” The first limit, termed the ‘kinetic energy capacity limit,’ suggests that the muscles of smaller animals are restrained by how quickly they can contract. Because small animals generate large forces relative to their weight, running for a small animal is a bit like trying to accelerate in a low gear when cycling downhill. The second limit, called the ‘work capacity limit,’ suggests that the muscles of larger animals are restrained by how far their muscles can contract. Because large animals are heavier, their muscles produce less force in relation to their weight, and running is more akin to trying to accelerate when cycling up a hill in a high gear. “For large animals like rhinos or elephants, running might feel like lifting an enormous weight, because their muscles are relatively weaker and gravity demands a larger cost,” said Dr. Peter Bishop, a researcher at Harvard University. “As a result of both, animals eventually have to slow down as they get bigger.” To test the accuracy of their model, the authors compared its predictions to data on land animal speed and size collected from more than 400 species, from large mammals, birds and lizards to tiny spiders and insects. The model accurately predicted how maximum running speeds vary with body size for animals that differ by more than 10 orders of magnitude in body mass — from tiny 0.1 milligram mites to six-tonne elephants. Their findings shed light on the physical principles behind how muscles evolved and could inform future designs for robots that match the athleticism of the best animal runners. In addition to explaining how fast animals can run, the new model may also provide critical clues for understanding differences between groups of animals. Large reptiles, such as lizards and crocodiles, are generally smaller and slower than large mammals. “One possible explanation for this may be that limb muscle is a smaller percentage ...",0

Senate Bill to Expand Commercial Access to Mid-Band Spectrum,2024-03-12T20:35:46+00:00,https://executivegov.com/2024/03/senate-bill-to-expand-commercial-access-to-mid-band-spectrum/,"Processing.... Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and John Thune, R-S.D., have introduced new legislation to give commercial wireless users more access to mid-band spectrum. The Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2024 would require the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to identify at least 2,500 megahertz of mid-band spectrum that can be reallocated for commercial use and sharing in the next five years, including at least 1,250 megahertz in the next two years, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation said Monday. The bill would also renew the Federal Communications Commission’s congressional authority to run spectrum auctions and require that at least 1,250 megahertz of spectrum be auctioned for full-power use, including 5G, within six years of the bill’s passing. Under the bill, the FCC would also allocate at least 125 megahertz of additional spectrum for unlicensed services. “To dominate in next-generation wireless technologies, stay ahead of our adversaries, and advance strong economic growth, the U.S. must create a pipeline to expand commercial access to mid-band spectrum,” Cruz said. “The Spectrum Pipeline Act of 2024 meets those goals while promoting both consumer and national security interests,” he added.

Health officer says recently-passed vaccine bill is deeply concerning and weakens immunization protection,2024-03-12T20:34:39+00:00,https://wvmetronews.com/2024/03/12/health-officer-says-recently-passed-vaccine-bill-is-deeply-concerning-and-weakens-immunization-protection/,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Health Officer at the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department, Dr. Steven Eshenaur, says the passage of a bill allowing parents to choose whether they vaccinate their children against infectious diseases is very much a concern.

Eshenaur told MetroNews that he testified against the bill in both the House of Delegates and the state Senate, because, up until this point, West Virginia’s immunization regulations for students have proven to be both safe and effective at keeping those diseases out of schools. “That system, those laws have kept our children safe,” Eshenaur said. “This bill weakens those laws.” Eshenaur said the bill specifically allows for parents of children attending private and parochial schools in the state to sign a “religious exemption” form to prevent their child from getting vaccinations that were once mandatory for all students. In addition, it would remove vaccine requirements for students in virtual public schools. He said this still allows those children deemed exempt from getting immunizations to interact with other children and potentially expose them to such diseases, as well. Eshenaur said this poses a potential risk for the entire population, because, in order to keep herd immunity in place and infectious diseases at bay, a 95% immunization rate across the state must be maintained. He said while that 95% immunization rate can still be maintained when taking into account of those who are legitimately medically-exempt from getting vaccines, this bill creates the risk of decreasing that rate by exempting those who may otherwise safely receive immunizations. “When we drop below that threshold, then we will become like our neighbors in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, etc. that have now had measles outbreaks just this year,” he said. Eshenaur said while it won’t happen immediately, the lower immunization rates this policy change could lead to could even open the door up to a relatively longtime dormant disease in the country– polio. He said West Virginia hasn’t had a case of polio since 1970. Eshenaur said a polio case was, however, reported for the first time in many years in the U.S. in New York back in 2022 from someone who was unimmunized. He said if it could break out there again, it could just as easily spark an outbreak here. “Polio still exists in the world, it has never gone away, but we have been able to keep it from infecting our population, because we’ve had strong immunization programs to prevent polio from infecting our children,” he said. He said as an emergency physician who has been all over the world treating these diseases in first-world countries, he saw the affects of what the lack of...",0

"Worms found in Chornobyl may be immune to nuclear radiation, says study",2024-03-12T20:08:03+00:00,https://globalnews.ca/news/10354073/chernobyl-worms-immune-radiation-resistance-study/,"Instructions: Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first.

A certain kind of worm that researchers gathered around the site of the melted-down Chornobyl nuclear power plant has shown a remarkable resilience to nuclear radiation and seems to be largely unaffected living in the most radioactive place on Earth. A study released last week in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and led by researchers at New York University (NYU), found that microscopic worms known as nematodes have a high capacity to withstand damage to its DNA — a finding that could help inform cancer research. DNA and gene changes (also known as mutations) that affect cell growth are what cause cancer. For instance, smoking cigarettes or being exposed to too much UV radiation from the sun can cause DNA damage that can help cancer form and spread. If these little nematodes can withstand Chornobyl-level radiation, perhaps one day they can be used to understand how to protect DNA against carcinogens. “Chornobyl was a tragedy of incomprehensible scale, but we still don’t have a great grasp on the effects of the disaster on local populations,” said Sophia Tintori, a postdoctoral associate at NYU and the first author of the study, according to a press release from NYU. Plants and animals continue to thrive in the Chornobyl exclusion zone, despite the high level of radiation that still plagues the restricted area around the melted-down facility. Hundreds of dogs inhabit the zone, though research has found that they appear physically and genetically different than their counterparts elsewhere. Tintori and her colleagues set out to do similar research. But instead of sequencing the genomes of dogs, they investigated a species of nematodes called Oscheius tipulae.  “These worms live everywhere, and they live quickly, so they go through dozens of generations of evolution while a typical vertebrate is still putting on its shoes,” said Matthew Rockman, a professor of biology at NYU and the study’s senior author. The team collected 15 O. tipulae worms around the exclusion zone, measuring the level of radiation in the locations where they were found using a Geiger counter. The worms came from locations that had low levels of radiation, on par with New York City, and high levels, on par with outer space. They then sequenced the genomes of the 15 Chornobyl worms and compared to them to five nematodes that came from other parts of the world. The researchers were surprised when they learned that they couldn’t identify a signature of radiation damage in the genomes of the Chornobyl worms. “This doesn’t mean that Chornobyl is safe — it more likely means that nematodes are really resilient animals and can withstand extreme conditions,” noted Tintori. “We also don’t know how long each of the worms we collected was in the zone, so we can’t be sure exac...",0

The study, which uses the Fitbit data of more than 2,500 training physicians (interns) across two years, found that the interns’ self-reported mood cycles hit their lowest point nearing 5 a.m. and highest point around 5 p.m. Lack of sleep made these mood swings more intense, leading to worse moods and bigger changes in mood throughout the day. “Mood naturally cycles with lowest point in the morning and highest in the evening independent of sleep deprivation. Sleep deprivation is a separate process that further decreases mood,” said Benjamin Shapiro, lead author of the study and psychiatrist at Dartmouth Health. “So someone awake all night at 5 a.m. should have an even lower mood than if they just woke up at 5 a.m. However, on a typical day their mood at 5 a.m. will still be lower than that in the evening.” The study, published in the journal PLOS Digital Health, analyzed data from 2,602 medical interns over a two-year period. The researchers measured the interns’ continuous heart rate, step count, sleep data and daily mood scores. The researchers also estimated circadian time and time awake from minute-by-minute wearable heart rate and motion measurements. “We discovered that mood follows a rhythm connected to the body’s internal clock, and the clock’s influence increases as someone stays awake longer,” said Danny Forger, senior author of the study and a professor of mathematics and of computational medicine and bioinformatics at the U-M Medical School. “The study highlights the significant role our body’s clock plays in mood and introduces wearable technology as an exciting new way to explore these factors in mental health issues.” The medical interns, part of the Intern Health Study, a multicenter study across the United States involving first-year physicians, also completed a once daily assessment. The interns could complete the assessment at any point in the day, and the assessment consisted of a single question: How was your mood today? The researchers then plotted the participants’ mood scores against their circadian phase and against their time awake. They found that mood peaked at 5 p.m. and dipped to its lowest at 5 a.m. They also found that mood deteriorated the longer the participants were awake. “The field of psychiatry has known that sleep and circadian rhythm play an important role in mental health. However, these findings have only been shown in small samples and in artificial laboratory settings,” Shapiro said. “This study generalizes these findings to everyday life across a large number of participants.” The researchers say their study only looked at a generalized model of mood in medical interns, and that individual variat...",0

Newswise — WASHINGTON, March 12, 2024 – Sometimes, seeing clearly requires complete black. For astronomy and precision optics, coating devices in black paint can cut down on stray light, enhancing images and boosting performance. For the most advanced telescopes and optical systems, every little bit matters, so their manufacturers seek out the blackest blacks to coat them.In the Journal of Vacuum Science & Technology A, by AIP Publishing, researchers from the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology and the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed an ultrablack thin-film coating for aerospace-grade magnesium alloys. Their coating absorbs 99.3% of light while being durable enough to survive in harsh conditions.For telescopes operating in the vacuum of space, or optical equipment in extreme environments, existing coatings are often insufficient.“Existing black coatings like vertically aligned carbon nanotubes or black silicon are limited by fragility,” said author Yunzhen Cao. “It is also difficult for many other coating methods to apply coatings inside a tube or on other complicated structures. This is important for their application in optical devices as they often have significant curvature or intricate shapes.”To solve these problems, the researchers turned to atomic layer deposition (ALD). With this vacuum-based manufacturing technique, the target is placed in a vacuum chamber and sequentially exposed to specific types of gas, which adhere to the object’s surface in thin layers.“One big advantage of the ALD method lies in its excellent step-coverage ability, which means we can obtain uniform film coverage on very complex surfaces, such as cylinders, pillars, and trenches,” said Cao.To make their ultrablack coating, the team used alternating layers of aluminum-doped titanium carbide (TiAlC) and silicon nitride (SiO2). The two materials work together to prevent nearly all light from reflecting off the coated surface.“TiAlC acted as an absorbing layer, and SiO2 was employed to create an anti-reflection structure,” said Cao. “As a result, nearly all of the incident light is trapped in the multilayer film, achieving efficient light absorption.”In tests, the team found an average absorption of 99.3% across a wide range of light wavelengths, from violet light at 400 nanometers all the way to near infrared at 1,000 nanometers.

But such encounters may actually make you feel happier, research has suggested.  It is one of eight simple 'happiness hacks' devised by scientists at the University of Bristol. Writing gratitude letters, conducting acts of kindness and trying out meditation are among other key measures found to improve mental wellbeing.  The four other checkpoints relate to getting sufficient sleep, exercising, savouring experiences and drawing attention to positive parts of the day, for instance writing down 'three good things' that happened.  Students at the University of Bristol who were taught the 'happiness hacks' as part of a 10-week course were found to have a better mental wellbeing two years later. But that was only if they kept using the hacks People will only experience the lasting benefits of happiness if they keep practising the habits, however, the researchers said.  Students who were taught the hacks as part of a 10-week course were found to have a better mental wellbeing two years later. But that was only if they kept using the hacks.  Study co-author Dr Sarah Jelbert, lecturer in psychological science, told MailOnline: 'The intention was that by the end of the course students have a well-rounded understanding of various factors that can contribute towards their own well-being — rather than a to-do' list of activities. 'What we found was that as long as students continued to practice something from the course their elevated wellbeing was maintained. 'But we didn’t need to be prescriptive about exactly what to do and when.'  While seven or more hours of sleep 'is definitely something we recommend', she added that 'any individual student might need seven, eight or nine hours in order to feel well rested'.  They found others continued to write their 'three good things' well beyond the end of the course.  Some, instead, returned to the activity 'every now and again', for instance when they were going through 'a period of stress'.  Launched in 2018, the University of Bristol’s 'Science of Happiness' course was the first of its kind in the UK.  It is open to all undergraduates who have room in their schedule and involves no exams or coursework. Participants must attend lectures and workshops. Students are also taught that social media is not bad for everyone, but can be bad for those who focus on their reputation. Sleep deprivation also impacts on how well we are liked by others, while walking in nature deactivates part of the brain related to negative ruminations, which are associated with depression. The researchers analysed feedback from 228 course graduates in the 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 academic years.  They found students who took the course reported a 10 to 15 per cent improvement in wellbeing.

                A team of graduate students mentored by the Office of the Secretary of Defense’s Manufacturing Science and Technology Program (MSTP) has received first prize in the Indiana University Kelley School of Business’s Field Consulting Project course.

Indiana University created the field consulting project course in 2017 to provide graduate students real-world consulting experience using research-based strategies, which in turn benefit participating organizations and businesses by improving their business models. The course pairs four-person teams of second-year master’s degree students with local businesses, government agencies, and non-profits to solve business challenges. Throughout the semester, the teams spend many hours learning, researching, and collaborating with clients to address specific needs or challenges within their industries. This hands-on experience helps students take what they’ve learned in the classroom and apply it in practical ways, developing their professional skills in the process. The challenge culminates at the end of the semester with an award dinner where members of one team are recognized as the Jim Grandorf Field Consulting Project Champions. 

MSTP has participated in the challenge since its inception through an educational partnership agreement between the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane Division, and Indiana University. At the beginning of each academic year, MSTP leadership identifies areas of improvement within MSTP’s organizational structure, strategy, or operational flow. This year’s graduate team was tasked with improving the process flow and efficiencies for the MSTP annual proposal call. To aid in devising solutions, the students conducted interviews with the MSTP team to understand the current proposal process and evaluate where bottlenecks and challenges occur. 

Expanding on the winning efforts to develop the initial process model by MSTP’s 2017 Indiana University student partners (insert link to 2017 news story), the 2023 team generated a flow chart of the MSTP proposal cycle and built a digital tracking tool that uses metrics to capture the movement of a proposal submission through every step of the process. These rapid insights delivered by the new capability enable MSTP to quickly track progress, coordinate more effectively, and make efficient decisions. The tool also provides peace of mind and transparency to submitters, who can now observe the progress of their proposal in real time.

"Analysis: Despite political rhetoric, most Americans have faith in science",2024-03-12T14:28:34+00:00,https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2024/03/12/confidence-in-science-survey/4461710250795/,"


The Trump administration's attacks on scientists didn't shake Americans' confidence in science, a new analysis shows.
""The proportion of Americans with a low level of trust in scientific expertise rose from 3% in 2016 to 13% in 2020,"" said lead author Jon Miller, a research scientist emeritus at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

""But that increase was more than matched by a rise in the proportion of Americans with a high level of trust in scientific expertise, from 23% to 58%.""
Former President Donald Trump's attacks on medical experts -- especially Dr. Anthony Fauci, former director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- fueled polarization during the pandemic but made the question of scientific expertise more important to many Americans, the researchers noted.

While critics condemned the administration's views and actions on such topics as climate change, environmental protection and the COVID-19 pandemic, even conservative Republicans' trust in science rose more than distrust between 2016 and 2020, researchers found.
Their study -- published recently in the journal Science and Public Policy -- evaluated changes between 2016 and 2020 alongside a series of national public opinion surveys that began in 1957.

The surveys show that Americans have been highly appreciative of the benefits of science and technology and have had little fear about the dangers.
In 2016, interest in science and technology, college-level study of these subjects and education level were the strongest predictors of appreciation for the benefits of science and technology. Fundamentalist religious beliefs were the strongest predictor of apprehension about the dangers.
The trends were similar in 2020.
But their findings suggested that a basic level of scientific understanding enabled Americans who had been uninterested in science and tech to come up to speed on current events, especially the pandemic, researchers said.
""The Trump administration's contempt for scientific and technological expertise was rightly a cause for concern, but our study shows that the American public was by and large unaffected,"" Miller said in a university news release.
""But it will be necessary to continue to improve the public's understanding of science and technology to ensure that it is equipped to weather any further storms.""

Former 4Ps monitored child garners 2nd top spot in Criminologist Licensure Exam,2024-03-12T12:51:09+00:00,https://journal.com.ph/former-4ps-monitored-child-garners-2nd-top-spot-in-criminologist-licensure-exam/,"The Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has produced another topnotcher in the person of Angeline Ilagan from Imus, Cavite. Angeline, a former monitored child of the DSWD-4Ps, secured the 2nd top spot in the February 2024 Criminologist Licensure Examination (CLE). She finished her Bachelor of Science in Criminology from the Cavite State University. “We are proud of Angeline and we congratulate her for this achievement. She is the latest addition to the list of former 4Ps monitored children who have topped various board examinations,” DSWD Asst. Secretary for Strategic Communications Romel Lopez, who is also agency spokesperson, said on Tuesday (March 12). As of the latest count by the 4Ps National Program Management Office under Director Gemma Gabuya, the government’s anti-poverty flagship program has already produced 41 topnotchers in different fields across the country. Since 2016 up to the present, the 4Ps now has 32,000 college graduates. Of this number, 82 graduated Magna Cum Laude, 1,135 Cum Laude, and 132 finished their collegiate course with Special Distinctions. Angeline, together with her twin sister, Angelica, has been a 4Ps monitored child since Grade 5. She said that 4Ps has helped her and twin sister, Angelica, meet their school needs until their senior year. “Lahat po ng pagsisikap at pagod ko sa pag-aaral ay para po sa aking pamilya,” Angeline said. (All my perseverance and sacrifices to study are for my family.) Aside from Angeline, 28 other 4Ps monitored children from various regions passed the CLE. One of them is Precious Anne Aguyen who graduated Cum Laude from the F.L. Vargas College, Inc. in Abulug Campus, Cagayan province. The board passers are now part of the 4Ps roster of board examination passers numbering to 4,142, as of March. “We also extend our congratulations to these board passers,” Asst. Sec. Lopez said. Asst. Sec. Lopez said the achievement of these former monitored children of 4Ps is a testament that the program is on track of its objective to break the inter-generational cycle of poverty through education. “Ang tagumpay na nakamit ng mga batang ito ay isang patunay na ang 4Ps, lalo na ang aspeto ng programa na investment sa edukasyon ay nakatutulong sa ating mahihirap na kababayan upang mapataas ang antas ng kanilang pamumuhay,” the spokesperson said. (The success achieved by these children is proof that the 4Ps, especially the aspect of the program that invests in education, contributes to improving the quality of life of our poor and marginalized countrymen.) 4Ps is the flagship program of the national government on poverty reduction and social development implemented by the DSWD. It provides cash grants to extremely poor households to improve their health, nutrition, and education, particularly for children aged 0-18. To date, the program has 4.4 million household-beneficiaries nationwide.",0

NHL still won’t change CTE stance after Chris Simon’s suicide,2024-03-20T22:34:24+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/20/sports/nhl-still-wont-change-cte-stance-after-chris-simons-suicide/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 The NHL doesn’t appear to be changing its position on the link between chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and repeated hits to the head. Deputy commissioner Bill Daly told NHL insider Frank Seravalli that the NHL hadn’t changed its view on the degenerative brain disease and that the “science is still lacking.” This comes amid a renewed spotlight on the issue in the wake of former NHL enforcer Chris Simon’s suicide this week at the age of 52.  The former Islanders and Rangers forward’s family said in a statement via his former agent that the “family strongly believes and witnessed firsthand, that Chris struggled immensely from CTE which unfortunately resulted in his death.” CTE is only diagnosable after death, and his family’s claims won’t be able to be firmly proven unless his brain is donated and examined by scientific researchers.  NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the league has made “progress” to make hockey safer for players. “Chris’ passing is tragic, it’s sad,” Bettman said in Florida on Wednesday, according to Seravalli. “We extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. And, you know, on all of these matters, we wait to see what the medical experts tell us. “Having said that, I think it’s well documented with all of the progress that we’ve made over the last couple [of] decades to make the game as safe as possible.” Simon previously told an Ottawa court in 2017 when he filed for bankruptcy that he was unable to work due to injuries sustained during his hockey career.  The former NHL tough guy had said in court filings that he had CTE symptoms that are “thought to be attributable to significant brain trauma during his hockey career,” the National Post reported at the time.  Simon said he had also been dealing with depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, which are symptoms linked to CTE.  The United States National Institutes of Health concluded in 2022 that repetitive traumatic brain injuries caused CTE.  The following year, a study conducted by Columbia University — examining more than 6,000 NHL players from 1967-2022 — found that players who had 50 or more fights in their career “died a decade earlier on average compared to their less pugilistic peers.”  It also found that “enforcers” — players who racked up 50 or more fights while playing in the NHL — were “more likely to die of suicide and drug overdose, common occurrences in people with CTE.” Simon fought more than 100 times during his NHL career.  Fighting has again been in the spotlight — especially in New York — as the Rangers’ Matt Rempe has engaged in a slew of scraps early in his NHL career.

The PMT is part of a joint effort between the Commerce Department and Intel to invest a total of over $100 billion into the U.S. microelectronics industry. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said the deal is “one of the largest investments ever in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing.” She noted that it will create over 30,000 jobs.  The investment gives Intel the choice to utilize up to $11 billion in federal loans. The company also expects to claim the Department of the Treasury’s Investment Tax Credit, which could potentially reach 25 percent of qualified investments of over $100 billion in a five-year period. Through the agreement, Intel aims to promote U.S. technology leadership and improve its Intel Foundry and finance R&D initiatives focused on microelectronics. The organization will also work to cultivate the future semiconductor workforce while increasing supply chain resilience and sustainability. This announcement follows a recent move in which the Department of Defense canceled its plan to provide $2.5 billion in CHIPS and Science Act funding to Intel, pushing the responsibility to the Commerce Department.

Why did geologists reject the “Anthropocene” epoch? It’s not rock science.,2024-03-20T20:04:07+00:00,https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/7/24092675/anthropocene-climate-change-epoch-geology,"Filed under: The battle proves that time is political, any way you cut it. 
    Finding the best ways to do good. 
   Scientists have dealt the final blow in a long-running fight over one big question: Have humans messed up the Earth so badly that we’re now living in a new climate epoch? For 15 years, an intrepid band of geologists has been trying to argue exactly that. They claimed that humanity has ushered in the Anthropocene, a new chapter in the Earth’s history borne of our impact on the planet. And they hunted all around the globe for proof. But it’s not easy to make the case that we’re in a new epoch. That’s a technical term that describes a chunk of time typically lasting a few million years (sounds like a lot, but it’s nothing compared to a geological “period” like the 54-million-year Jurassic or “era” like the 186-million-year Mesozoic). Scientists have to vote on whether the term “epoch” applies.  In February, a top body of Earth’s professional timekeepers voted — against canonizing the Anthropocene. That vote was immediately contested, with some members arguing that the decision was premature and more time was needed to weigh all the evidence. But this week, an overseeing body called the International Union of Geological Sciences decided to uphold the vote, making it official. And while this might just seem like a smackdown over semantics, the fight over “Anthropocene” is much more. It’s a deeply political fight over how to make meaning of what we humans are doing to the planet. Earth has gone through distinct geological epochs, chunks of time defined by changes in rock layers. To prove that the Anthropocene represents a new chunk, a group of geologists had to find a “golden spike” — a physical site where the rock, sediment, or ice clearly records the change from a previous chapter in time to a new one.  In 2009, they started scouring the planet and found a range of strong candidates, from a peat bog in Poland to a coral reef in Australia to the ice of Antarctica. Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went wrong. Please enter a valid email and try again. But the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG), as the group was called, wanted to pick a site where the rock record indisputably shows that we’ve left behind the Holocene epoch, which started 11,700 years ago when the last ice age ended. In 2023, the geologists said they’d found their holy grail: little Crawford Lake in Ontario, Canada. There, the waters are so deep that whatever sinks to the floor usually remains without mixing with the upper layers of water, so it stays preserved, offering an amazingly good record of geological change. Since the middle of the 20th century, the sediment there has been inundated by the byproducts of human activity: plutonium isotopes from the nuclear bombs we’ve detonated, ash from the fossil fuels we’ve burned, and nitrogen from the fertilizer we’ve use...",0

BYU’s Aly Khalifa heads into March Madness without food or water while observing Ramadan,2024-03-20T19:17:02+00:00,https://www.mymotherlode.com/sports/college-sports-general-news/3327017/byus-aly-khalifa-heads-into-march-madness-without-food-or-water-while-observing-ramadan.html,"

                                                 BYU’s Aly Khalifa heads into March Madness without food or water while observing Ramadan                                                  OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Aly Khalifa will set his alarm for 4:30 a.m. Thursday, a witching hour for a college kid if ever there was one, and roll out of bed for the same breakfast as always: scrambled eggs, yogurt, some fruit, all washed down with a whole lot of water. It will be the last he eats or drinks for nearly 16 hours. Then he will pray, prostrating in accordance with Ramadan, the holiest month for Muslims, not for leading BYU to victory in its game hours later against Duquesne but out of a profound sense of reverential devotion. It is a fast Khalifa is embarking on willingly, yet one that carries with it unusual challenges during the NCAA Tournament. The energy the 6-foot-11 forward from Alexandria, Egypt, will expend on the court over 40 minutes cannot be replenished until much later in the day, after the sun mercifully drops over the horizon and darkness finally sets in. “Not going to lie,” Khalifa said in a corner of the Cougars’ locker room Wednesday, having just stepped off the bus for practice at about the same time as tipoff will occur the following morning, “I’m real thirsty right now. That’s the hardest part.” One of the Five Pillars of Islam is the “sawm,” where during the ninth month of the Islamic calendar healthy adults are required to abstain from food and drink during daylight hours. The practice is intended to renew their awareness and gratitude for all that God has bestowed upon them, and to serve as a reminder of their religious obligation to help those less fortunate. There are exceptions for children and the elderly, women who are pregnant and those who are traveling, and that could have given Khalifa a reprieve. In fact, BYU teammates Fousseyni Traore, a native of Mali, and Atiki Ally Atiki, who was recruited to the predominantly Mormon school from Tanzania, chose to observe Ramadan in other ways, such as extended prayer. Yet Khalifa wanted to fast in earnest, putting faith in God — and the BYU training staff — he could endure such deprivation. Cougars coach Mark Pope has provided leadership and guidance. Michael Davie, the school’s director of sports science, has been meticulously monitoring his weight and hydration level. Robert Ramos, the director of sports medicine, is providing solidarity — “He’s doing it with me,” Khalifa said with a smile. “Rob was like, ‘I got you.’” They had a dry run last week during the Big 12 Tournament, where the Cougars won a second-round game against UCF before losing in the quarterfinals to Texas Tech. (Khalifa tweaked his ankle against the Red Raiders but is ready to go this week.) “We’re getting more comfortable with the schedule, more comfortable with the diet, more comfortable with the ...",0

The odyssey to immunize Somalia’s most remote populations,2024-03-20T19:16:01+00:00,https://www.laprensalatina.com/the-odyssey-to-immunize-somalias-most-remote-populations/,"By Lucía Blanco Gracia Dollow, Somalia, Mar 20 (EFE).- If people can’t get to the vaccines, bring the vaccines closer to the people: that is the maxim that nurse Ahmed Garad and his colleagues follow in their daily work to immunize all Somalis – even those in the most remote parts of the country or those controlled by Islamist militants. “We start the day by collecting vaccines from the hospital in a small refrigerator. Then we pack what we need for that day or for the whole week and get into the cars,” Garad tells EFE from the Kaharey displacement camp, on the outskirts of the town of Dollow, in southwestern Somalia. Dressed in a white coat, the 32-year-old Garad sits on a plastic chair next to the flimsy-looking house that has been converted into the camp hospital. The roof and silvery corrugated-iron walls gleam as around 20 women inside shelter from the sun, their babies wrapped in different colored sarongs, waiting for the medical team to examine them, weigh them and, if necessary, vaccinate them. There are usually few surprises: they will most likely have to receive the injection. Somalia is one of the 20 countries in the world where most children have never been immunized or have not been fully immunized. In fact, it is estimated that only 30-40% of children are fully covered against tuberculosis, polio, whooping cough, diphtheria, tetanus and measles. NO INFRASTRUCTURE, DISPLACEMENT “We have a country whose health system has been decimated by decades of conflict. In many areas there are no medical centers and, if there are, they are not functional, especially in the center and south of the country,” Milhia Abdul Kader, head of Health in Somalia for the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), tells EFE. Only 27% of Somalis can access health services “without significant financial impact”, Kader warns. Especially in rural areas, most cannot afford the high cost of traveling across miles of arid landscape to get to the nearest hospital. The lack of infrastructure is compounded by displacement: forced by violence from the Islamist group Al Shabab or extreme weather events that have devastated crops and livestock in recent years, more than 3.8 million people have fled their homes. But that is not the only movement that hampers vaccine coverage: at least 26% of Somalis are nomadic shepherds and do not have a fixed residence, but move periodically in search of fresh pastures and water. “Sometimes you get to a place where you know that there were people there, but there is no one. They’ve already moved,” laughs Garad, who is used to traveling from one end of the Dollow district to the other with his mobile team. Armed with coolers that can maintain the cold chain for up to a month without electricity, as well as food supplements and other medicines, he and his colleagues have come to work “under a tree,” he says. ISLAMIST BAN It is not only the climate and displacement that make vaccination difficult in Somalia. Al Shabab, which controls much of...",0

                LAKE FOREST, ILLINOIS – In a collaborative effort to promote STEM education and inspire future leaders in science and technology, over 40 volunteers from Recruit Training Command (RTC) Great Lakes lent their expertise to support the eighth annual SeaPerch Regional Competition held on March 16 at Lake Forest Academy. 

Hosted by the National Museum of the American Sailor (NMAS) and Navy League, this event brought together 136 high school students and 60 advisors from 40 schools for a day of underwater robotics challenges.

The SeaPerch program, designed to cultivate students’ interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), offers participants the opportunity to construct and operate an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV). Throughout the project, students gain valuable insights into engineering concepts, problem-solving, teamwork, and technical applications. These skills are vital for shaping the future of the Navy and the broader STEM community.

David Twifford, a retired Navy master chief and former command master chief of RTC who previously coordinated the SeaPerch community outreach program, emphasized the significance of events like these for young students. 

“SeaPerch is a great opportunity for young students to experience STEM,” Twifford remarked. “Partnering with the military, specifically the Navy, provides students with insights into the extensive engineering work integral to naval operations. It’s not just about ships and Sailors; engineering plays a crucial role in every aspect of Navy operations.”

For many of the participating students, the SeaPerch competition offered their first chance to interact with military personnel on a personal level. This interaction not only fosters a deeper understanding of the Navy’s role in ...",0
Intel to Receive $8.5 Billion In CHIPS & Science Act Funds,2024-03-20T18:30:39+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/intel-to-receive-8-5-billion-in-chips-science-act-funds/,"Intel is poised to receive up to $8.5 billion in direct funding from the CHIPS & Science Act, along with an additional $11 billion in loans available to the company. The CHIPS Act is the US’ attempt to revitalize its semiconductor industry and reduce dependence on foreign companies and foundries. The issue became a major point of concern during the pandemic when supply chains were compromised and semiconductor shortages impacted everything from computers to automobiles. The Biden administration pointed to America’s historic role in the semiconductor industry, and how the CHIPS Act would help it recapture some of that glory. Semiconductors were invented in America and power everything from cell phones to electric vehicles, refrigerators, satellites, defense systems, and more. But today, the United States produces less than 10 percent of the world’s chips and none of the most advanced ones. Thanks to President Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act, that is changing. Companies have announced over $240 billion in investments to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States since the President took office. Semiconductor jobs are making a comeback. And thanks to CHIPS investments like the one today, America will produce roughly 20% of the world’s leading-edge chips by the end of the decade. Much like the US semiconductor industry at large, Intel was an early leader in the field before being eclipsed by foreign companies. Intel is desperately trying to retake the crown as the world’s most advanced chip maker and sees US investment as a path toward that goal. The company plans to use the funds to help support its new foundry construction, according to the White House. The announcement will support the construction and expansion of Intel facilities in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico, and Oregon, creating nearly 30,000 jobs and supporting tens of thousands of indirect jobs.

			Trending:		 It wasn’t that long ago that we were wondering when we’d see a good soaking rainstorm. We didn’t and the Marin Municipal Water District said it was perilously close to its mountain reservoirs running out of water and had launched into plans to build an emergency transbay pipeline to import water. Then it rained. It poured. The photo in the IJ from Jan. 12 showed Stafford Lake over its banks and two lakeside hammocks hanging over the water. Though just a year or two removed from months of prolonged drought, IJ Photo Editor Alan Dep’s image is a reminder our water supply relies on the variables of the weather. That’s why Marin water agencies are joining forces with the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes Water Affiliates Group, a group that researches atmospheric rivers and other severe weather patterns. It is affiliated with the University of California, San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The goal is for this information to help manage water supplies and mitigate flood risk. For the Marin water agencies, this is about “being on top of science,” says Tony Williams, North Marin Water’s general manager. Throw climate change into the mix and gaining a handle on long-term weather patterns sounds like promising knowledge that should work to local water agencies’ advantage when it comes to managing our local water supply. In fact, a 2023 report by the Marin County Civil Grand Jury urged local water districts to collaborate with science institutions working on climate change. For North Marin, the group’s research will be useful in the district’s planning for improvements to the Stafford Lake dam. The overall goal of working with the group is to minimize surprises and help water agencies do a better job of preparing for another prolonged drought. It was just in 2021, when MMWD’s leadership was facing the prospect that it could deplete its water supply as soon as mid-2022. Tougher water conservation measures were imposed on local residents and businesses, but the outlook was troubling. Other parts of the state were getting winter storms, but month after month they seemed to bypass the county. Then it rained – and rained, bringing the reservoirs back to capacity. But the close call led MMWD voters to elect three new directors and their promise to do a better job of making the district’s supply more resilient. Conservation will always be part of that strategy. It should. It must be an ethic that we have developed through our drought years, if not before. But the weather group’s research should help us avoid surprises by making extreme weather patterns more predictable in the future. As climate change promises to bring more extremes in our local weather patterns, putting science to work in making them more predictable and enabling us to plan and prepare for them sounds like a smart partnership.

"Vaping causes similar DNA changes as smoking, study finds",2024-03-20T16:46:01+00:00,https://www.laprensalatina.com/vaping-causes-similar-dna-changes-as-smoking-study-finds/,"Science Desk, Mar 20 (EFE).- A recent study has revealed that vaping causes the same DNA changes in human cells as smoking, with these associated with the future development of lung cancer in smokers. The study, published in the Cancer Research journal, analyzed DNA changes in cheek cell samples taken from over 3,500 users of vaping devices or electronic cigarettes, including individuals with limited tobacco smoking history. “We cannot say that e-cigarettes cause cancer based on our study, but we do observe e-cigarette users exhibit some similar epigenetic changes in buccal cells as smokers, and these changes are associated with future lung cancer development in smokers,” said Chiara Herzog, the author of the study from University College London, and University of Innsbruck in Austria. Herzog emphasized the need for further research to determine whether these features could be used to individually predict cancer in smokers and e-cigarette users. Specifically, the study examined the effects of e-cigarettes and tobacco on human cells by studying a type of epigenetic change in samples called DNA methylation. The epigenome refers to an extra layer of information that is superimposed on human genetic material, the DNA. Epigenomes change throughout a person’s life and can be influenced by various factors, both genetic and non-genetic, such as aging, lifestyle, exposure to hormones, chemicals, environmental factors, stress, and psychological trauma. The study found that oral epithelial cells showed substantial epigenomic changes in smokers, which are further elevated in lung cancers or pre-cancers compared to the normal lung tissue, supporting the idea that smoking-associated epigenetic changes allow cells to grow more quickly. Similar epigenomic changes were observed in the cells of e-cigarette users who had smoked fewer than 100 tobacco cigarettes in their lifetime. “While the scientific consensus is that e-cigarettes are safer than smoking tobacco, we cannot assume they are completely safe to use and it is important to explore their potential long-term risks and links to cancer,” Herzog said. The researchers also found that some smoking-related epigenetic changes remain more stable than others after giving up smoking, including such changes in cervical cells. The epigenome reflects how the human body responded to past environmental exposures like smoking and enables scientists to predict future health outcomes and disease, said Martin Widschwendter, another author of the study.

"Intel receiving whopping $20B from Biden to boost US chip output and reduce reliance on China, Taiwan",2024-03-20T16:37:35+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/20/business/intel-receiving-whopping-20b-from-biden-to-boost-us-chip-output/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 The Biden administration on Wednesday said it is awarding Intel nearly $20 billion in grants and loans as part of the CHIPS Act, supercharging the company’s domestic semiconductor output and marking the government’s largest outlay to subsidize leading-edge chip production. President Joe Biden will announce the preliminary agreement for $8.5 billion in grants and up to $11 billion in loans for Intel in Arizona, where some of the funding will be used to build two new factories and modernize an existing one. Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo called it a huge deal and one of the largest investments ever in US semiconductor manufacturing. “It means leading-edge semiconductors made in the United States of America,” she said Tuesday, noting that the administration hopes to increase the United States’ share of leading-edge chip production from 0% to 20% by 2030 through the subsidy program. The historic outlay shows the Biden administration is betting big on Intel as part of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, a bid to boost domestic semiconductor output with $52.7 billion in funding, including $39 billion in subsidies for semiconductor production and $11 billion for research and development. It could also help Biden, who lags rival former Republican President Donald Trump in voter perceptions of the US economy, to again take Arizona in November’s presidential election. The Democrat narrowly won the Southwestern swing state in 2020. The goal of the CHIPS Act is to reduce reliance on China and Taiwan, as the share of global semiconductor manufacturing capacity in the US has fallen from 37% in 1990 to 12% in 2020, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. Lawmakers have warned that US dependence on chips manufactured in Taiwan by the world’s top contract chip manufacturer TSMC is risky because China claims the island as its territory and has reserved the right to use force to retake it. Last month, the Biden administration awarded $1.5 billion to GlobalFoundries, the world’s third-largest contract chipmaker, to build a semiconductor production facility in Malta, NY, and expand existing operations there and in Burlington, Vt. In January, the Commerce Department announced Microchip Technology would get $162 million in government grants, allowing the company to triple production of mature-node semiconductor chips and microcontroller units at two US factories. Awards for South Korea’s Samsung and Taiwan’s TSMC are expected in the coming weeks. The Commerce Department is dedicating $28 billion for government subsidies for advanced chip manufacturing — although it has more than $70 billion in requests — and also has $75 billion in lending authority. Reuters first reported news of Biden’s Arizona trip, which could also help Democrats defend a critical  Senate seat in November and possibly provide a boost in a pair of competitive House of Representatives races. Arizona was a point of pri...",0

                Editors note: Clara Gourley is a history and political science major at Robert Morris University and a practicum student attached to the 911th Airlift Wing's History Office. All findings and content are attributed to Gourley's research of historical records and newspaper clippings belonging to the 911th Airlift Wing. -Master Sgt. Jeffrey  Grossi

Women have played indispensable roles in bolstering the U.S. military since the days of the Revolutionary War. Betsy Ross, a legendary figure in American history, is known for her role in creating the first American flag. Sybil Ludington, often referred to as the ""female Paul Revere,"" bravely rode through the night to warn American troops of a British attack in 1777. Deborah Sampson disguised herself as a man and enlisted in the Continental Army, participating in skirmishes and battles for more than a year before her true identity was discovered. Their contributions, however, were long overshadowed by government restrictions that barred them from serving as permanent, full-time members until relatively recently.

One Robert Morris University history major lent her research skills to Pittsburgh International Airport Air Reserve Station to piece together the threads of history that stitched the wing’s legacy. At the onset of Women’s History month, Clara Gourley, the practicum student attached to the 911th Airlift Wing’s History Office, focused her aim on the women who paved their way in military service. 

Amidst the tumult of World War II, with Europe engulfed in conflict, the United States confronted a pressing dilemma – a scarcity of qualified male pilots for crucial combat missions, said Gourley. It was during this pivotal period that pilot Jaquelin Cochran approached First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt with a visionary proposal – to enlist female pilots for non-combat roles, freeing up their male counterparts for frontline duty.

Eight years later, the establishment of the Air Force in 1947 heralded a new era, culminating in the historic signing of the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act by President Truman on June 12, 1948. This landmark legislation granted women the opportunity to serve as permanent, regular members of the armed forces, paving t...",0

Two-year-old Émile Soleil was staying at the isolated Alpine home of Philippe Vedovini, 58, when the child went missing in July last year. In a mysterious case that has drawn comparisons with hit BBC drama The Missing, starring James Nesbitt and Frances O'Connor, in which a young boy vanishes while on holiday with his family in France, there has been no trace of him since. Investigators are refusing to rule out any theory for the tragedy, including abduction and murder. Émile was officially in the care of Mr Vedovini on the day of his disappearance, as his parents took a break. A witness saw Mr Vedovini, a physiotherapist-osteopath, cutting wood outside his house around the time Émile is thought to have wandered off from the property in Haut-Vernet, a hamlet south of Grenoble. Two-year-old Émile Soleil (pictured) was staying at the isolated Alpine home of Philippe Vedovini, 58, when he went missing Investigators are refusing to rule out any theory for the tragedy, including abduction and murder Gendarmes meticulously search the outskirts of the village of Vernet On Wednesday, multiple French news outlets including Le Parisien and the highly respected investigative newspaper Le Canard enchaîné [The Chained Duck] reported disturbing new information about Mr Vedovini. ‘It is above all his past that raises questions,’ writes Le Parisien, as it outlined details of a sex abuse scandal at a Roman Catholic school in the 1990s. It also confirmed that Mr Vedovini – who denies any wrongdoing and was not charged with any offence following the child abuse investigation – ‘has attracted the attention of gendarmes and constitutes one of their many lines of enquiry.’ Mr Vedovini was training to be a monk when he worked at Riaumont, a Catholic community that includes a boarding school for troubled youngsters in Northern France. Situated at Liévin, in the Pas-de-Calais, it was run by Benedictine monks who received multiple complaints from former pupils between 2014 and 2017. They said they had suffered sexual abuse, including rape, in the early 1990s, as well as regular physical beatings. Mr Vedovini, who was known as Brother Philippe when he worked at the school between 1991 and 1994, was implicated in the enquiry as an ‘assisted witness’. Interviewed by police in April 2018, he admitted to administering ‘somewhat harsh’ physical discipline, but said he had never broken the law, according to a source close to the enquiry.

"Vaccine Protects Cattle From Bovine Tuberculosis, May Eliminate Disease",2024-03-28T23:21:16+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeUgj8qnZ8jGTHgrmwRGUK6,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   Researchers have demonstrated that a vaccine for tuberculosis currently used in humans significantly reduces infectiousness of vaccinated livestock, improving prospects for elimination and control. CREDIT: Vivek Kapur, Penn State By Eurasia Review   Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is a livestock disease that results in large economic losses to animal agriculture worldwide. The disease can also transmit to humans and cause severe illness and death. Researchers from Penn State, Addis Ababa University and the University of Cambridge have now demonstrated that a vaccine for TB currently used in humans significantly reduces infectiousness of vaccinated livestock, improving prospects for elimination and control. The study published in the journal Science.  The spillover of infection from livestock has been estimated to account for about 10% of human tuberculosis cases. While such zoonotic TB (zTB) infections are most commonly associated with gastrointestinal infections related to drinking contaminated milk, zTB can also cause chronic lung infections in humans. Lung disease caused by zTB can be indistinguishable from regular tuberculosis but is more difficult to treat due to natural antibiotic resistance in the cattle bacteria.  “For over a hundred years, programs to eliminate bovine tuberculosis have relied on intensive testing and slaughtering of infected animals,” said Vivek Kapur, professor of microbiology and infectious diseases and Huck Distinguished Chair in Global Health at Penn State and a corresponding author of the study. “This approach is unimplementable in many parts of the world for economic and social reasons, resulting in considerable animal suffering and economic losses from lost productivity, alongside an increased risk of spillover of infection to humans. By vaccinating cattle, we hope to be able to protect both cattle and humans from the consequences of this devastating disease.”  In the study, carried out in Ethiopia, the researchers examined the ability of the vaccine, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), to directly protect cattle that receive it, as well as to indirectly protect both vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle by reducing transmission. They placed vaccinated and unvaccinated animals into enclosures with naturally infected animals in a novel crossover design performed over two years.   “Our study found that BCG vaccination reduces TB transmission in cattle by almost 90%,” said Andrew Conlan, associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Cambridge and a corresponding author of the study. “Vaccinated cows also developed significantly fewer visible signs of TB than unvaccinated ones. This suggests that the vaccine not only reduces the progression of the disease, but that if vaccinated animals become infected, they are also substantially less infectious to others.”  Next, using livestock census and movement data from Ethiopia, the team developed a transmission model to explore the potential for...",0
A Perfect Storm: Assessing Deadly Impact Of Climate-Driven Flooding And Cyber Attacks,2024-03-28T23:15:06+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeLtT39VJDs_FRpWVnEcNkS,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   By Eurasia Review  Society is now in an era in which climate change and cyber insecurity are regular threats to life and property. In tandem, the two have the potential to be especially deadly. “There’s evidence that climate change increases the risk of flooding, and the losses due to those floods are growing every year,” says Y.C. Ethan Yang, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering (CEE) in Lehigh University’s P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science. “Scientists have started thinking about compound issues that further exacerbate flooding, like when a hurricane is followed by heavy rainfall.”  Yang and his team, which included Chung-Yi Lin ’23 PhD (now a postdoc at Virginia Tech) and fellow Lehigh CEE faculty member Farrah Moazeni, were interested in studying that one-two punch, and particularly, “what happens when a natural disaster and a man-made disaster happen simultaneously.”  In their case, the man-made disaster was a cyber attack. The result of their study, “Flood Risks of Cyber-Physical Attacks in a Smart Storm Water System,” was recently published in Water Resources Research. The researchers wanted to understand how vulnerable a smart stormwater system could be to a cyber attack when that same system was simultaneously dealing with storm-induced flooding. “The idea of the smart city is great, but it opens the door to hackers,” says Yang. “We wanted to know in what flooding scenario a hacker could cause the most harm.” Yang and his team used historical data from the stormwater management system in Bethlehem Township, Pennsylvania, to build a hydrological model to simulate flooding. They also developed an attack model that mimicked how a hacker might interfere with the system, for instance, by opening or closing gates that control water levels in retention ponds.  They combined the data with the models to run simulations under various climate change impact scenarios (e.g., the impact of increasingly higher average global temperatures) to evaluate the conditions in which a hacker might have the greatest impact on a stormwater system, thereby increasing a community’s flood risk. “We found that if a flooding event is big enough, say there’s a Category 5 hurricane, a hacker isn’t going to increase the risk, because the system is going to flood anyway,” says Yang. “The most vulnerable condition, however, is during low- to mid-level flooding events. The system should be able to handle those events. But if someone intentionally opens a gate at the wrong time, it will overwhelm the system and cause a flood downstream. We were able to quantify and show through visualizations this additional flooding risk caused by a cyber attack.” The results have already prompted two additional projects: One will explore how to prevent such interference, and the second will examine the cascading effects within a flooded community, specifically how different groups of people are affected. “We kn...",0
Syracuse emerges as thriving innovation hub,2024-03-28T22:00:00+00:00,https://www.newsreports.com/syracuse-emerges-as-thriving-innovation-hub/,"A descriptive review on Mar.  22, 2024, identified Syracuse as a top hub for innovative ecosystems featuring prosperous startups and burgeoning tech and life sciences firms. This advantageous location offers excellent connections through road, rail, or air, making it easy to access to major markets. Syracuse is home to flourishing sectors such as gaming, cybersecurity, AI, and 3D printing which incubate innovation and attract investments. The region also boasts a high density of talented professionals, many of whom are graduates from local universities specializing in fields such as coding and data analytics. Various startup incubators and accelerators have been established in Syracuse, supplying young companies with the needed backing to expand and scale. Government support via tax incentives, grants, and funding enhances Syracuse’s business appeal. However, potential hazards such as pollution and deforestation could adversely affect this vibrant ecosystem. Invasive species also pose a significant threat, potentially causing irreparable harm. This situation is pressing, warranting immediate intervention and sustainable techniques to mitigate menacing threats and safeguard the ecosystem’s growth and survival. The current circumstance of Syracuse’s innovation sector highlights five crucial factors. First, the significant growth and the city’s robust, high-quality talent pool bolstered by top universities. Second, supportive resources from both public and private sectors driving innovation. Third, the authorities’ commitment to nurturing the innovation ecosystem. Fourth, a vibrant community of innovative companies creating a diverse environment that promotes progress. However, Syracuse’s innovation ecosystem faces a significant challenge in the lack of sufficient venture capital. This deficit impinges the sustainability and growth potential of budding companies. In addition, the limited network of potential mentors and industry experts magnifies these problems. The emigration of talented individuals poses another silent threat, highlighting the urgent need for retention strategies. To resolve these issues, the efforts of local governments, private investors, and academic institutions are crucial. Another issue in Syracuse’s ecosystem is the ‘silo mentality’, which hinders collaboration and suppresses the business atmosphere’s collective energy. This isolation can also limit innovative ideas, stifle potential breakthroughs, and lead to missed opportunities. Inter-departmental and sectoral communication need to be encouraged and rewarded to disband the ‘silo mentality’ and foster an inclusive business environment. Replacing it with a culture of collective cooperation can lead to an enriched business environment within Syracuse’s ecosystem, where each sector works together leading to a more adaptive and successful organization. Syracuse’s prolonged economic downturn and sluggish job growth have resulted in regional pessimism, which could seriously har...",0

					The source for greater Aurora, Colorado				  MASSAPEQUA PARK, N.Y. | Donald Trump attended Thursday’s wake of a New York City police officer gunned down in the line of duty, as the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has made crime a focus of his third White House campaign and accused President Joe Biden of lacking toughness. Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news The visitation for Officer Jonathan Diller, who was fatally shot during a traffic stop on Monday, was being held in suburban Massapequa. Police said the 31-year-old Diller was shot below his bulletproof vest while approaching an illegally parked car in Queens. Diller, who was married and had a 1-year-old son, was rushed to a hospital, where he died. Trump’s visit comes as Biden was also in New York for a previously scheduled fundraiser with Democratic ex-presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Trump’s campaign made social media posts contrasting his visit with Biden’s fundraiser. Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung, in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, noted Trump’s visit and said, “Meanwhile, the Three Stooges — Biden, Obama, and Clinton — will be at a glitzy fundraiser in the city with their elitist, out-of-touch celebrity benefactors.” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday that the president has spoken with New York City’s mayor, but she said she didn’t have any “private communications to share” when asked if Biden had spoken to the family of the officer who was killed. Jean-Pierre said the administration’s hearts go out to the officer’s family. Speaking aboard Air Force One, she said that Biden has supported law enforcement throughout his entire career and took a dig at Trump’s record. “Violent crime surged under the previous administration,” Jean-Pierre said. “The Biden-Harris administration have done the polar opposite, taking decisive action from the very beginning to fund the police and achieving a historic reduction in crime.” Trump, who was accompanied by some of his senior campaign ad...",0

                SEATTLE – Washington State University (WSU) students in Pullman can expect to hear sounds of new construction at the former Johnson Hall site, as the next phase of its replacement begins spring 2024.

The new ARS Plant Sciences Building will house scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and WSU. Its construction will support the next generation of agricultural research in the Pacific Northwest between WSU and ARS, USDA's chief scientific in-house research agency. 

Replacing Johnson Hall aligns with USDA’s current science and research strategy, which establishes a scientific framework to transform the U.S. food system and support our nation’s farmers, ranchers, producers and foresters.

The project is one of two the USACE Seattle District Interagency and International Section (IIS) is managing on behalf of USDA ARS, providing technical assistance to non-Department of Defense federal agencies, tribal nations, states and local governments, international organizations and foreign governments.

IIS work involves planning, environmental assessments, design, and construction contract oversight for the contract awarded to the Hensel Phelps Construction and Anderson Mason Dale Architects design-build team.

WSU's Johnson Hall was the fourth largest building on the Pullman campus and served as the university's hub for agricultural research since 1960 before being demolished in late 2023 – the largest demolition in WSU history.

“The WSU funded demolition of Johnson Hall got a lot attention, and for good reason because of the agriculture advancements made there,” said IIS Section Chief and Program Manager Alan Manville. “Despite our full-service mission supporting civil works and military programs, we don’t get the chance to work on a major university campus very often and it’s been a great experience working with the ARS and WSU researchers.”

The fully federally funded $103 million USDA project will provide lab and office space for plant biosciences research programs conducted jointly by 15 WSU and 15 ARS scientists, continuing one of the nation’s most robust federal-state partnerships that originally began in 1931.

Nearly 100,000 square feet of combined laboratory and office space will support four ARS Research Units: Wheat Health, Genetics and Quality; Grain Legume Genetics and Physiology; Northwest Sustainable Agroecosystems; Plant Germplasm Introduction and Testing.  

Additionally, members of the WSU Departments of Plant Pathology, Crop, Soil Sciences, and Horticulture will share lab and office space with federal researchers.

Contractor’s drilling piles and foundation work are the next major construction milestones, said Manville. “With most projects of this magnitude, you see the construction fence go up and then it takes a while for the foundation and utilities to go in, but folks will really see progress once ...",0

                                                 Does your dog understand when you say ‘fetch the ball’? A new study in Hungary says yes                                                  BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — Many dog owners believe their pets understand and respond not only to commands such as “sit” and “stay,” but also to words referring to their favorite objects. “Bring me your ball” will often result in exactly that.  But science has had trouble determining whether dogs and other animals genuinely activate a mental image in their minds when they hear the name of an object, something that would suggest a deeper grasp of language, similar to the kind that humans have.  A new study in Hungary has found that beyond being able to respond to commands like “roll over,” dogs can learn to associate words with specific objects — a relationship with language called referential understanding that had been unproven in dogs until now.  “When we are talking about objects, objects are external to the dogs, and dogs have to learn that words refer, they stand for something that is external to them,” said Marianna Boros, a cognitive neuroscientist and co-lead author of the study conducted by the Department of Ethology of the Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest. The study, which has been peer reviewed, was published last Friday in the science journal “Current Biology.” It involved 18 dogs and a non-invasive EEG procedure using electrodes attached to dogs’ heads to measure brain activity and register brain waves.  Dog owners participating in the study would play an audio clip in which they said the name of their dog’s toy — like “ball” or “frisbee” — and then they would show the dog an object. The researchers measured the dogs’ brain activity when the object in the recording matched the object that was displayed, and also when it differed.  “We expected that if a dog really understands the meaning of the object’s word, it will expect to see that object. And if the owner shows a different one, there will be a so-called surprise reaction in the brain,” Boros said. “And this is exactly what we found.”  The study found a different brain pattern when the dogs were shown an object that matched the word, compared to when it didn’t — suggesting the animals conjured a mental image of an object based on hearing the word for it.  Lilla Magyari, also a cognitive neuroscientist and co-lead author of the study, said that while other animals have been shown to have some degree of referential understanding of language, those animals have typically been highly trained to do so.  In dogs, she said, the findings show that such capacities appear to be inborn and require no special training or talent.  The study supports “theories of language evolution which actually say that referential understanding is not necessarily unique to humans,” added Magyari, who is als...",0

Immunisation compliance rises to 97% in Bayelsa ,2024-03-28T17:40:42+00:00,https://tribuneonlineng.com/immunisation-compliance-rises-to-97-in-bayelsa/,"Healthcare providers and nursing mothers in Bayelsa state have expressed satisfaction with the adoption of drone services to supply drugs and other medicals to hospitals in Bayelsa state, saying it has boosted immunization compliance by 97 per cent and addressed the issue of drug shortages, especially in the health facilities located in the remote areas. Bayelsa state government had 2022 entered a partnership with logistics delivery company, Zipline to enhance the preservation of crucial cold chain medications and expand the distribution of essential medical supplies to remote health facilities across the state. This situation has facilitated more than 13, 500 deliveries of medical supplies including 537,000 doses of vaccines to 210 health facilities in the state.  Speaking with newsmen who visited some medical facilities in the remote and riverain villages in Ogbia and Yenagoa local government areas of the state, some nursing mothers said they no longer have issues of unavailability of vaccines for children’s immunization in rural hospitals in the state. A nursing mother, Mrs Elizabeth Akpo, said at Otuokpoti Primary Heath Centre in Ogbia local government that previously some of her children could not get a complete dose of immunisation because the hospital always complaint about the availability of vaccines due to the accessibility of the area to Yenagoa, the state capital, but the situation is different now as her child gets vaccines any of her schedule date. She said: “Anytime I come, they attend to me quickly and there is always an injection anytime I come, they no longer give us any excuse, as a farmer, I don’t have much time to wait in the hospital, that is why I very happy with the recent healthcare attention to me in the hospital.  “The immunisation is very good, it makes the baby look perfect, I barely experience small sicknesses like malaria, stooling and measles, they fly our vaccines to the hospital from Yenagoa, and we are delighted. Also, the officer in charge of Otuokpoti Primary Heath Centre, Mrs Ase Adiogbogbo, said receiving drugs and medicals via drones helps in prompt service delivery and adequately attends to patients in an emergency. She said: “The experience has been wonderful, they are prompt in delivering the product, especially the vaccines we order from them, so whenever we request, they are prompt in bringing it and the drones, initially we were having issues but for now, everything is good, they drop at the proper site here in the hospital before we store them in our storage facility.  “Just like the situation of immunization, you know this is a rural hospital, we deal mostly with nursing mothers, there has been improvement in our healthcare delivery, because before now, sometimes it took time for the vaccine to get to us when it happened, we get out of stock, but now, there is no shortage of drugs, no complaint about abandoning of patients again due to lack of drugs.

The ballad of Buckley’s blowhard,2024-03-28T17:37:28+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/joe-lieberman-obituary/,"(Editor's note: The following obituary first appeared in Lawyers, Guns and Money, Erik's blog.) Born in 1942 in Stamford, Connecticut, Lieberman was the future blowhard of all blowhards. Lieberman’s father ran a liquor store and I’m surprised he didn’t later moralistically criticize this. He attended Yale and graduated with a BA in political science and economics in 1964. He then got a law degree from Yale in 1967. Yale is really responsible for so much. Like most other future lovers of war, Lieberman found ways out of fighting in Vietnam, first through educational deferments and then because he was married and had a child. He worked as an intern in the office of Abraham Ribicoff, a far superior Connecticut senator, meeting his first wife there, Betty Haas. He divorced her in 1981, primarily because she wasn’t observant enough in her Jewish faith for him. Lieberman was elected to the Connecticut state senate in 1970, where he served until losing his campaign for Congress in 1980. During those years, he was considered a “reform Democrat” and he rose quickly, serving as the body’s majority leader for the last six years of his tenure. But he came back in 1982 to win election as the state attorney general. He seems to have been relatively innocuous during these years, primarily working on enforcing environmental laws and consumer protection issues. But he already had a strong taste for centrism, the television lights and endless self-promotion. Lowell Weicker was actually pretty decent for a Republican, voting liberal on many positions, including foreign policy. This upset William F. Buckley. So in 1988, the dark prince himself decided to gin up rightwing support for the far more conservative Democratic candidate, Joe Lieberman. Buckley created bumper stickers that read “Does Lowell Weicker Make You Sick?” Buckley also introduced Lieberman to the state’s far-right Cuban community. He won the race over Weicker by 10,000 votes. Lieberman paid them back for their support by being as anti-Castro as anyone in the Senate. Joe Lieberman, at his best, was a moralistic jerk who constantly concern-trolled anyone to his left. He decided to make violence in video games a major early issue for some reason. Like other centrist Democratic moralists of the 1980s, such as Tipper Gore, Lieberman found innovation in popular culture a threat. He was all-in with the Democratic Leadership Council. In the aftermath of his 1994 reelection, which was a blowout in that horrible year since Republicans liked him too, Lieberman became the head of that most regrettable and annoying of all late 20th century political institutions, the Democratic Leadership Council. He was a huge proponent of the death penalty as well. On top of being the most blowhard centrist imaginable, Lieberman’s personal moralism was also central to his political persona. That came to the forefront during Bill Clinton’s issues with Monica Lewinsky. Now, while I don’t generally care about politicians personal ...",0
Boeing Sues Virgin Galactic Over Unpaid Invoices; Intellectual Property,2024-03-28T17:24:54+00:00,https://s30121.pcdn.co/aviation-news/boeing-sues-virgin-galactic-over-unpaid-invoices-intellectual-property/,"Boeing, on behalf of its subsidiary Aurora Flight Sciences, filed a lawsuit against Virgin Galactic for alleged unpaid bills and misappropriation of proprietary trade secrets. According to the March 21 filing, as reported by Spacenews.com, Mojave, California-based Virgin Galactic contracted with Aurora in July 2022 to design and build two new “mothership” aircraft designed to launch Virgin’s suborbital space vehicles. The first was to be delivered in 2025, designed to replace Virgin Galactic’s VMS Eve launch platform. Virginia-based Aurora has a history of innovative concept projects, including a 2002 demonstration aircraft designed to study atmospheric aspects of flying on Mars. It reached an altitude of 100,000 feet to simulate the low density of the atmosphere on the red planet. Another project in 2008 involved developing an uncrewed aircraft with a 1,000-pound payload designed to remain aloft in the stratosphere for five years under solar power. Boeing acquired Aurora in 2017. The Boeing lawsuit claims that work on the Virgin Galactic project stopped after completion of the second “task order” in May 2023. According to language in the filing, “Aurora concluded that it would not be possible for Virgin Galactic to produce the new Mothership Virgin Galactic wanted, on the budget available to it, on the timeline Virgin Galactic hoped to meet.” The suit claims invoices for work performed totaling $26.4 million have not been paid, despite multiple attempts to resolve the dispute. Boeing and Aurora also claim that Virgin Galactic refused to destroy proprietary technical specifications that model aircraft stability and control performance, and also proprietary data on composite construction. The “trade secrets” were inadvertently provided to Virgin Galactic as work on the mothership design progressed, according to the suit. Virgin Galactic did not immediately return an AVweb phone request for comment, but told SpaceNews, “We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend ourselves in the appropriate forum.” Sounds like a cash crunch has been in the making. Not surprising considering all of the other costs that are beginning to pile up due to all of the Boeing mishaps. The more the FAA looks, flying customers see, law suits pile up and carrier orders fall off, the more expensive it is to stay alive much less operate, or, break even for that matter. Boeing is in a world of hurt with no way out as far as I can see barring a government bail out. What’s a few more trillion added to the US debt for a Boeing bailout? Build Boeing Back Better Before Boeing Bails. Build Broken Boeing Back Better Before Boeing Bails. Compadres: In light of Boeing’s lawsuit against Virgin Galactic, a constructive approach demands both companies swiftly address their legal and financial disputes to minimize harm to the aerospace industry. This situation underscores the critical need for clear contracts, respect for intellectual property, an...",0

                LIMA, Peru – Leaders and scientists with Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU) SOUTH spoke about their experiences in Navy Medicine during a panel discussion, “Women in the Sciences,” held by the command at the U.S. Embassy in Peru on March 20, as part of Women’s History Month.

The panel, held in English and Spanish and featuring the command’s American and Peruvian personnel, featured discussion driven by experiences in STEM, and questions from personnel in attendance. Questions addressed to the panel covered a range of topics, to include ongoing work at the command, and inclusion in STEM.

“Science does not have borders.” Dr. Sonia Ampuero, a research scientist with NAMRU SOUTH, remarked. “To start your path in science, sometimes you only need a pencil and a piece of paper.”

The specialties of the panel’s members covered a broad range of NAMRU SOUTH competencies, to include surveillance of tropical illness, veterinary science and diagnostics. Panelists were able to speak to their experience and accomplishments in these areas, and in using their expertise to advance the readiness of the Fleet and the health of individuals in U.S. partner nations.

Panelists also acknowledged the help of teachers and predecessors who helped them succeed in the Navy, in STEM, and in life.

“We wouldn’t be where we are today in our careers if it weren’t for the mentors that we’ve had along the way,” said Cmdr. Kimberly Edgel, NAMRU SOUTH science director.

NAMRU SOUTH co-sponsored the panel with the U.S. Embassy Equity (DEIA) Council. 

Throughout Women’s History Month, NAMRU SOUTH and other commands in the Navy Medicine Research and Development enterprise strive to recognize the contributions of women to the U.S. Navy, and to Navy Medicine. Our women in research and development provide insight into the past, present, and potential roads ahead for the Navy and the nation.

Meet the winners of the 2024 Hilldale Awards,2024-03-28T15:49:12+00:00,https://news.wisc.edu/meet-the-winners-of-the-2024-hilldale-awards/,"Each year, to recognize their contributions to teaching, research and service, the faculty divisions honor four University of Wisconsin–Madison faculty members with the Hilldale Award.  Faculty members representing the arts and humanities, biological sciences, physical sciences and social sciences are selected from nominations submitted by department chairs. The winners will be awarded $7,500 and recognized at the April 1 Faculty Senate meeting.  This year’s Hilldale Award winners are Anja Wanner, Robert Landick, Robert Hamers, and Dietram Scheufele. Enid H. Anderson Professor of English in the College of Letters and Science Professor Anja Wanner is pictured at the Memorial Union Terrace. Photo: Bryce Richter Anja Wanner is an expert in English linguistics, particularly the study of syntax. Her work connects theory with application by considering not only the meaning of words but also the way they are structured in a sentence. Her work has grown to focus on grammatical structures that can only be analyzed in context, prompting her to explore conventions in genres and how they have changed over time. She has also collaborated on an analysis of conversations between persons diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease and their visitors, offering new insights into appropriate ways of measuring those patients’ linguistic competence.  Though grammar tends to be thought of as a dry and technical subject, Wanner brings enthusiasm, humor and passion to the classroom, whether she is teaching undergraduate or graduate students. She inspires even the most hesitant of students to fall in love with syntax and embraces the use of new technologies to enhance student engagement with and understanding of course materials both in and out of the classroom. Wanner has expanded the benefits of the Writing Center by restructuring departmental programs focused on student writing resources under the unified Center for Teaching and Research on Writing. This has helped focus their goals and outreach efforts to better serve more people across campus, especially historically underserved groups.   She served as the department chair during the early days and height of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which she led the department with optimism, empathy, and clarity. As part of her priority to better serve traditionally underrepresented groups of students, she led a faculty cluster hire that resulted in the hiring of 10 new faculty members, six of whom are faculty of color. She has also served on many shared governance committees such as the Arts & Humanities Divisional Committee, the University Committee, and the Committee for Faculty Rights and Responsibilities.  “She is world-class — an exemplar of what it means to be a faculty member. She is dedicated to colleagues and students, to local projects and campus-wide initiatives, to enduring questions and emerging challenges,” says Christa J. Olson, chair of the Department of English.

Nooks or knoll? Vancouver wants your thoughts on new False Creek park,2024-03-28T15:22:36+00:00,https://globalnews.ca/news/10389415/false-creek-east-park-designs/,"Instructions: Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first. 
				If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.			 The City of Vancouver wants your input into the design of a new waterfront park in southeast False Creek. Currently dubbed “East Park,” the site occupies a narrow tranche of land from East First Avenue and Ontario Street to the south side of Science World. The Vancouver Park Board has released two concept designs for the south end of the park, along with plans to upgrade the Ontario Greenway. The first design is presented as the “Braid” option, which would see the Seaside Greenway bend to the south creating “inviting nooks for social interaction” and lawns and plazas near the water. At the south end, the park would have a network of braided paths through a grove of trees meant to provide songbird habitat. The second option, known as the “Breathe” design, is more focused on open space. The Seaside Greenway would take a more direct path along the waterfront, and the park would feature a mounded slope with mountain views to the north and sun to the south. The south end of the park would feature pollinator meadows and picnic areas shaded by trees. Both designs would feature bio-retention areas designed to capture clean rainwater. A concept design for the park’s waterfront has yet to be released, and a final name has not been decided. The public can weigh in on the two concept designs through an online survey until April 16, or attend an open house on April 13. A final concept plan is slated to be presented to the park board in fall 2024.       The email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.

Image: Invest NI Additional funding will support AI and data science postgraduate qualifications to be delivered by Ulster University and Queen’s University Belfast. Invest Northern Ireland has announced a new Artificial Intelligence Collaboration Centre based at Ulster University that will help businesses in the country adopt AI to boost their competitiveness and productivity. Formally launched at an event in Ulster University’s Belfast campus today (28 March), the AI centre has been established following a five-year £16.3m investment from Invest NI, the economic development agency in Northern Ireland, and the country’s Department for the Economy. Invest NI said the AI centre will help business across a range of industries, from logistics and finance to life sciences, manufacturing and agritech, benefit from advances in the emerging technology that has taken the world by storm. Conor Murphy, the economy minister of Northern Ireland, said that this investment will help businesses ensure that the potential of AI is “diffused and applied to a broad business base” which will encourage economic growth and benefit the people of the country. “This collaborative project, with bases in Belfast and Derry, will serve as a hub for innovation, bringing together research expertise and industry professionals to collaborate on cutting-edge projects and solutions,” he said. “The centre, the people who work there and the important work it will deliver will be an important contributor to my wider economic vision as we aim to raise productivity, promote regional balance, reduce carbon emissions and deliver good jobs.” As part of the announcement, Murphy said that the Department for the Economy has offered nearly £2.5m to support additional AI and data science postgraduate qualifications to be delivered by Ulster University and Queen’s University Belfast (QUB) to “expand the capacity of our talent pipeline” and meet the needs of industry. A collaboration between Ulster University and QUB, the AI centre will also encourage greater industrial innovation and collaboration with academia to increase both local and foreign direct investment. “AI is one of the most important technological developments of the modern era and has the potential to deliver important benefits such as R&D excellence, skills development and increased competitiveness,” said Dónal Durkan, executive director of strategy and partnerships at Invest NI. “With some 100 local companies already currently using AI technologies in their operations we have an excellent foundation to build upon our capabilities locally. As a region, we are already recognised as an area of excellence in the realm of Big Data and data analytics. “We now have the opportunity to make our mark in the AI arena and to realise the economic benefits that will co...",0

Hailey Bieber gets real about her struggle with 'Perioral Dermatitis',2024-03-28T15:02:38+00:00,https://www.hellomagazine.com/hfm/beauty-trends/516382/hailey-bieber-skin-perioral-dermatitis/,"Subscribe According to dermatologists, perioral dermatitis is on the rise and even celebrities aren't immune to this often misunderstood skin condition.  Opening up on TikTok about her struggles with perioral dermatitis, model Hailey Bieber explained how she'd suffered from the condition since she was 19 and revealed exactly how she deals with it. Speaking candidly to camera, Hailey mentions the flare-up she's currently experiencing and what products she relies on to calm symptoms. ""At night I use a prescription azelaic acid cream which really helps with the inflammation of the perioral dermatitis and in the daytime I use something called Clindamycin which is also a prescription that you can get from a dermatologist."" ""The only other things that I use when I'm having a flare-up of perioral dermatitis would be our Rhode Glazing Milk. It's super gentle, it helps calm the skin, it doesn't irritate it any further.""  MORE: Hailey Bieber channels 'coastal cowgirl' in itsy bitsy red bikini and cowboy hat RELATED: Should your skincare routine follow a particular order? Perioral dermatitis can often be confused with acne as both lead to small red bumps on the skin but the two conditions are very different. ""Perioral dermatitis is a skin condition that typically affects areas around the mouth (but not the skin directly next to the lip edge), nose-to-mouth creases and the chin. Those with perioral dermatitis will usually see lots of tiny bumps that look the same, often joining up to create larger affected areas. The skin may also be red, dry and flaky,"" explains dermatologist, Dr Sam Bunting. Perioral Dermatitis! Lets talk about it!!  ""I have seen a huge rise in clinic of perioral dermatitis, largely due to people mis-diagnosing the condition, confusing it for other things and therefore treating it incorrectly, which ends up making it worse,"" says dermatologist Dr Emma Craythorne. ""There are other issues which can contribute – the layering of multiple products, often containing a high percentage of actives, can cause huge irritation. In addition, parabens are being used less in formulations and replacement preservative options can also cause flare-ups.""  If you're currently experiencing a flare-up, Dr Sam Bunting suggests a complete rethink of your skincare and makeup routine. ""The first thing I do is to suspend the current skincare regime (and frequently impose a makeup cull, too). A non-comedogenic regime is the order of the day. Sometimes this alone will be enough to solve the problem. If topical steroids are the cause, occasionally things will get worse before they get better. But stopping them is essential, so stick with it.""",0
"Hardship: 30,000 students have benefited from Ogun Educash initiative — Commissioner",2024-03-28T14:48:37+00:00,https://tribuneonlineng.com/hardship-30000-students-have-benefited-from-ogun-educash-initiative-commissioner/,"The Ogun State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Professor Abayomi Arigbagbu, has disclosed that no fewer than 20,000 students in tertiary institutions across the country from the state, have benefitted from the ongoing Educash transfer of N50,000. While adding that 10,000 indigent students in both primary and secondary schools also benefitted from the N10,000 cash transfer to cushion the current economic crisis. He stated this after monitoring the cash transfer to public primary and secondary schools at the Ogun West Senatorial District on Wednesday. The Commissioner in a statement available by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Lekan Adeniran, said more students would have benefitted from the gesture by the end of next week. The Commissioner promised that all students captured would be paid accordingly. He said: “I can tell you that for the one of the tertiary institutions, we have done 20,000 as at today, and the total for the tertiary institution beneficiaries is a little bit less than 50,000. Hopefully, by the end of next week, we will have reached half of that, which is about 25,000 beneficiaries. “I want to assure those who have not received theirs, for instance, Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), a list of a little bit over 12,000 was sent to us. As we speak now, we have paid just a little less than 6,000. The same thing at Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED), where we have a little bit less than 8,000. We have tried to make sure we are targeting between the range of 45% to 50% in all the schools,” he said. ALSO READ: About 10,000 final year students get Kwara govt bursary Arigbabu also said that the state government would not entertain cash payment during the ongoing exercise to students in public primary and secondary schools. He noted that the government would still avail any parent without a bank account an opportunity to do so as long as they have already been captured for the educash payment. “We are not going to pay cash to anybody; we are not going to handle cash. We are going to pay through the account. If that person doesn’t have an account, they need to open an account because it is difficult to trace cash transactions. “Today, as we have gone out, if I say I have paid 100 people, how will you confirm that? But, the one we have done through transfers, you can see it through bank statements and the alerts they receive. “We want to avoid anything that will make us pay cash. We won’t even pay cash, I can assure you. “Those who have not opened account, if the name was captured and sent to us, that is for primary and secondary beneficiaries, what we can do for that person is to allow him or her to open a bank account and send the details to us. “For parents whose children were selected in the primary and secondary as a result of indigency, we will look into that particular case. If we have a parent that has no account, we will allow him/her to open an account and send it to us,” he said. At the Chr...",0

Breakthrough for thousands of women carrying 'Angelina Jolie' cancer genes as scientists find a way to rev up their immune system to stop them needing mastectomies,2024-03-28T14:07:07+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-13248655/Hope-women-carrying-Angelina-Jolie-gene.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490,"By Xantha Leatham Deputy Science Editor   Published:  13:21, 28 March 2024   |  Updated:  14:07, 28 March 2024      13 View  comments  A drug breakthrough could help women with the Angelina Jolie cancer gene avoid surgery. Currently, women who carry a BRCA gene mutation are at higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Many opt for preventative treatment options such as a mastectomy. But new research indicates that giving drugs usually administered in the late stages of breast cancer to healthy people carrying the mutated BRCA genes could prevent them from developing the disease. In 2013, Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie revealed she had made the decision to undergo a double mastectomy after testing positive for mutations in the BRCA1 gene University of Cambridge academics discovered immune cells in the breast tissue of healthy women carrying faulty BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes showed signs of 'exhaustion'. This malfunction – usually found in late-stage tumours – suggests the immune cells cannot clear damaged cells, which eventually lead to cancer. Senior author Professor Walid Khaled said immunotherapy drugs which overcome this block in function already exist. He said: 'We're very excited about this discovery because it opens up potential for a preventative treatment other than surgery for carriers of BRCA breast cancer gene mutations. 'Drugs already exist that can overcome this block in immune cell function but so far they've only been approved for late-stage disease.' Immunotherapy helps the immune system recognise and fight cancer. It can be administered on its own or alongside other treatments. 'No-one has really considered using them in a preventative way before,' Professor Khaled added. 'However, these drugs do have serious side effects and we are working now on testing these in pre-clinical models to determine a safe dosage before moving to human studies.' About one in every 400 people carry the faulty BRCA genes. According to the NHS out of 100 women with a BRCA1 gene mutation, between 65 and 85 will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. Between 40 and 63 will develop ovarian cancer. Out of 100 women with the BRCA2 mutation, between 40 and 85 will develop breast cancer at some point in their life. In some cases, patients with the faulty genes may be offered risk-reducing surgery, which removes tissue such as breasts or ovaries, that could become cancerous. In 2013, Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie revealed she had made the decision to undergo a double mastectomy after testing positive for mutations in the BRCA1 gene. Cancer Research UK has granted the Cambridge team a Biology to Prevention Award to test the method in mice and will closely monitor side effects and dosage. After this, a pilot clinical trial could be carried out in women with BRCA gene mutations. Professor Khaled added: 'The best way to prevent breast cancer is to really understand how it develops in the first place. Then we can identify these early changes and intervene. 'Late-s...",0

CREDIT: Bo Sha, Department of Enviromental Science, Stockholm University By Eurasia Review  A new study by researchers at the Department of Environmental Science, Stockholm University, published in Science Advances, reveals that PFAS re-emit into the air from crashing ocean waves at levels comparable to or greater than other sources, establishing a cyclical transport process for these “forever chemicals” between land and sea. “The common belief is that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, PFAS, drain from the land into the oceans where they stay to be diluted into the deep oceans over the timescale of decades,” said Ian Cousins, Professor at the Department of Environmental Science and co-author of the study. “But we’ve now demonstrated in multiple studies that there’s a boomerang effect, and some of the toxic PFAS are re-emitted to air, transported long distances and then deposited back onto land.” Field experiments across the Atlantic Ocean conducted by co-authors Bo Sha, Post-doc at the Department of Environmental Science and Jana Johansson, former Researcher at the Department of Environmental Science, currently at Linköping University, showed PFAS concentrations in air particles surpassing seawater concentrations by over 100,000 times. Subsequent global modeling estimated the re-emission, atmospheric transport, and deposition of PFAS to land. “Jana (Johansson) and I worked intensively for two months on a ship conducting multiple field experiments with our custom-built sea spray simulator,” explained Bo Sha, the main author of the study. “While our results are scientifically impactful, they are disconcerting, creating a lot of interest among scientists, regulators, and the public.” PFAS, characterized by their extreme persistence leading to their colloquial designation as “forever chemicals, ”are associated with a variety of serious health conditions, including cancer, fertility issues, and compromised immune system function. “In Denmark, scientists have compiled compelling evidence indicating that the sea serves as the primary source of PFAS along their west coast,” explained Matthew Salter, Researcher at the Department of Environmental Science and co-author of the study. “This aligns with our expectations, as our study predicts that coastal regions bear the greatest impact.” Your email address will not be published.

Massive Calgary exhibit showcases rare H.G. Wells books,2024-04-05T21:03:58+00:00,https://globalnews.ca/news/10404275/calgary-hg-wells-exhibit-books/,"Instructions: Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first. 
				If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.			 This month brings a rare chance for Calgarians to check out some local treasures not many people know about. An exhibit featuring the work of British author H.G. Wells pays tribute to one of the giants of science fiction. Staff at the University of Calgary are now putting together an exhibit showcasing Wells’ books and other materials dating back to the 1890s. Over the years, the university has amassed one of North America’s biggest collections of H.G. Wells items. “It’s massive,” curator Annie Murray said. The display Murray is finalizing includes British and American first editions of such Wells classics as The Time Machine, The Invisible Man and The War of the Worlds. The exhibit highlights how so much of the future Wells depicted in his work has now become part of our daily reality. “These are some of the things Wells imagined in his books: television, video-conferencing, wireless communication, networked computers, online shopping,” Murray said. The exhibit, “H.G. Wells: A Scientific Romance,” runs from April 11 to July 19 in the Nickle Galleries at the U of C’s Taylor Family Digital Library. “H.G. Wells was so popular that postcards were made of him,” Murray said, referring to one of the items included in the exhibit. Murray and others connected with the exhibit will be displaying some of the items at the Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo, which runs from April 25 to April 28 at Stampede Park. “It’s where the sci-fi nerds are,” Murray said with a laugh. About 130 years after first getting so many people fired up about the future, Wells is still very much a man of the moment. “The Island of Doctor Moreau from 1896 talked about manipulating animals’ genes, operating on humans and turning them into beasts, a good early example of a mad scientist,” Murray said. “There is actually going to be a new movie of this and Anthony Hopkins is going to be Doctor Moreau.” The email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.

 Business  Agencies April 6, 2024  To explore collaboration opportunities, a delegation from KATOP, a Chinese company specializing in solutions for lithium-ion batteries visited the National University of Science and Technology (NUST) and had detailed discussions with University officials. The delegation included the Vice President Zhou Yan, PMO Manager Aqeel Khan, Project Delivery Manager Wasif Noor, and Muhammad Javed Iqbal, an alumnus of SEECS 2012 and Representative of KATOP in Pakistan. According to Gwadar Pro,  they held a meeting with NUST Leadership, including Pro-Rector RIC Dr. Rizwan Riaz and DG Projects Dr. Saeed Ur Rehman Sarwar and discussed potential areas of partnership. During their visit, the delegation toured various laboratories at USPCASE where research on Energy Storage devices is currently underway. They also visited selected labs at SINES, observing the working between industry and academia at NUST. Later, they had also a visit to National Science and Technology park (NSTP), where they gained insights into the entrepreneurial ecosystem fostered at NUST. The KATOP delegation has visited Pakistan at a crucial time when the country needs large amounts of green energy to reduce its reliance on fossil fuel-generated electricity. Lithium-ion batteries are particularly needed, as they are used in hybrid solar systems, electric vehicles, and other energy storage applications. Pakistan urgently requires lithium battery production, especially in the special economic zones (SEZs) that will be established under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)  the report added.

All the Citizen Science Projects You Can Participate in During the Eclipse,2024-04-05T20:25:00+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/all-the-citizen-science-projects-you-can-participate-in-1851388182,"Several eclipse-focused projects are set to make big scientific contributions this coming Monday, April 8. While many projects are already in full swing, there’s still time for you to take part and contribute. It’s nearly go time, with the Great North America Solar Eclipse set to carve a path from Mexico through to Canada’s maritime provinces. The upcoming celestial spectacle isn’t just a marvel to behold—it’s also an opportunity for serious science projects that rely heavily on citizen scientists to collect valuable data.  This NASA-led global citizen science initiative allows volunteers to engage in Earth science research through a smartphone app (details on the app here). Participants, by using this temporary feature in the GLOBE Observer app, can contribute by documenting cloud types, tracking land cover (i.e. vegetation at the data collection site), and recording atmospheric conditions, such as temperature drops, during the solar eclipse.  This wide-ranging data collection supports Earth system science research, which is made accessible to scientists and students, and is open to anyone with a smartphone. And the good news: No specialized knowledge required. Funded by NASA Science Activation, Eclipse Soundscapes is a unique project that will gather multi-sensory observations and sound data during the upcoming solar eclipse to study its impact on local ecosystems. Participants contribute by taking recordings before, during, and after the eclipse, helping researchers understand how these events affect animal and plant behavior. As observers, “you will go outside on eclipse day to record information about your location and what you hear, see, or feel” during the total solar eclipse, according to the program’s website. Observations can be taken from on, near, or off the eclipse path. The project is inclusive and designed for accessibility, inviting both sighted and visually impaired individuals to engage in eclipse science through sensory experiences. You can sign up to be an observer here, but you have to take a free online training course first.  NASA’s SunSketcher project tasks volunteers with measuring the Sun’s shape during the solar eclipse using a free smartphone app. Participants are asked to take timed photos to capture Baily’s Beads, revealing insights into the Sun’s structure and testing theories of gravity. A video tutorial can be accessed here. “The 2024 Eclipse offers an unprecedented opportunity to measure the shape of the Sun and so to infer its inner structure,” explains principal investigator Gordon Emslie. “The SunSketcher project will use smartphone observations by Citizen Scientists situated along the two-thousand-mile-long eclipse path from Texas to Maine to reveal the precise shape of the solar disk.” The Eclipse Megamovie project involves capturing the dynamics of the solar corona, including jets and plumes, during a total solar eclipse using DSLR cameras mounted to a tripod.

 Sports  Reuters April 6, 2024  Double Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin and Aleksander Aamodt Kilde of Norway have announced their engagement. The Alpine skiing pair posted photos on social media of a beaming Shiffrin showing off a ring. Kilde, who is recovering from a January crash that cut his season short, said it was too early to say when the wedding day would be. “It will probably come when we have settled down, so it will probably be a few more years,” the 31-year-old added. The two confirmed their relationship in May 2021. American Shiffrin won her 97th World Cup victory last month to extend her record haul and further cement her place as the greatest Alpine skier of all time. Speed specialist Kilde, who was the men’s overall World Cup champion in 2020, was airlifted off the course in Wengen after suffering a deep cut into his right calf and a dislocated right shoulder in the crash a downhill race.

CERN Physicists Measure One of Key Parameters of Standard Model,2024-04-05T20:11:24+00:00,https://www.sci.news/physics/leptonic-electroweak-mixing-angle-12826.html,"Physicists with the CMS Collaboration at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have successfully measured the effective leptonic electroweak mixing angle. Their result, presented at the annual Rencontres de Moriond Conference, is the most precise measurement performed at a hadron collider to date and is in good agreement with the prediction from the Standard Model of particle physics. Installation of the CMS beam pipe. Image credit: CERN / CMS Collaboration. The Standard Model is the most precise description to date of particles and their interactions. Precise measurements of its parameters, combined with precise theoretical calculations, yield spectacular predictive power that allows phenomena to be determined even before they are directly observed. In this way, the model successfully constrained the masses of the W and Z bosons, of the top quark and, most recently, of the Higgs boson. Once these particles had been discovered, these predictions became consistency checks for the model, allowing physicists to explore the limits of the theory’s validity. At the same time, precision measurements of the properties of these particles are a powerful tool for searching for new phenomena beyond the Standard Model — the so-called ‘new physics’ — since new phenomena would manifest themselves as discrepancies between various measured and calculated quantities. The electroweak mixing angle is a key element of these consistency checks. It is a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model, determining how the unified electroweak interaction gave rise to the electromagnetic and weak interactions through a process known as electroweak symmetry breaking. At the same time, it mathematically ties together the masses of the W and Z bosons that transmit the weak interaction. So, measurements of the W, the Z or the mixing angle provide a good experimental cross-check of the model. The two most precise measurements of the weak mixing angle were performed by experiments at CERN’s LEP collider and by the SLD experiment at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The values disagree with each other, which had puzzled physicists for over a decade. The new result is in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction and is a step towards resolving the discrepancy between the latter and the LEP and SLD measurements. “This result shows that precision physics can be carried out at hadron colliders,” said Dr. Patricia McBride, spokesperson of the CMS Collaboration. “The analysis had to handle the challenging environment of LHC Run 2, with an average of 35 simultaneous proton-proton collisions.” “This paves the way for more precision physics at the High-Luminosity LHC, where five times more proton pairs will be colliding simultaneously.” Precision tests of the Standard Model parameters are the legacy of electron-positron colliders, such as CERN’s LEP, which operated until 2000 in the tunnel that now houses the LHC. Electron-positron collisions provide a perfect clean environ...",0

Norwescon’s 46th year reunites thousands of devoted fans in SeaTac,2024-04-05T19:41:38+00:00,https://b-townblog.com/norwescons-46th-year-reunites-thousands-of-devoted-fans-in-seatac/,"The B-Town (Burien) Blog 
Local News, Events, Politics, Crime, Business, Arts & more for Burien, WA  Story & Photos by Taylor RichmondUW News Lab Around 2,000 science fiction and fantasy fans gathered for the 46th Norwescon in SeaTac last week at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel. Known as the premier science fiction and fantasy convention for the Pacific Northwest, the four-day celebration of literature, art, costuming, fiction, and science brought back lifelong aficionados and raised key issues affecting their work. Elizabeth McKinney’s first Norwescon was in 1998, and this year marked her 20th time attending. She has a familial connection to the convention; her parents met at Norwescon, and years later, her sister took her first steps at the same hotel. “They were letting her crawl up the staircase,” she said, “and then when she got up to the first landing, she decided she’d had enough of crawling.” Her parents’ astonished exclamations, “Did she just take her first steps at a convention?” highlight the significance of Norwescon in her family’s history. As a Norwescon veteran, McKinney proudly displayed her collection of ribbons that attendees could obtain by participating in different events, visiting booths, or volunteering. At that point, she had 42 ribbons in total. Norwescon Chair SunnyJim Morgan told The SeaTac Blog that the lifelong experiences keep the community committed to the annual event. “These conventions are a bunch of nerds getting together throwing the party they want to go to,” she said. “It kind of morphs and changes with the community, but it really sticks with that community.” An estimated 500 hours of content were available during the four-day event. “Our programming is really the bulk of what we’re offering members,” she said. “That’s the difference between a Norwescon and a Comicon. Comicon is a lot of stuff to buy with a little bit of programming. We’re a little stuff to buy and a lot of programming.” This year’s variety of programming included an early morning game of laser tag using vintage Star Wars equipment, a midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, board game competitions, themed charades and hundreds of panels. Morgan attributes the people as the main reason the convention has been able to go on for so long. Particularly important are the nearly 200 volunteers who help the convention run in some capacity. In fact, Norwescon is one of the largest entirely volunteer-run regional conventions in the United States. Even the leadership team is made up of volunteers. “None of the staff get paid at all,” joked Morgan. “We get a really screaming deal on our memberships.” Also important are the vendors looking to sell their creations. Nina Himes was there selling jewelry and other artwork. She is a full-time tattoo artist and only attends one to two conventions as a vendor. She prefers smaller conventions like Norwescon. “It’s way more personable,” she said, comparing it to some of the larger conventions she’s been...",0

Science students at Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired have figured out a way to experience the eclipse,2024-04-05T19:32:37+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/04/05/total-solar-eclipse-blind-visually-impaired-experience/,"While eclipse watchers look to the skies, people who are blind or visually impaired will be able to hear and feel the celestial event. Sound and touch devices will be available at public gatherings on April 8, when a total solar eclipse crosses North America, the moon blotting out the sun for a few minutes. “Eclipses are very beautiful things, and everyone should be able to experience it once in their lifetime,” said Yuki Hatch, a high school senior in Austin, Texas. Hatch is a visually impaired student and a space enthusiast who hopes to one day become a computer scientist for NASA. On eclipse day, she and her classmates at the Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired plan to sit outside in the school’s grassy quad and listen to a small device called a LightSound box that translates changing light into sounds. When the sun is bright, there will be high, delicate flute notes. As the moon begins to cover the sun, the mid-range notes are those of a clarinet. Darkness is rendered by a low clicking sound. “I’m looking forward to being able to actually hear the eclipse instead of seeing it,” said Hatch. The LightSound device is the result of a collaboration between Wanda Díaz-Merced, an astronomer who is blind, and Harvard astronomer Allyson Bieryla. Díaz-Merced regularly translates her data into audio to analyze patterns for her research. A prototype was first used during the 2017 total solar eclipse that crossed the U.S., and the handheld device has been used at other eclipses. This year, they are working with other institutions with the goal of distributing at least 750 devices to locations hosting eclipse events in Mexico, the U.S., and Canada. They held workshops at universities and museums to construct the devices, and provide DIY instructions on the group’s website. “The sky belongs to everyone. And if this event is available to the rest of the world, it has to be available for the blind, too,” said Díaz-Merced. “I want students to be able to hear the eclipse, to hear the stars.” The Perkins Library — associated with the Perkins School for the Blind in Watertown, Massachusetts — plans to broadcast the changing tones of the LightSound device over Zoom for members to listen online and by telephone, said outreach manager Erin Fragola. In addition to students, many of the library’s senior patrons have age-related vision loss, he said. “We try to find ways to make things more accessible for everyone,” he said. Others will experience the solar event through the sense of touch, with the Cadence tablet from Indiana’s Tactile Engineering. The tablet is about the size of a cellphone with rows of dots that pop up and down. It can be used for a variety of purposes: reading Braille, feeling graphics and movie clips, playing video games. For the eclipse, “A student can put their hand over the device and feel the moon slowly move over the sun,” said Tactile Engineering’s Wunji Lau. The Indiana School for the Blind and Visually Impaired started incorpo...",0

Pope Francis is claiming legal immunity as a head of state to fight a damages claim brought by two Aboriginal men over the Vatican’s failure to protect them from the priest who sexually abused them as children. Documents filed in the Victorian Supreme Court last month by lawyers representing the Pope flag the church’s intention to rely on the Vatican’s unique status in international law to stop the pontiff from being drawn into a civil lawsuit involving one of Australia’s most notorious paedophile priests. Hold on to your hat: A claim by Pope Francis for immunity from an Australian court is likely to gain international attention.Credit: Andrew Medichini Renowned human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson KC said the case raised questions about the Vatican’s century-old claim to statehood and technical legal defences it has previously employed to escape accountability for crimes against children committed by its priests. Speaking to this masthead from London, he said the case was likely to gain international attention. “If it does reach the stage of answering the vexed question of whether the Vatican is in practice a state, it could have considerable consequences,” Robertson said. The case centres on the abuse of two Aboriginal boys by Michael Glennon, a serial child rapist who despite being convicted and jailed for the indecent assault of a girl in 1978, remained an ordained priest for the next 20 years. At the time of Glennon’s death, he was in jail for crimes against 15 children.

In response, lawyers for Pope Francis have challenged the jurisdiction of the court. They argue that, as ruler of the Vatican City and Holy See, the Pope is a head of state and under Australia’s Foreign States Immunities Act, immune from any proceeding before an Australian court.

"Science has no gender, say top women scientists",2024-04-05T17:45:01+00:00,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/science-has-no-gender-say-top-women-scientists-888547,"Hyderabad: Declaring that science has no gender, a top DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) scientist said that the participation of women in the premier defence research institute has increased manifold in the last couple of decades. “DRDO had just one or two per cent of women working with it when I joined it. Now women make up 12 to 15 per cent of DRDO’s staff and they are now leading from the front. The system is slowly evolving. Science has no gender,” DRDO’s aeronautical systems director general Dr. Tessy Thomas said on Friday. She was speaking at a seminar organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI)’s Ladies Organisation (FLO) on ‘Stellar Journeys’. Apart from Dr Thomas, Kalpana Kalahasti of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) participated in the seminar. Talking with FLO chairperson Priya Gazdar, Kalahasti said, “While women scientists and engineers have been contributing to every project of Isro, men and women, boys and girls have played equal roles. It was a team effort. The success of Chandrayaan-3 was the culmination of the teamwork of men and women.” She said it was her childhood dream to work on missile development. “I was fascinated by the missile world. I used to run out of the house and watch the sky aeroplanes soaring high,” she said. The Isro scientist said, “In a world that valorises brute force and aggressive competition, FLO and organisations like FLO, stand as harbingers of change.”",0

Short On Time? A 15-minute Workout May Help Boost Your Immune System ,2024-04-05T16:15:35+00:00,http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/808419/?sc=rsla,"sign up for the wires and see archived wires  Browse experts available to comment on breaking news Request an expert contact, get responses directly to your inbox Find an expert by topic in a comprehensive database Rebekah Hunt Newswise — Long Beach, Calif. (April 5, 2024)—Exercising at moderate intensity for just 15 minutes may be all that is needed to boost immunity by increasing levels of natural killer (NK) cells. Researchers will present their work this week at the American Physiology Summit in Long Beach, California. The Summit is the flagship annual meeting of the American Physiological Society (APS).NK cells are a type of white blood cell and are a first-line defense in the immune system. Their primary job is a “search and destroy” mission to eliminate infected cells—including cancerous cells—in the body. NK cells are called “natural killers” because they can identify and kill dangerous cells without having previous exposure to the abnormal pathogens.Previous research has found that exercise increases levels of NK cells in the bloodstream, which can provide a period of heightened immunity. “Mobilizing more of these cells can lead to protecting the body against infections, reduces the likelihood of developing certain diseases, and helps to improve disease outcomes by controlling infections more effectively,” explained Rebekah Hunt, a PhD candidate at the University of Houston and first author of the study.In this new study, a group of 10 volunteers between the ages of 18 and 40 exercised on a stationary bicycle for 30 minutes at moderate intensity. The researchers drew the volunteers’ blood before the cycling session and again at the 15- and 30-minute marks. The research team found NK cell levels in the blood increased after 15 minutes of exercise but did not reach higher levels after 30 minutes of cycling.This potential boost to the immune system may be particularly notable for people with cancer, as NK cells are known to kill tumor cells. Exercising for mere minutes before seeing an increase in NK cells can be encouraging for people who have trouble finding time to exercise or prefer shorter workouts, as “our results don’t point to a clear advantage in terms of increasing NK cells in the bloodstream by exercising for longer than 15 minutes at a moderate intensity,” Hunt said.NOTE TO JOURNALISTS: The American Physiology Summit will be held April 4–7, 2024, in Long Beach, California.

					The Black Media Authority				 By Ariyana Griffin Special to the AFRO  Tuskegee University (TU) has announced $6.7 million in federal funding aimed at the launch of a new aviation degree program in the fall. The funding was sponsored by Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.).  According to information released in a statement, the Tuskegee aviation degree program will grant students the opportunity to earn a bachelor’s degree in aviation science  on a pilot track. The program will begin with a cohort of 25 students and is expected to expand to over 200.  The aviation degree will consist of two components. Students must first understand the general education core and aviation science related courses in aerodynamics, aircraft structures, aircraft propulsion, performance stability and control as well as meteorology. They then will begin flight training where students will be able to take the appropriate FAA certification for private and commercial pilot certificates. Students will get the unique opportunity to earn their flight hours on Moton Field, the same area where the historic Tuskegee airmen flew.  Sign up for our Daily eBlast to get coverage on Black communities from the media company who has been doing it right for over 130 years. The program is still awaiting approval from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges. A main goal of the degree program is to not only introduce aviation to a new generation of students but to also help aid the shortage of pilots which is expected to increase.   “This program  is important because at Tuskegee the history of the Airmen shows that learning trades and skills is fundamental in building a self-sufficient lifestyle,” said Angelo Burrell, a junior at TU. “I believe this flight school will open doors and opportunities that minorities never had. I personally do not know any pilots back home in Los Angeles so to be able to participate in this and show my community they can do it too is everything.” According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, “about 16,800 openings for airline and commercial pilots are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.” Commercial pilots are mandated to retire at 65 years old. “The most exciting part is the opportunity to train our students to become pilots,” said S. Keith Hargrove, Ph.D., provost and senior vice president for TU. “In the tra...",0

                                                 Austria likely to be largely ice-free within 45 years as glaciers recede quickly, experts say                                                  VIENNA (AP) — Austrian glaciers receded last year at a rapid pace and the Alpine country is likely to be largely ice-free in 40 to 45 years as the process continues, experts said Friday. The Austrian Alpine Club said that, of the 93 glaciers its volunteers measured and observed, all but one receded in 2022-2023.  The 79 glaciers measured both last year and the previous year were an average 23.9 meters (78 feet) shorter than a year earlier, it said in an annual report. That was the third-highest figure of shrinkage in both the club’s 133 years of measurements and in the past seven years. The retreat of 14 other glaciers was observed less precisely, for example by comparing photos. The biggest retreat was that of Austria’s biggest glacier — the Pasterze, in the Glockner mountain group in the southern province of Carinthia — which shrank by 203.5 meters (668 feet), a record for that glacier.  Gerhard Lieb, the co-leader of the club’s glacier measurement service, said Austria’s glaciers can no longer be saved and their disappearance in the coming decades is “unstoppable.”  The process of forming snow reserves at the upper ends of glaciers so that they can stabilize takes decades, “and the time is up,” he added. “That means nothing can be done anymore.”  “There might be some remnants in shadowed locations — maybe at the Glockner glacier on the north-east side, some areas in the Oetztal valley,” said the service’s other co-leader, Andreas Kellerer-Pirklbauer. “But de facto, in 40 to 45 years all of Austria will be pretty much ice-free.” The experts, both of whom work at the University of Graz’s geography institute, said that the continued existence of Austria’s glaciers is down entirely to ice reserves from the past. Kellerer-Pirklbauer said that “a late but very long and warm melting period in 2023” was the main culprit in the latest numbers. Last year’s average figure for glacier retreat fell short of the record set in 2021-2022 of 28.7 meters (94.2 feet). But no glacier receded by more than 100 meters that year, and two did in the latest report: Alongside the Pasterze, Tyrol province’s Rettenbachferner glacier was 127 meters (416.7 feet) shorter. Only one glacier, the Baerenkopfkees in the Glockner group, was unchanged in length last year. Glaciers are masses of ice that form as snow and ice compact over centuries and then flow slowly over land. Their melting is one of the most notable indications of human-caused climate change, with glaciers around the world rapidly retreating. Experts in neighboring Switzerland said in September that that country saw 4% of its total glacier volume disappear in 2023, the second-biggest decline in a single year...",0
Meet N.C. A&#038;T&#8217;s New Student Body President: Kylie Rice,2024-04-05T14:06:09+00:00,https://ncatregister.com/22360/the-yard/meet-n-c-ats-new-student-body-president-kylie-rice/,"Anticipation filled the air as N.C. A&T’s election committee read the results of the student election. “Your SGA President is….Kylie Rice,” the committee said. Applause erupted from onlookers, and the feeling of victory set in.  Kylie Rice has done it and will serve as the 2024-25 SGA President. The rising senior majors in political science and minors in journalism and mass communication. Rice is also a Dowdy Scholar, a full-ride scholarship granted to incoming freshmen who excel academically during their high school matriculation. Rice has participated in student government during her entire college tenure. She previously served as the freshman class president and a judicial council member, and she currently serves as the attorney general.  “It’s draining, but it’s fun,” Rice said. “It’s something I have a passion for, which is why it is something I have done for all four years.” She is also extremely involved in campus activities. Rice is an active Alpha Phi Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. member and serves as the Advocate for Social Justice chair. She is also working as a civic fellow and is the co-lead for the Office of Leadership and Civic Engagement.  The political science student’s theme for her campaign was “The Game of Life,” with each platform point centered around the cards that come with the game and fully encircle her missions throughout the years.  “I wanted it to be a theme or campaign that would touch people regardless of race, gender, or sexuality,” Rice explained. “There are two sides that you can pick in The Game of Life: one is to have your career, and the other is to go to college. We all decided to go to college and ended up here at the same school, at the same time, and realized the importance of a degree for our careers.” Rice focuses on four initiatives with carefully crafted plans to accomplish each.    “I want N.C. A&T to be rooted in civic engagement,” Rice said. We were founded on the principles of civic engagement, governance, and advocacy, but sometimes I feel like they get lost.”    “A house is a safe space, and the safe space is rooted in SGA and advocacy,” she said.  One way Rice plans to accomplish this goal is by meeting students where they are and going to places like the library and cafe to make students comfortable with members of SGA.  “One thing I noticed when I was freshman class president is that people were logging onto Zoom to hear what we were saying during our meetings,” Rice stated. “I want that same accessibility.”     “It is about leaving the campus better than we found it,” Rice said. “Freshmen need to have resources that we did not have.” Rice is driven by her passion and advocacy. The newly elected president hopes that her campaign will be one that students can connect with and make a difference.  “Once it is all said and done, I want an administration that is personable, and everyone knows,” Rice said. “I want an inclusive administration where we are friends before business partners...",0

"What's Pi Day all about? Math, science, pies and more",2024-04-05T13:23:33+00:00,https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/303945-what-s-pi-day-all-about-math-science-pies-and-more,"Math enthusiasts around the world, from college kids to rocket scientists, celebrate Pi Day on Thursday, which is March 14 or 3/14 — the first three digits of an infinite number with many practical uses. Around the world many people will mark the day with a slice of pie — sweet, savory or even pizza. Simply put, Pi is a mathematical constant that expresses the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It is part of many formulas used in physics, astronomy, engineering and other fields, dating back thousands of years to ancient Egypt, Babylon and China. Pi Day itself dates to 1988, when physicist Larry Shaw began celebrations at the Exploratorium science museum in San Francisco. The holiday didn't really gain national recognition though until two decades later. In 2009, Congress designated every March 14 to be the big day — to hopefully spur more interest in math and science. Fittingly enough, the day is also Albert Einstein's birthday. Here's a little more about the holiday's origin and how it's celebrated today. WHAT IS PI? Pi can calculate the circumference of a circle by measuring the diameter — the distance straight across the circle's middle — and multiplying that by the 3.14-plus number. It is considered a constant number and it is also infinite, meaning it is mathematically irrational. Long before computers, historic scientists such as Isaac Newton spent many hours calculating decimal places by hand. Today, using sophisticated computers, researchers have come up with trillions of digits for pi, but there is no end. WHY IS IT CALLED PI? It wasn't given its name until 1706, when Welsh mathematician William Jones began using the Greek symbol for the number. Why that letter? It's the first Greek letter in the words ""periphery"" and ""perimeter,"" and pi is the ratio of a circle's periphery — or circumference — to its diameter. WHAT ARE SOME PRACTICAL USES? The number is key to accurately pointing an antenna toward a satellite. It helps figure out everything from the size of a massive cylinder needed in refinery equipment to the size of paper rolls used in printers. Pi is also useful in determining the necessary scale of a tank that serves heating and air conditioning systems in buildings of various sizes. NASA uses pi on a daily basis. It's key to calculating orbits, the positions of planets and other celestial bodies, elements of rocket propulsion, spacecraft communication and even the correct deployment of parachutes when a vehicle splashes down on Earth or lands on Mars. Using just nine digits of pi, scientists say it can calculate the Earth's circumference so accurately it only errs by about a quarter of an inch (0.6 centimeters) for every 25,000 miles (about 40,000 kilometers). IT'S NOT JUST MATH, THOUGH Every year the San Francisco museum that coined the holiday organizes events, including a parade around a circular plaque, called the Pi Shrine, 3.14 times — and then, of course, festivities with lots of pie. Around the country, man...",0

Dr. Phil insists new cable network is ‘consistent with family values’ — but not religious: ‘We need good common sense in this country’,2024-04-05T12:18:40+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/04/05/entertainment/dr-phil-details-merit-street-media-need-common-sense-in-country/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Dr. Phil McGraw has launched Merit Street Media, his new cable network, in a time where the fractured TV landscape makes it difficult to find a footing. But McGraw, 73 — who famously hosted “Dr. Phil” for 21 seasons — said he’s confident the new network, in partnership with Trinity Broadcasting Network, will resonate with viewers. “It’s something I wanted to do in terms of being able to get involved in the news cycle,” McGraw told The Post. “I’m not going to be a news anchor or anything, but I did want to have a news department where I could give people information about the news without so much spin. “You turn on Fox News and you hear all that and you turn on CNN and you hear the flip side. But it’s hard to get the straight and skinny and I think we’re going to endeavor to tell people what happened and let them make up their minds about whether it’s good or bad news. “This is a family-oriented network and I want it to be a destination network that you can turn on in the morning and leave on and not be worried about what your kids are going to see during the day,” he said. “We’re not a religious network, and we’re not pushing our values on anyone. But I do think we’re consistent with family values.” The 24/7 network’s lineup features a newsy morning show, “Morning on Merit Street” (8 p.m. to 10 p.m.), with the primetime lineup anchored by “Crime Stories with Nancy Grace” (6 p.m. to 7 p.m.), “The News on Merit Street” (7 p.m. to 8 p.m.) and McGraw’s new show, “Dr. Phil Primetime” (8 p.m. to 9 p.m.), which has a live studio audience a la “Dr. Phil.” “I want to talk about things that matter to viewers,” McGraw said. “I care about those things and they need to tell me what those things are — whether they’re moms, dads, husbands, wives, whatever. I really care about those issues and we’ve been really good [over the years] of listening and paying attention to what people are talking about.” Merit Street Media also features reruns of Steve Harvey’s NBC daytime talk show, “Steve”; McGraw and Harvey will appear together in a show in which they host a retreat in Georgia for young men growing up without fathers.  On the programming horizon is a new morning show helmed by former “Bachelor” host Chris Harrison and his wife, Lauren Zima. (Harrison is also working on a primetime dating show.) Other shows include “Bear Grylls: The Island,” “Somebody’s Gotta Do It” — with “Dirty Jobs” guy Mike Rowe — and the Sunday-morning “Scott Rasumussen Show,” hosted by the public opinion pollster. McGraw was particularly enthused about Merit Street’s show called “The Behavior Panel.” “I don’t know if you’ve ever run across them in their show on YouTube, but these guys are really great in interrogation and body language and stuff,” he said. “They’ve worked with homeland security, military law enforcement … different walks of life. “They’re great at getting t...",0

 Be prepared for some ridiculous essays to be graded A+. Reference: https://arstechnica.com/scienc... [arstechnica.com] My understanding is that the STAAR test merely suggests areas a student may need improvement in. If it's a rough guide to see who may need help rather than a direct tool to hold kids back a grade, maybe this is no big deal, especially if it's re-reviewed by a human reader IF a hold-back is initially recommended. As soon as the test results have teeth, parents will then wish to boot the bots. If it's a rough guide to see who may need help rather than a direct tool to hold kids back a grade, Does anybody hold kids back a grade anymore? Even when my kids were young it just wasn't done.
The (possibly correct) theory is that it makes more sense to start providing additional support and individualized instruction, rather than repeating a year of instruction that didn't work the first time around, along with all the personal upheaval and age mismatch that goes with it.

 The (possibly correct) theory is that it makes more sense to start providing additional support and individualized instruction, rather than repeating a year of instruction that didn't work the first time around, along with all the personal upheaval and age mismatch that goes with it. In my state they try to use summer school for that purpose. It's a hell of an incentive also: make the grades or have your summer ruined. When all the other kids are frolicking at pools and lakes, they are doing fractions in a smelly mobile classroom. Regardless of whether this particular case will cause harm, it is worrisome that so little information about the AI's effectiveness is being provided. If they were confident in the system they would be providing metrics on how often the AI matches the grades of human reviewers. They have millions of tests to verify the AI's competence with. When the AI provides a high confidence grade, does it match the grade of a human reviewer 99% of the time? 90% of the time? Then compare that with how many times the two  The STAAR test is mostly a feel good joke. Texas is pathologically averse to any kind of national standardized testing, since they tend to show Texas schools in an off-narrative and not very positive light   [ontocollege.com]. In theory kids who don't take, or flunk the STAAR tests on certain subjects cannot graduate from high school. I don't know how often this is really done, the high schools here seem to be doing everything possible to pass the trouble makers from grade to g...",0

Last month a Parentkid poll revealed that 58 per cent of parents believe the Government should introduce a ban on smartphones for under-16s. Another survey for More in Common put the figure at 64 per cent. The mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey has also called for smartphones to be made available for under-16s without social media apps. In January, Tory MP and former teacher Miriam Cates asked the Prime Minister to take the measure forward, noting that the UK 'has a strong tradition of legislating to protect children from serious threats to their safety and welfare.' A government spokesperson said: 'We do not comment on speculation. Our commitment to making the UK the safest place to be a child online is unwavering, as evidenced by our landmark Online Safety Act.'

A Government source said: 'There is increasing evidence that technology and social media is changing childhood. The Cass review shows that children's early exposure to pornography might be one of the things that is driving the rapid rise in children wanting to change gender.  'The Prime Minister's view is when it comes to our children, we should take a precautionary approach and be more vigilant than we would be with adults.' Ministers are considering banning mobile phone sales to children under 16 years old (Stock image) Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is 'forming views' about what he should do with his own children Last week the Prime Minister admitted his two daughters have smartphones - but warned parents about the dangers of social media. 'I talked to my wife about this a lot,' he told SunTV. 'And we're trying to juggle that like all parents are. I'm forming my views about what the right to do with my wife. Last month a Parentkid poll revealed that 58 per cent of parents believe the Government should introduce a ban on smartphones for under-16s. Another survey for More in Common put the figure at 64 per cent. The mother of murdered teenager Brianna Ghey has also called for smartphones to be made available for under-16s without social media apps. In January, Tory MP and former teacher Miriam Cates asked the Prime Minister to take the measure forward, noting that the UK 'has a strong tradition of legislating to protect children from serious threats to their safety and welfare.' A government spokesperson said: 'We do not comment on speculation. Our commitment to making the UK the safest place to be a child online is unwavering, as evidenced by our landmark Online Safety Act.'

Donate today. DeKALB – Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States, according to the CDC, but the real mastermind behind these cardiovascular diseases is blood clots. Jifu Tan, an assistant professor for the Department of Mechanical Engineering, is working on a five year project to change this issue. Tan recently received a Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) grant of $500,000 over five years from the National Science Foundation. The CAREER award is considered the most prestigious award presented by the NSF. The award is used to support junior faculty who represent the role of teacher-scholars through their research and education. Through his research, Tan hopes to explore the thrombus or blood clot formation process in humans by building a model to better understand the fluid mechanics and specific elements that cause clotting in order to predict and prevent clotting to prevent heart disease in patients. “Based on what we learn, you know, treat the circulating system as a mechanic system, how we can understand it, how we can provide a better prediction and treatment for the patients, that’s how I get involved, you know that’s where the inspiration come from,” Tan said. Tan employs his mechanical engineering knowledge through his interests in computational fluid dynamics and microfluidic application as he asks people to consider that the human body is just like a piping system. “As a mechanical engineer who is specialized in fluid mechanics, we study flow,” Tan said. “Then we can apply the fluid mechanics knowledge to understand why clots form.” Tan explains that just like a clog in a kitchen sink, blood clotting occurs when red blood cells, platelets or even fatty, cholesterol-containing deposits block arteries and stop blood from getting to vital parts of the body. “That clot will be made of red blood cells, platelets – it’s a small cell that is mainly responsible for stopping the bleeding – and they have some other cells, like white blood cells, could participate in the blood clotting,” Tan said. Unlike scientists who have solely researched clot formation, Tan’s research will work toward creating a computational model to fully imitate how clotting occurs by creating a digital and 3D printed model blood vessel. Red blood cells, which carry oxygen from the lungs and deliver it throughout the body, are around 1/10 of the thickness of a strand of hair, according to Tan. Platelets are a quarter of the size of a hair. With most arteries being only a few millimeters long, Tan will rely on NIU’s high performance computers to use a one dimensional equation for blood flow to calculate and test clotting scenarios.  The 3D printed large-scale model on the other hand will test those equations and try to imitate a human blood vessel as closely as possible, which includes blood, a beating h...",0

 Japan's science minister Masahito Moriyama said Tuesday he will travel to the United States to sign a deal later this week with NASA affirming Tokyo's cooperation on a U.S.-led lunar exploration program. The Artemis program aims to send U.S. astronauts to the lunar surface in 2026 for the first time in over half a century, and Moriyama and Bill Nelson, administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, are expected to agree on a deal that also includes two Japanese astronauts traveling to the moon. Their meeting comes as Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and U.S. President Joe Biden are scheduled to hold a summit in Washington on Wednesday. Additionally, Japan plans to provide a lunar rover for traveling the moon's surface that astronauts can drive without wearing a spacesuit and in which they can sleep. Toyota Motor Corp is spearheading its development. Japan will also transport supplies to Gateway, a lunar-orbiting outpost planned under the program. Besides returning humans to the moon and advancing lunar exploration, the ultimate goal of the Artemis program is to explore Mars.

When we travel, we may have a pleasant trip, where we meet new people and enjoy exciting adventures. We might also have a perilous journey of obstacles and ordeals. During our voyage, we might encounter a perfect storm or a dangerous reef that threatens to capsize us. Other times, we become lost and wander, or we may stumble down the wrong path. The 2021 American science fiction movie “Voyagers” superbly illustrates humans as voyagers in the universe. In 2063, as climate change ravages the Earth and turns it into an uninhabitable, barren planet, humans need to move to another world in order to survive. The surviving humans therefore decide to send a selected group of preteen astronauts under the supervision of an adult, chief officer Richard, to colonize a habitable exoplanet. Since the voyage takes about 86 years, the crew will only arrive at the exoplanet after three generations. After ten years of voyage in the spaceship “Humanitas,” Christopher and Zack find out that the “blue” beverage they drink daily contains a chemical that suppresses their sexual desires and pleasures. The original plan is to breed 30 egg and sperm cells repeatedly through IVF, that is, “in vitro fertilization” kept in isolation in the spaceship. Therefore, neither sexual intercourse nor childbirth is necessary for the young astronauts. Here looms the first theme of “Voyagers”: Is it all right to control and manipulate people if it is for a good cause? The chemical in the beverage has some positive effects, such as making the teenage crew stay calm and manageable. After they quit drinking the “blue” beverage, the teenagers become aggressive, impulsive and obsessive with their sexual urges due to their surging hormones. Yet, it does not seem to be right to suppress freedom or take away the pleasure of human beings even for a grand cause. The second outstanding theme of “Voyagers” is our responsibility for the future generation. The teenage crew of “Humanitas” have to spend their entire lives inside the spaceship in order to enable the next generation to settle down in the new habitable exoplanet. Therefore, sometimes they wonder...",0
TSMC Arizona to Build Fabs With Up to $6.6B in Proposed CHIPS & Science Act Funding,2024-04-09T20:30:50+00:00,https://executivegov.com/2024/04/tsmc-arizona-to-build-fabs-with-up-to-6-6b-in-proposed-chips-and-science-act-funding/,"Processing.... A subsidiary of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. could receive up to $6.6 billion in direct funding through the CHIPS and Science Act as part of a non-binding preliminary memorandum of terms signed with the U.S. Department of Commerce. TSMC Arizona plans to use the proposed direct funding to support the construction of three semiconductor fabs in Phoenix, the Commerce Department said Monday. The company plans to invest more than $65 billion in the three fabs. The first fab will manufacture 4-nanometer FinFET process technologies and the second chip factory will produce 2nm nanosheet process technology. The third fab will build 2nm or more advanced process technologies. TSMC Arizona expects to kick off high-volume production at the first fab by the first two quarters of 2025. “The leading-edge semiconductors that will be made here in Arizona are foundational to the technology that will define global economic and national security in the 21st century, including AI and high-performance computing,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. “Thanks to President Biden’s leadership and TSMC’s continued investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, this proposed funding would help make our supply chains more secure and create thousands of good-quality construction and manufacturing jobs for Arizonans,” added Raimondo. Under the nonbinding preliminary memorandum of terms, the company could receive another $50 million in funding to build its semiconductor and construction workforce and about $5 billion in proposed loans from the CHIPS Program Office. TSMC Arizona received support from the City of Phoenix to launch a Registered Apprenticeship program for semiconductor technicians.

Video Interview: Digital Science’s Stephen Leicht Talks AI Opportunities & Threats,2024-04-09T20:30:50+00:00,https://executivegov.com/2024/04/video-interview-digital-sciences-stephen-leicht-talks-ai-opportunities-and-threats/,"Processing.... In the age of artificial intelligence, new risks, opportunities, challenges and advancements are being unlocked every day. As government and industry leaders look toward an AI-enabled future, they’re taking great care to prepare for threats while driving technological innovation forward. Digital Science President Stephen Leicht spoke with Executive Mosaic’s video reporter Summer Myatt about the dangers and benefits of AI across a myriad of industries and applications. Stay up-to-date with the latest news and insights about AI at the Potomac Officers Club’s 5th Annual CIO Summit on April 17. Join us to hear panel discussions and keynote remarks focused on AI technologies and their applications within the government landscape. Register here. “AI can simulate really the better aspects of human intelligence,” he said in a new video interview. “And this is a major differentiator between what exists today and the traditional fixed computing infrastructure. These are systems that can learn, they can reason, they can improve, they can make decisions, they can solve problems. And perhaps one of the most obvious improvements that we saw in the gen AI revolution recently is that they can innovate and create things — so you see new solutions to complex problems, which are far beyond the traditional computing infrastructure.” Pentagon’s AI Friction Points While AI technology is advancing at a rapid pace, some larger organizations and agencies are finding it difficult to keep up. “I think the balance is we want to be faster, we want to be quick. This is an area where in two or three months time, the landscape is changing so dramatically that you have to put a really high emphasis on speed,” Leicht said. “At the same time, you’re in an area where you have to put a really large emphasis on being responsible and ethical. We’re talking about communities where moving quickly is hard. It’s hard to move quickly when you’re part of the defense infrastructure. It’s a big giant machine that turns slowly. So I think those are the friction points or the challenges,” he added. AI Opportunities Leicht emphasized that our innovation ecosystems in the U.S. are our advantage in the race towards AI dominance on the global stage. “I think one of the advantages we have from a U.S. defense perspective is that there are great opportunities for collaboration between our government organizations, our commercial organizations, and our universities, where a lot of this work goes on. So to the extent we can make those partnerships work, I think those are important,” said Leicht. For more insights from Stephen Leicht about the state of AI, watch his full video interview.

UK Nobel Prize-winning physicist Peter Higgs dies aged 94,2024-04-09T20:29:00+00:00,https://www.itnews.com.au/news/uk-nobel-prize-winning-physicist-peter-higgs-dies-aged-94-606868?utm_source=feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=iTnews+,"Physicist Peter Higgs, whose theory of an undetected particle in the universe changed science and was vindicated by a Nobel prize-winning discovery half a century later, has died aged 94, the University of Edinburgh said. The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the CERN research centre near Geneva was widely hailed as the biggest advance in knowledge about the cosmos for over 30 years, and pointed physics towards ideas that were once science fiction. ""For me personally it is just the confirmation of something I did 48 years ago, and it is very satisfying to be proved right in some way,"" the British scientist told Reuters at the time. ""At the beginning, I had no expectation that I would still be alive when it happened."" Edinburgh University, where Higgs held a professorial chair for many years, said he had passed away peacefully on Monday at home following a short illness. “Peter Higgs was a remarkable individual – a truly gifted scientist whose vision and imagination have enriched our knowledge of the world that surrounds us,"" said Professor Sir Peter Mathieson, the university principal and vice-chancellor. Higgs described himself as ""incompetent"" in the physics laboratory at school and at first preferred maths and chemistry. But inspired by quantum physicist Paul Dirac, who had attended the same school, he went on to specialise in theoretical physics. What came to be known as the Higgs boson would solve the riddle of where several fundamental particles get their mass from: by interacting with the invisible ""Higgs field"" that pervades space. That interaction, known as the ""Brout-Englert-Higgs"" mechanism, won Higgs and Belgium's Francois Englert the Nobel prize in physics in 2013. Englert's collaborator Robert Brout died in 2011. 'An incredible thing' In 1964, Higgs' first paper on the model was rejected by an academic physics journal at CERN as being ""of no relevance to physics"". His revised paper, although published weeks after Englert and Brout's, was the first to explicitly predict the existence of a new particle. ""Over a weekend ... I gradually realised that I knew two things that had to be brought together,"" he said. ""I had to go back to my office on the Monday and check that I hadn't made a mistake about this."" The tantalising vision promised to fill a gap in the ""Standard Model"" - the basic theoretical framework of physics - if only the particle's existence could be proven. For nearly three decades, physicists at CERN and at Fermilab in Chicago replicated the ""Big Bang"" by smashing particles together, hoping to glimpse the Higgs boson in the resulting mini-explosions. CERN's massive Large Hadron Collider finally proved to be the sledgehammer needed to crack the nut, and in 2012 two experiments there independently found the Higgs boson. Englert and Higgs were in the packed auditorium at CERN to hear the announcement of the discovery, while hundreds of thousands watched online.

                                                 2-time All-Star Ja Morant acted in self-defense during pickup game fight, judge says                                                  MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Ja Morant acted in self-defense when a teenager accused the two-time NBA All-Star of punching him during a pickup game at the home of the Memphis Grizzlies guard’s parents in 2022, a judge has ruled. Shelby County Court Circuit Judge Carol Chumney cited Tennessee law on when the issue of self-defense can be raised, and she wrote in a ruling issued Monday that Morant “enjoys a presumption of civil immunity.” The judge wrote that “a provocateur generally cannot invoke self-defense; if you start a fight, then you should be ready to finish it” under Tennessee law. She also noted the only provocateur in this situation was the plaintiff, Joshua Holloway, with everyone else just wanting to play basketball. Mike Miller, a former NBA player who was at the house when the fight occurred, testified that Holloway hitting Morant “in the face with a basketball ‘kind of started everything,’” the judge wrote in the ruling. Additional evidence backed up that claim, and none contradicted it, the judge wrote. The lawsuit filed by Holloway accuses Morant of assaulting him during a pickup game on July 26, 2022. Then 17, Holloway had been invited to play at the private full-sized court of the Morant family. Holloway now plays basketball for Samford. Morant claimed he was defending himself after Holloway aggressively threw the basketball at him with a one-handed, baseball-style pass that hit him in the face during a check-ball situation. A “check” is a common practice in pickup games in which two opposing players pass the ball to each other to see if their teammates are ready, often before starting a game or after a foul. Now 24, Morant testified during a December hearing that he was worried about getting hurt after the teen bumped him in the chest, balled his fists and got into a fighting stance before Morant punched Holloway. Morant’s childhood friend, Davonte Pack, also is a defendant in the lawsuit. Pack has acknowledged punching Holloway once and knocking him to the ground. Morant was not charged criminally, but Pack was charged with misdemeanor assault. That charge was later dismissed. The December hearing centered on Morant’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit under Tennessee’s so-called stand your ground law. The NBA player’s lawyers argued Morant is immune from liability under the law allowing people who feel threatened at their homes to act with force in certain situations. The law is used in criminal cases, but an earlier ruling by this same judge cleared the way for Morant’s lawyers to apply it in the civil case. The ruling also noted testimony that Holloway had been allowed inside the Morant home to watch TV, play video games or help himself to...",0

(Photo by Tom Brenner for The Washington Post via Getty Images) Special Counsel Jack Smith is once again politely tapping the horn in the direction of the Supreme Court, urging the justices to hurry up and rule on Trump’s immunity motion so he can be held accountable for interfering in the last election before running in the next one. “Consistent with the Court’s expedited treatment of this case, the government respectfully requests that the Court issue the opinion and a certified copy of the judgment forthwith,” the special counsel wrote at the end of the government’s brief. Indeed, Smith has been trying to get the Court to rule on Trump’s preposterous immunity claims since December, when he requested certiorari before judgment and expedited review. The justices refused, leaving the DC Circuit to bat around Trump’s counsel D. John Sauer like a chew toy at oral arguments. In the first few minutes, Judge Florence Pan forced the attorney to admit that, yes, he actually was suggesting that a sitting president could order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival and escape prosecution if he was not impeached for it and convicted in the Senate. The appellate opinion was both comprehensive and withering, and yet SCOTUS still felt the need to weigh in on the novel issue of “when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” On February 28, it granted cert with respect to the issue of “Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.” With argument set for April 25, it seems all but certain that the case will not go to trial before November. But that didn’t stop the prosecution from coming out swinging. “[T]his prosecution is a historical first not because of any assumption about immunity but instead because of the singular gravity of the alleged conduct,” he wrote in response to Trump’s claim that, because that no prior president has ever been criminally indicted, we must infer permanent immunity for ex-office holders. “The severity, range, and democracy-damaging nature of the alleged crimes are unique in American history,” he continued, noting inter alia that: (1) Ford pardoned Nixon, and Nixon accepted, because they both agreed that he faced criminal jeopardy; (2) the Impeachment Judgment Clause specifically contemplates the prosecution of ex-presidents; (3) the Office of Legal Counsel has repeatedly concluded that ex-presidents do not enjoy immunity for criminal prosecution; and (4) the logical conclusion of Trump’s reasoning would be to allow presidents to get away with “bribery, murder, treason, and sedition.” “The President’s constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed does not entail a general right to violate them,” the prosecutor fumed, adding that ...",0
"St. Lawrence College in Kingston, Ont. receives accreditation for degree in science nursing",2024-04-09T19:33:52+00:00,https://globalnews.ca/news/10412302/st-lawrence-college-science-nursing/,"Instructions: Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first. 
				If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.			 It may well be the first of its kind in Ontario, as the St. Lawrence College in Kingston welcomes the accreditation of its bachelor of science in nursing degree. The move to recognize the degree, by the Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing, was finalized on Monday, according to the college. In a media release, the college said such accreditation “solidifies (its) commitment to excellence in nursing education and ensures that its program meets rigorous standards of quality and effectiveness.” The process of accreditation for the standalone bachelor’s degree, according to associate dean Laralea Stalkie, began three years ago. “Three years ago, we were one of two colleges given the opportunity to provide nursing degree education at the college, instead of having a collaborative partnership with a university,” she said, noting that the recognition showcases the “quality of the nursing program” at the institution. “The accreditation actually shows the calibre of not only our program but the college that we offer it in, our students and our faculty.” Along with the bachelor’s program, the college offers a transitional program for practical nurses to earn their bachelor’s degree in science nursing. According to Stalkie, the school is seeking accreditation for that program as well. The email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.

                OXON HILL, Md. – The U.S. Navy’s Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) team gave visiting students a hands-on opportunities to connect STEM activities to real-world Navy missions during the Sea-Air-Space STEM Expo, Sunday. 

This year’s Expo placed sharp focus on the theme of Integrated Maritime Power—in other words, how the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard leverage complementary authorities and capabilities across warfare domains to advance the prosperity, security, and promise of a free and open, rules-based global order.

“The Sea-Air-Space Expo is an excellent opportunity for students to see STEM in action by seeing how many of the principles they learn are applied to Navy products,” said Dr. Greg Bouton, who leads SSP’s STEM education efforts, guiding programs at headquarters and around the nation. 

“Being represented at the STEM expo gives SSP a unique platform to market and brand the organization as an exciting place to work with a meaningful and very important mission.”

Volunteers from SSP—the Navy command that owns the cradle-to-grave responsibility for the submarine-launched ballistic missile system—had three demonstration stations available for expo attendees. Students were able to build and launch rockets using straws, clay, and index cards; inflate balloons and attach them to 3D printed rockets to watch them fly; and build structures using toothpicks, spaghetti noodles, and marshmallows. These learning activities represent baseline engineering competencies like building structurally sound shapes or understanding how various elements—like adding fins—can affect a rocket’s time and distance traveled. 

Testing these fundamentals relates to the real-world deterrence mission SSP serves—a mission that ties directly to the CNO’s “America’s Warfighting Navy” guidance and contributes to the Navy’s ability to “preserve the peace, respond in ...",0

					The source for greater Aurora, Colorado				  WASHINGTON |  Special counsel Jack Smith’s team urged the Supreme Court on Monday night to reject former President Donald Trump’s claim that he is immune from prosecution in a case charging him with scheming to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news The brief from prosecutors was submitted just over two weeks before the justices take up the legally untested question of whether an ex-president is shielded from criminal charges for official actions taken in the White House. “A President’s alleged criminal scheme to use his official powers to overturn the presidential election and thwart the peaceful transfer of power frustrates core constitutional provisions that protect democracy,” they wrote. The outcome of the April 25 arguments is expected to help determine whether Trump faces trial this year in a four-count indictment that accuses him of conspiring to block the peaceful transfer of power after losing the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has argued that former presidents enjoy immunity for official acts in office. Both the judge presiding over the case, Tanya Chutkan, and a three-judge federal appellate panel in Washington have forcefully rejected that claim.

The Supreme Court then said it would take up the question, injecting uncertainty into whether the case — one of four criminal prosecutions confronting Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president — can reach trial before November’s election. In their latest brief, Smith’s team rehashed many of the arguments that have prevailed in lower courts, pointedly noting that “federal criminal law applies to the president.” “The Framers never endorsed criminal immunity for a former President, and all Presidents from the Founding to the modern era ...",0

                ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. – Children and families enjoyed an evening of literature and fun, with lessons in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, creativity, and socializing during a Tell Me A Story event at the APG Youth Center April 4, 2024. The event helped kickoff APG’s Month of the Military Child celebration.   
The Military Child Education Coalition launched TMAS on Sept. 11, 2005, with the mission of empowering Military Children by using literature and their own stories in a way that fosters skills for resilience, strong peer and parent connections, a sense of pride and accomplishment, and a caring community, according to their site.
The APG Family Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Directorate hosted the event, which featured U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Chemical Biological Center (DEVCOM CBC) Director Michael Bailey, reading this year’s book “Ada Twist, Scientist” by author Andrea Beaty to APG children.
“Ada Twist, Scientist” is inspired by real-life makers Ada Lovelace and Marie Curie and champions STEM, girl power, and women scientists in a rollicking celebration of curiosity, the power of perseverance, and the importance of asking “Why?”
Various APG and community organizations were on hand for the event, providing children’s activities, including science and technology, spiritual and educational resources, engineering, military family life, and more.
APG Garrison Commander Col. Phil Mundweil, provided opening remarks sharing the significance of the event, families, military children, and the community.
“It is really encouraging to see this event taking place in April. It aligns with the overarching April theme – Month of the Military Child,” said Mundweil.
He continued to speak on the opportunities the event provides to further children’s curiosity and connectedness while encouraging parents to have good dialogue with their children. 
“Parents, my ask of you is to continue to read and discuss challenging topics with your kids,” said Mundweil. “Encourage them to ask questions the...",0

Museum of Science and Industry still mum on emergency closing prompted by moving 'military artifacts',2024-04-09T17:17:51+00:00,https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2024/04/09/museum-science-industry-msi-chicago-closed-military-artifacts-pentagon-secretary-state-bomb-squad,"The Museum of Science and Industry abruptly closed for a day last week to allow it to move “military artifacts from archival storage” — but still won’t say what those artifacts were or why “trained military personnel” were on hand. Sun-Times file photo ""Yet why not say what happened?""— Robert Lowell The tiniest detail can reveal something bad. A strangely-shaped freckle. The crack in the foundation, spreading. A small story popped up at the end of last week and was forgotten. The Museum of Science and Industry abruptly closed last Wednesday afternoon, sending visitors home ""as staff moves military artifacts from archival storage"" to allow a bit of ""unplanned maintenance."" ""Out of an abundance of caution, and to ensure proper and safe removal, we have specially trained military personnel as well as local officials on-site,"" the museum statement read. What does that mean?  ""Military artifacts?"" They aren't talking about old uniforms and mess kits. That has to be ... what? Hand grenades? Unexploded shells? What else requires ""specially trained military personnel"" to handle? You don't bring in the Army to remove a canteen. I waited for updates. Nothing.  Fine. I'm a reporter, I'll do it. I phoned and emailed Museum of Science and Industry spokesperson Kelsey Ryan.  Hours passed. I called its current president, Chevy Humphrey. When she arrived in 2021, the newspaper sent me to greet her with the big hurrah-for-Dr.-Humphrey profile. She had no trouble talking, then, about the new “Marvel: Universe of Super-Heroes” exhibit. Surely she'd explain what happened now. ""Chevy doesn't take phone calls,"" said the MSI receptionist. I waved the Sun-Times like a paper flag, and she put me through to her voicemail. Nothing. OK, work the other side of the story, the ""special trained military personnel"" and ""local officials."" Who could that be? I called the U.S. Army. It wasn't them. I put in the ritual calls to the Chicago police and fire departments — crickets chirping in a field. I texted Alexi Giannoulias, the Illinois secretary of state. His office has its own bomb squad. Giannoulias is old school, in that he still believes in an open democracy where information is freely shared. He got back immediately, reminding me that the world where we're heading — a world where major Chicago institutions abruptly eject visitors and shut their doors, calling in unspecified military units to cope with unnamed threats — is also a world where libraries that dare feature books about a penguin with two dads receive bomb threats. Twenty-two in Illinois last summer alone. He cited HB 4567, passed out of committee in the Illinois House of Representatives last Thursday, to better protect libraries against being silenced by people who, like the MSI, are allergic to the unfettered flow of information. “Our librarians and libraries have faced an onslaught of threats of violence and ideological intimidation for simply serving their communities,” said Giannoulias, who also serves as the ...",0

US historians file brief with supreme court rejecting Trump’s immunity claim,2024-04-09T16:40:40+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/09/trump-immunity-claim-historians,"Fifteen scholars on US history outline that Trump is not immune to prosecution for crimes committed while he was president Fifteen prominent historians filed an amicus brief with the US supreme court, rejecting Donald Trump’s claim in his federal election subversion case that he is immune to criminal prosecution for acts committed as president. Authorities cited in the document include the founders Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Adams, in addition to the historians’ own work. Trump, the historians said, “asserts that a doctrine of permanent immunity from criminal liability for a president’s official acts, while not expressly provided by the constitution, must be inferred. To justify this radical assertion, he contends that the original meaning of the constitution demands it. But no plausible historical case supports his claim.” Trump faces four federal election subversion charges, arising from his attempt to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden in 2020, fueled by his lie about electoral fraud and culminating in the deadly attack on Congress of 6 January 2021. He also faces 10 election subversion charges in Georgia, 34 charges over hush-money payments in New York, 40 federal charges for retaining classified information, and multimillion-dollar penalties in civil cases over tax fraud and defamation, the latter arising from a rape allegation a judge called “substantially true”. Despite such unprecedented legal jeopardy, Trump strolled to the Republican nomination to face Biden in November and is seeking to delay all cases until after that election, so that he might dismiss them if he returns to power. His first criminal trial, in the New York hush-money case, is scheduled to begin next Monday. Despite widespread legal and historical opinion that Trump’s immunity claim is groundless, the US supreme court, to which Trump appointed three justices, will consider the claim. Oral arguments are scheduled for 25 April. The court recently dismissed attempts, supported by leading historians, to remove Trump from ballots under the 14th amendment, passed after the civil war to bar insurrectionists from office. In a filing on Monday, the special counsel Jack Smith urged the justices to reject Trump’s immunity claim as “an unprecedented assault on the structure of our government”. Seven of the 15 historians who filed the amicus brief are members of the Historians Council on the Constitution at the Brennan Center for Justice, a progressive policy institute at New York University law school. Holly Brewer, a professor of American cultural and intellectual history at the University of Maryland, said: “When designing the presidency, the founders wanted no part of the immunity from criminal prosecution claimed by English kings.
