			Trending:		 According to the Red Cross, every two seconds, someone in the United States needs blood. In an effort to combat this ever-growing need, the Vallejo Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. is hosting a community blood drive on Jan. 16, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., at the Solano County Fairgrounds. This will mark the second year the Vallejo Alumnae Chapter and the Red Cross have partnered to host a community blood drive to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. In a press release for the drive, Dr. Dela Morris, President of the Chapter announced, “The Vallejo Alumnae Chapter is committed to strengthening our community and helping meet hospital and patient needs through blood donations.” “This blood drive is our way to help save lives,” Morris said. Despite the overwhelming need for blood, only 3 percent of the U.S. population donates. By rolling up a sleeve, donors can play a critical role in accidents and burn victims, heart surgery and organ transplant patients, and those receiving treatment for leukemia, cancer or sickle cell disease. Volunteer blood donors are the only source for the perishable product, which is in constant need of replenishment, according to the Red Cross. In particular, the Red Cross has outlined a crucial need for Black donors to give blood. According to the Red Cross, donors with all blood types are needed, especially those with types O negative, A negative and B negative. “We urge community members to donate blood and help ensure that patients in local hospitals have a blood supply ready and waiting before an emergency occurs,” the Red Cross said. “There’s no better feeling than knowing that your blood donation may give someone a second chance at life.” Chartered in 1974, the Vallejo Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. has proved its enduring commitment to public service programs and activities. For 50 years, the women of Vallejo Alumnae Chapter have continued to organize and implement innovative programs that positively impact and transform the diverse Vallejo community. Comprised of predominantly Black, college-educated women, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. is committed to the development of its members and to public service with a primary focus on the Black community. The private, non-profit organization was founded with a purpose to provide assistance and support through established programs in local communities worldwide. Since its founding, more than 300,000 women have joined the organization, with 1,000 collegiate and alumnae chapters in the United States, Canada, Japan (Tokyo and Okinawa), Germany, the Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and the Republic of Korea. The blood drive will take place at Solano Race Place, 900 Fairgrounds Drive, Vallejo.

Ticker: Microsoft passes Apple as most valuable stock; Supreme Court agrees to hear Starbucks appeal,2024-01-14T20:30:07+00:00,https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/01/14/ticker-microsoft-passes-apple-as-most-valuable-stock-supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-starbucks-appeal/,"E-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters E-Edition 
			Trending:		 Microsoft Corp. overtook Apple Inc. to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company for the first time in more than two years, as worries over smartphone demand have weighed on the iPhone-maker’s stock in recent weeks. The Redmond, Washington-based software giant rose 1% to $388.47 on Friday, ending with a market valuation of $2.89 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple gained 0.2% and closed with a market capitalization of $2.87 trillion. It’s the first time since November 2021 that Microsoft has closed with a higher value than Apple. “When you compare and contrast the two, the growth Apple is showing is nothing special, whereas Microsoft has done a better job of executing and demonstrating earnings growth,” said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. “Microsoft also has a much clearer roadmap with AI, and it has done a great job articulating how that will accelerate growth to make its long-term prospects even more compelling.” The Supreme Court has agreed to hear an appeal from Starbucks in a dispute with the National Labor Relations Board over efforts by workers to unionize at a store in Memphis, Tennessee. The case has been among the most closely watched in the more than 2-year-old effort to unionize Starbucks’ company-owned U.S. stores. Starbucks fired seven employees in Memphis in February 2022, citing safety. The Seattle coffee giant said they violated company policy by reopening a store after closing time and inviting non-employees — including a television crew — to come inside and move throughout the store. But the NLRB intervened, saying the company was unlawfully interfering in workers’ right to organize and that the store had routinely allowed employees to gather there after closing time.

"Kekin kum ubijen iz snajpera na sahrani: Upucan u grudi naočigled dečaka, čekala ga i ekipa sa kalašnjikovima",2024-01-14T19:51:00+00:00,https://www.telegraf.rs/vesti/hronika/3815912-kekin-kum-ubijen-iz-snajpera-na-sahrani-upucan-u-grudi-naocigled-decaka-cekala-ga-i-ekipa-sa-kalasnjikovima,"Vreme čitanja: oko 4 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 4 min. Milomir Jovanović (46) iz Vranića, kum vođe novobeogradskog kriminalnog klana Dejana Stojanovića Keke, ubijen je na današnji datum 2017. godine na parkingu groblja u Sopotu, gde je bio na sahrani. Sarhana se završila, ljudi su u tišini napuštali groblje, ali neko je čekao baš Jovanovića. Oko 14 sati, kada je krenuo ka svom automobilu, pao je kao pokošen jer je bio pogođen u grudi hicima iz snajpera. Njegovo obezbeđenje ga je odmah nakon pucnjave smestilo u automobil i odvezli su ga u Dom zdravlja u Sopotu, gde je preminuo. Automobil ubice je najverovatnije bio parkiran na oko 100 metara vazdušnom linijom u odnosu na Jovanovićev džip. Pretpostavlja se da je ubica čekao baš trenutak da Jovanović otvori zadnja vrata automobila jer mu je tada bio na čistoj liniji. Precizno je ispalio četiri hica sa obližnjeg brda. - U šoku smo i ne možemo da verujemo da se ispred naše kuće dogodilo ubistvo. Moj šesnaestogodišnji sin bio je na samo pet metara od mesta na kom se nalazio ubijeni. Čuo je neki pucanj, ali je mislio da su petarde u pitanju. Dete je prišlo da pomogne misleći da je čovek pao zbog leda. Video je da mu curi krv iz usta i pritekao u pomoć, a u tom trenutku, trojica muškaraca koja su se nalazila u automobilu, izašla su i verbalno napala njega, upitavši ga šta je to uradio - rekao je u vreme ubistva meštanin Sopota, ispred čijeg doma se dogodila likvidacija. To su pretpostavili i prijatelji ubijenog Milomira. Kada su videli Jovanovića da leži krvav, nisu znali zašto je pao, pa su posumnjali da je dete nešto skrivilo. - Dečak ide u školu u Valjevu. Došao je na vikend i u trenutku ubistva je bio sam kod kuće. Izašao je da donese drva i video kako čovek mrtav pada. To je velika trauma za njega, da bude svedok ubistvu - rekao je tada otac dečaka. Motiv likvidacije najverovatnije su bili nerašćišćeni računi u poslovima sa narkoticima. Jovanovićev brat Milan nestao je u Češkoj oko šest meseci pre nego što je Jovanović ubijen, a on je od tada pojačao svoje obezbeđenje i svuda je išao u pratnji telohranitelja. To ubistvo dovođeno je u vezu sa ubistvom Vladimira Bjelanovića (35) koje se u decembru 2005. godine dogodilo na Vračaru. Obojica su, prema policijskim saznanjima, bili u poslovima sa narkoticima, ali i u međusobnom sukobu. Policija nije odbacila ni veziju po kojoj je Jovanović ubijen u sukobu sa suparničkom beogradskom ekipom. Ipak, i tu se pojavljuje smrt Bjelanovića, kao jedan od glavnih razloga za organizovanje zločina. Verovalo se da je eventualni atentator neko od ""domaćih"" koji je znao da će žrtva otići na grob prijatelju, odnosno bio je upoznat sa okolinom i time odakle bi mogao neopaženo da puca. Navodno su za Jovanovićevu likvidaciju bile pripremljene dve ekipe egzekutora. U slučaju da snajperista iz nekog razloga nije završio posao, Jovanovića su nedaleko od stana čekale ubice sa ""kalašnjikovima"". Kako se sumnjalo, oni su bili u ""šteku"" i samo čekali znak da zapucaju. Jedna od sumnji je...",0

TKO Group Holdings Inc., which houses WWE and UFC, said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday that the agreement is for 10 years, with Netflix having an option to extend the deal for an additional 10 years. There’s also an opt out available to Netflix after the initial five years. “Raw,” which debuted in 1993, has produced 1,600 episodes to date and features wrestlers such as Cody Rhodes, Becky Lynch, Seth Rollins and Rhea Ripley. The three-hour program currently airs on USA Network and its media rights were considered a hot commodity over the past several months, particularly after the WWE return of CM Punk in November, with many speculating it could land at any number of networks or streaming platforms. “We are excited to have WWE Raw, with its huge and passionate multigenerational fan base, on Netflix,” Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria said in a prepared statement. WWE said Tuesday that “Raw” will air on Netflix starting in January 2025. This will impact viewers in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Latin America and other territories. WWE said that it will also impact additional countries and regions over time. “This deal is transformative,” Mark Shapiro, TKO president and COO, said in a prepared statement. “It marries the can’t-miss WWE product with Netflix’s extraordinary global reach and locks in significant and predictable economics for many years. Our partnership fundamentally alters and strengthens the media landscape, dramatically expands the reach of WWE, and brings weekly live appointment viewing to Netflix.” WWE also said that its documentaries, original series and forthcoming projects will be available on Netflix internationally starting in 2025. The move of “Raw” to Netflix follows the announcement in September by World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. that “Friday Night Smackdown,” would be moving from Fox to USA Network in 2024 under a new five-year domestic media rights partnership with NBCUniversal. As part of the agreement, WWE will also produce four prime-time specials per year that will air on NBC, starting in the 2024/2025 season. This will be the first time that WWE will air on the network in prime time. Speaking on CNBC, TKO CEO Ariel Emanuel said that he didn’t believe there’s a move away from traditional television networks or cable networks, but that streaming platforms were becoming another option, as seen through its “Raw” deal with Netflix. “This is the streaming play. For us, it’s the next step,” he said. WWE also announced Tuesday that it reached a deal with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson that will give the star the rights to his nickname. Johnson will also join the board of TKO Group. Shares of TKO Group jumped more than 19% in early trading.

Working together, the parties have developed plans to build out the dessert café this year.  “Choosing Gilroy for our coffee shop is a heartfelt decision,” said Luis Rodriquez, owner of Delicias Mi Ocampo. “This welcoming community embraced me when I arrived, and now, I chose Gilroy as a thank-you to its beautiful community and wish to create a warm and inviting space where people can savor recipes that have been cherished in my family for over 80 years.” 7573 Monterey, which previously housed Clocks & Collectibles, will undergo a transformation during the build-out. Backing up to Gourmet Alley, it will provide outdoor party seating accessible by pedestrians. The store front will be completely replaced with outdoor seating available on the sidewalk. The interior will also be updated with the addition of new services to bring the building up to code.  “I feel the landlord and tenant relationship is a partnership,” Modi said. “If trust develops then there is a potential for growth. I am excited about this partnership and our upcoming endeavors.” Delicias Mi Ocampo is a popular vendor in Gilroy Downtown Business Association events.

"Ovo je prava emocija: Devojčica upoznala i zagrlila Džejmsa Nanelija, pa briznula u plač!",2024-01-24T23:37:50+00:00,https://www.telegraf.rs/sport/evroliga-kosarka/veciti/3824390-ovo-je-prava-emocija-devojcica-upoznala-i-zagrlila-dzejmsa-nanelija-pa-briznula-u-plac,"Vreme čitanja: oko 1 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 1 min. Košarkaš Partizana Džejms Naneli bio je gost svog kluba, koji je organizovao druženje sa njima u klupskom šopu u ulici Kralja Milutina, gde je bilo na stotine mališana koji su želeli da se upoznaju i slikaju sa svojim igračem. Druženje je bilo predviđeno da traje oko jedan sat, međutim, zbog ogromne gužve i velikog broja dece, produženo je na dva i po sata, a Naneli je ostao sve dok nije ispunio i poslednji zahtev za potpis ili fotografiju. Tokom slikanja, zabeležen je i jedan prelepi snimak, gde je akter bila jedna devojčica. Naime, ona je tražila od Nanelija sliku, što je igrač prihvatio, potom ju je i zagrlio, da bi ona briznula u plač čim se od njega okrenula. Savladale su emocije ovu devojčicu koja je upoznala svog heroja. Kako je to sve izgledalo možete pogledati u videu u nastavku teksta.

			Trending:		 BOULDER — The former Colorado Athletic Club in central Boulder will be renovated and will reopen as Life Time Fitness next year, according to Macerich Inc. (NYSE: MAC), the gym’s landlord. The 40,000-square-foot Twenty Ninth Street Mall-area gym will represent Life Time Group Holdings Inc.’s (NYSE: LTH) fourth lease at a Macerich property. The 1821 30th St. location in Boulder will be Life Time’s first operation in Boulder. “Our full transformation at Twenty Ninth Street will bring new energy and excitement as the premier luxury athletic and social club in Boulder,” Life Time president of club operations Parham Javaheri said in a prepared statement. “Our ongoing collaboration with Macerich has proven to be successful for both entities as we continue to bring the Life Time brand to highly desirable locations as part of our asset-light strategy.” Colorado Athletic Club owner The Wellbridge Co. closed several Colorado gyms in late 2023, including the Boulder fitness center, which shuttered at the end of last October. “We are proud to have helped so many individuals begin their fitness journey and then watch them make it a routine,” Wellbridge posted on the Boulder gym’s website. “They became regulars and more than just a member – they became our friends. Boulder is considered to be one of the fittest cities in America, and the Club and its loyal teammates have been honored to have supported that lifestyle for more than a decade.” This article was first published by BizWest, an independent news organization, and is published under a license agreement. © 2024 BizWest Media LLC.

2024 Mushroom Festival coming to downtown Morgan Hill,2024-01-26T22:29:32+00:00,https://morganhilltimes.com/2024-mushroom-festival-coming-to-downtown-morgan-hill/,"Event is confirmed for May 25-26 with new security contractor  The 43rd Morgan Hill Mushroom Festival, formerly known as Mushroom Mardi Gras, will take place May 25-26 in the city’s downtown, organizers announced on Jan. 25.  The board of directors of Morgan Hill Mushroom Mardi Gras, Inc.—the organization that runs the festival—was “excited” this week to announce they have received approval from the City of Morgan Hill and the Morgan Hill Police Department to move forward with the event, says the press release from MHMMG.  Last year’s attempt to hold the popular local event was nixed after a security contractor hired by the festival terminated their agreement with organizers. Instead, MHMMG hosted a concert fundraiser, known as the Morgan Hill Mushroom Benefit Concert, that raised enough money to provide $10,000 in scholarships this year for local students.  The Mushroom Festival was also canceled in 2020 and 2021 due to concerns related to the pandemic, but it returned to its downtown Morgan Hill location—centering around the Community and Cultural Center—in 2022.  This year, MHMMG Board President Dan Keith and Director Sunday Minnich began planning early with city officials, city staff and MHPD “to guarantee this year’s festival will take place,” says the press release. The organization has also been working closely with its newly hired security company, Interpol Private Security, to proceed with planning for the May 25-26 event.  “The main focus of MHMMG is to provide a fun and entertaining family festival to raise money to award scholarships to high school seniors living within the boundaries of the Morgan Hill Unified School District,” says the press release.   Scholarships are typically based on the net revenue of the previous year’s festival, organizers said. The proceeds from the 2023 Benefit Concert largely came from sponsors who had pledged to support the Mushroom Festival before it was canceled.  MHMMG this year also plans to continue to donate funds and support to school groups and clubs, youth sports and nonprofit organizations that work at the festival, says the press release.  Over the last 42-plus years, the festival has awarded about $1.5 million in scholarships and more than $550,000 to local nonprofits, school groups and youth sports.  Visitors to this year’s festival will enjoy shopping at more than 145 arts and crafts and retail booths; gourmet food vendors, many producing mushroom inspired dishes; beer and wine gardens; live music performances on two stages, including the CCC amphitheater; chef demonstrations; a mushroom expo; and strolling entertainment.  The festival’s Mushroom Exhibition will offer chef demonstrations, vendors and educational exhibits focusing on the fungi that have made Morgan Hill the Mushroom Capital of the Western U.S., says the press release.  This year’s entertainment lineup includes “Hotel California, Eagles Original Tribute Band” as well as San Francisco dance and party band “The Party Starters.” ...",0

‘Champion’ review: Lyric Opera’s jazz-flavored boxing bio lands most of its punches,2024-01-28T22:38:02+00:00,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/1/28/24053555/champion-review-lyric-opera-chicago-terence-blanchard-emile-griffith-reginald-smith-justin-austin,"Boxer Emile Griffith (Justin Austin, center) tries to make sense of his knockout of Benny “Kid” Paret (Sankara Harouna) in Lyric Opera’s production of “Champion.” Michael Brosilow When Lyric Opera of Chicago presented the 2022 regional premiere of Terence Blanchard’s “Fire Shut Up in My Bones,” an adaptation based on the best-selling memoir of New York Times columnist Charles M. Blow, it immediately reinforced the jazz great’s fast-growing standing as an important operatic force. It was little surprise, then, that the company, in what was a very quick pivot in the usually slow-moving operatic world, has offered a follow-up: Blanchard’s first opera, “Champion,” which the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis debuted in 2013. The co-production with New York’s Metropolitan Opera opened Saturday and runs through Feb. 11. Often moving and ultimately redemptive, “Champion” explores fleeting fame, inner demons and unrelenting guilt. It is a tough, raw story that pulls no punches with its use of the f-word and other adult language not normally heard in operas.  A kind of operatic version of a biopic, as “Fire” is, this story is based on the life of Emile Griffith (1938-2013), a boxer from the U.S. Virgin Islands who won world titles in three weight divisions and is a member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Griffith’s most famous or infamous title bout came in 1962 when he knocked out Benny “Kid” Paret, who never recovered consciousness and died 10 days later. During a weigh-in for the fight, Paret touched Griffith on the buttocks and taunted him with anti-gay slurs. That harrowing bout, which culminates Act 1, is the dramatic focal point of this opera along with the bisexual boxer’s struggles with male identity in the  macho world of boxing. “What makes a man a man?” he asks in a probing aria.  Griffith later suffered from “boxer’s dementia,” and the opera takes place in the early 2000s, with the aging boxer looking back and reliving highlights of his life as he prepares to meet Paret’s son, Benny Paret Jr.  There is much to like about this opera, especially Blanchard’s highly effective score, but the libretto by actor and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Michael Cristofer is arguably not as well-integrated or well-constructed dramatically as that in “Fire.” Some of the story’s exposition in Act 1 seems labored and overdone, while the exploration of Griffith’s gay identity, essentially two quick bar scenes, comes off as superficial, and the scene in which he meets Sadie Donastorg (soprano Meroë Khalia Adeeb) and decides to marry her is bafflingly fast and shallow. What does work well is the creative interplay between the “old” and “young” versions of Griffith (really two voices in the aging fighter’s mind) who are seen often together onstage, and the use of an old-fashioned boxing ring announcer (the wonderful Chicago actor Larry Yando) as a kind of narrator with sometimes comic-tinged patter.  James Robinson, who also directed “Fire,” is back for “Cham...",0

Naeem Shah, the project manager of the Choola Initiative, communicated the Heritage Foundation’s successful track record in community and environmental projects since 1984. He highlighted the unique and successful aspects of the Choola project, including its efficiency, safety, flood adaptability, and its role as a communal space for family activities.

During the programme, attendees raised various questions about the efficiency of metallic stoves and the availability of Heritage stoves to the wider community. The sponsors emphasized that all efficient stoves are welcome, but the unique self-maintainable aspect of the Heritage stoves, crafted by women themselves, sets them apart. A community trainer shared the positive impact of the stoves. Highlighting reduced wood usage, time-saving, and strengthened family bonds. She said, “The new stoves, built by women has a lot of benefits as it reduces the wood requirements, second th...",0

Košarkaši Crvene zvezde i Partizana večeras u ""Štark Areni"" igraju novi večiti derbi u okviru ABA lige, a pred meč su o dva rivala razgovarali i poznati treneri na TV Arena Sport, među kojima je bio i iskusni Vlade Đurović. On je analizirao igru oba tima, a između ostalog se dotakao i centara Partizana. Pre svega je prokomentarisao igru Frenka Kaminskog, a onda se osvrnuo na važnost koju ima Alen Smailagić za tim crno-belih. - Kaminski kad bi igrao za Igokeu, Borac, dao bi po 30 poena, a ovde se traže mišići, skok, bananu da lupiš, a on to ne može. Ne vidim prednost Partizana na centrima, tu Smailagić najviše radi. On skače, on se bori, on udara, on pali publiku, on ponekad i zakuca. Bez njega Partizan ne može, meni je on važniji od Ledeja - rekao je poznati trener. (Telegraf.rs) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona +381

Monterey caterer charged with defrauding government of $4M,2024-01-29T22:56:38+00:00,https://www.montereyherald.com/2024/01/29/monterey-caterer-charged-with-defrauding-government-of-4m/,"e-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters e-Edition 
			Trending:		 MONTEREY – Monterey caterer Dory Lindsay Ford has been charged with defrauding the government out of $4 million in COVID-relief funds the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Northern California District announced. A federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Ford with various crimes including bank fraud, three counts of wire fraud, and two counts of money laundering, according to a press release from the Northern District of California. Ford, 57, of Monterey, operated Aqua Terra Culinary, Inc., a catering company in Pacific Grove he launched in 2010. Before starting Aqua Terra, Ford was the executive chef at Ventana Inn & Spa in Big Sur, as well as at the Portola Cafe at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. During the pandemic, Ford applied for and received loans and grants from the Paycheck Protection Program, the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, totaling about $4 million. The indictment says Ford obtained the funds by using false and fraudulent representations, promises and omissions, and concealed material facts. It alleges that Ford used the COVID-19 loan and grant money to purchase real estate properties in the country of Belize, to invest in the stock market, and to fund a different business venture instead of using the loan money for proper expenses, such as payroll costs, rent or mortgage payments, and supplies. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was a federal law enacted in or around March 2020, when the pandemic was taking off, and designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans suffering the economic effects of the crisis. A source of relief from the CARES Act was the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the Payroll Protection Program. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 established the Restaurant Revitalization Fund appropriating $28.6 billion to the Small Business Administration for making grants. The SBA awarded funding through the RRF to restaurants, bars, and similar businesses serving food and drink, according to the release. The purpose of the funding was to provide support to eligible entities that suffered revenue losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation resources. The Economic Injury Disaster Loan program is a Small Business Administration program that provided low-interest financing to small businesses, renters, and homeowners in regions affected by declared disasters. An indictment alleges that crimes have been committed, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, says the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Northern California District. If convicted, Ford faces a maximum statutory sentence of 30 years in prison and a maximum statutory fine of $1 million for bank fraud, a maximum statutory sentence of...",0

AFWERX, the innovation arm of the Department of the Air Force, has awarded Xwing two Small Business Innovation Research contracts, a Phase Two in March 2023 to conduct autonomous flight trials and optimize the technology for future missions and a Phase Three in December 2023 to demonstrate the capability in an operationally relevant environment. Xwing's autonomous flight technology allows its aircraft to taxi, takeoff, fly to a destination, avoid airborne and ground threats, and land, without any human input.

                SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AFRL) – AFWERX Autonomy Prime partner Xwing Inc. successfully completed an autonomous logistics mission in its Cessna 208B as dozens of Airmen watched from a ground control station at McClellan Airfield in Sacramento, California, Jan. 26, 2024. Xwing's autonomous flight technology allows its aircraft to taxi, take off, fly to a destination, avoid airborne and ground obstacles, and land, without any human input.

“To see an aircraft takeoff, fly and land by itself, was fascinating to see,” said Maj. Thomas Davis, Pacific Air Forces Future Capabilities branch chief.

Airmen arrived at the ground control station around 9 a.m. and were briefed by Xwing employees about their capabilities as they watched a live feed of the Cessna performing autonomous takeoffs and landings at the Yolo County Airport in Davis, California. The demonstration quickly turned into an opportunity for Xwing to showcase its capabilities in a representative operational environment. Air Force operational leaders asked if the Xwing aircraft could pick up cargo at March Air Reserve Base, California and deliver it to McClellan Airfield instead of using traditional heavy-lift aircraft.

“Demonstrating the capability in an operationally relevant environment is a technical milestone in a capability’s technical readiness and we wanted to check that box,” said Ian Clowes, AFWERX Prime stakeholder engagement lead. “And to get that opportunity when we only planned on a demonstration was a win for AFWERX and the Air Force.” 

Autonomy Prime is the newest technology program in Prime, a division within AFWERX, and is focused on the development and implementation of emerging autonomous technologies. Similar to other Prime programs, Autonomy Prime partners with the private sector to accelerate testing and affordably deliver game-changing tec...",0

Replika’s new AI therapy app tries to bring you to a zen island,2024-01-30T23:32:18+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/30/24056106/tomo-replika-blush-generative-ai-mental-health,"By  Emilia David, a reporter who covers AI. Prior to joining The Verge, she covered the intersection between technology, finance, and the economy. AI companion company Replika partnered with the team behind the AI dating simulator Blush to release Tomo, a wellness and meditation app with an AI-generated avatar guiding users. Its the kind of concept that seemed destined as soon as generative AI took off, but in the time I’ve spent with Tomo, I found myself wondering if I can ever open up to an AI like I can with a real therapist. Tomo, now generally available on the Apple iOS store, brings users to a virtual island retreat, greeted by an AI-generated avatar guide named… Tomo. Tomo offers programs to help people explore personal growth, mental well-being, and fulfillment. It also provides guided meditation, yoga, affirmation classes, and, most of all, talk therapy.  Users can try out Tomo for free for three days, after which they have to choose between paying $7.99 a week or $49.99 per year.  I got to try Tomo before the launch. The first time I launched the app, I was greeted by spa music, signaling that the app wants users to feel like they’re in a retreat rather than a therapist’s office. Then the avatar Tomo, drawn as a young woman standing in front of a traditional Japanese house on an island, asks me if I’m ready to begin. Tomo started asking me some questions to figure out what I hoped to work on.  “We worked with coaches and psychologists to come up with the programs for Tomo. We focused on the most common problems but also thought about what would work best with conversational AI,” Eugenia Kuyda, founder and CEO of Replika, tells The Verge in an email. “We had a lot of experience building coaching programs for Replika with clinical psychologists from UC Berkeley; for Tomo, we expanded that to mindfulness teachers to combine Eastern and Western practices.” The approach felt like texting a therapist on text-based therapy services like BetterHelp. I already go to in-person therapy, so the experience of sharing more about myself was not new. Yet I have never been a text therapy fan; I prefer stream-of-consciousness conversation to typing out my anxieties. But for the sake of a hands-on, I kept texting with Tomo. It began building a profile based on my answers. My profile shows I like to focus on work, have money anxieties, and need help coping with stress; in other words, a journalist existing in late-stage capitalism. Tomo summarized our conversation, but it did mistakenly assume I had a “determination to pursue pottery” when really I’m just curious about it as a possible stress reliever. After the initial conversation, users can explore other activities or “areas” of the island. There was no virtual pottery for me to apparently pursue; instead, the programs Tomo offers range from mastering the art of work-life balance, driving motivation, and improving sleep, which comes in the form of modules that users can finish in anywhere from two weeks...",0

Zodiac Gold Announces Commencement of Trading and Introduces Executive Team & Exploration Plans,2024-01-31T23:35:11+00:00,https://investingnews.com/zodiac-gold-announces-commencement-of-trading-and-introduces-executive-team-exploration-plans/,"Zodiac Gold Inc. (“Zodiac Gold” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that the Company has commenced trading on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol (TSX-V:ZAU). Zodiac Gold is also pleased to introduce the Company’s executive team and upcoming exploration plans.  Company Overview: Zodiac Gold is at the forefront of gold exploration in West Africa, showcasing significant exploration potential at its 100% owned Todi Project, located in the Republic of Liberia. The Todi Project encompasses a 2,316 km2 land package that includes geology and structures known to host gold mineralization, situated in a previously underexplored region of West Africa. Management lives and operates on the ground in Liberia with 24 years of West African experience. The Company has strong government and political knowhow and there is a significant U.S. Government presence in Liberia.  Key Highlights: The Todi Project: The Todi Project is the cornerstone of Zodiac Gold's exploration endeavors in the prolific Todi Shear Zone of Central Liberia. Positioned within the West African Craton, one of the world’s great gold provinces and the largest Paleoproterozoic gold-producing region hosting numerous world-class gold deposits with an estimated gold endowment of over 450 Moz2, Zodiac Gold believes that the Todi Project offers a compelling investment proposition. The Todi Project contains numerous prospects, targets and anomalies distributed throughout the land package. These include conceptual geology targets based on known settings of existing greenstone belts, cross cutting shear zones, coherent gold in soil anomalies, stream sediment geochemistry and geophysical discontinuities and anomalies. Additionally, existing artisanal mining sites are assumed to be located on structural trends that continue onto and through the land package forming highly prospective targets for the discovery of significant gold deposits. For further details regarding the Todi Project, refer to the technical report prepared by ACA Howe titled “Technical Report on the Todi Gold Project in Liberia” and dated November 14, 2023, a copy of which is available under Zodiac Gold’s SEDAR profile at www.sedarplus.com. Exploration Plans: Phase 2 Drill Program: A 500 m drilling campaign was completed in 2023 as part of the ongoing Phase 2 Drill Program, primarily focusing on the Arthington target. The campaign aimed to test and extend the mineralization along a 2,400 m strike of the +4km mineralized trend identified by the soil anomalies, trenching and high-grade channel chip samples on the bedrock where the shear zones exposed visible gold. The current drill program will serve as a basis for the next stage of extensive drilling program planned at Arthington with the objected of delineating a maiden resource at the property. Zodiac Gold also intends to expand its drilling on other targets at the Todi Project. The Alasala target, with a +2 km strike length of mineralization defined by consistent trenching res...",0

Fraser Minten has been a busy man for the Saskatoon Blades, both in offensive production and representing the team at the sport’s highest levels. Acquired in a blockbuster deal with the Kamloops Blazers in November, Minten has come as advertised with eight goals and 18 points scored for Saskatoon since the deal, including a highlight-reel overtime winner on Sunday against the Swift Current Broncos.

Indigo receives privatization offer from Gerald Schwartz's holding company,2024-02-01T23:28:19+00:00,https://www.cp24.com/news/indigo-receives-privatization-offer-from-gerald-schwartz-s-holding-company-1.6752239,"Advertisement An Indigo bookstore is seen Wednesday, November 4, 2020 in Laval, Que. 
	TORONTO - Indigo Books & Music Inc. says it has received a proposal to take the retailer private from a pair of companies owned by controlling shareholder Gerald Schwartz. 
	The non-binding proposal from Trilogy Retail Holdings Inc. and Trilogy Investments L.P. would see them purchase the issued and outstanding shares of Indigo it does not already own for $2.25 in cash per common share. 
	The two Trilogy firms are personal holding companies of Schwartz, the Onex Corp. founder and chairman who sits on Indigo's board of directors and is the spouse of Indigo chief executive Heather Reisman. 
	Through the Trilogy firms, Schwartz is the controlling shareholder of Indigo. He owns around 56 per cent of the company's issued and outstanding common shares, while another 4.6 per cent belong to Reisman through a different holding company. 
	Trilogy says the offer represents a 50 per cent premium over Indigo's closing price on the last day of January. 
	It says it's not interested in selling any of its shares. 
Indigo announced layoffs earlier this year as part of the retailer's ongoing efforts to streamline its operations. 
Indigo spokeswoman Melissa Perri said at the time that the cuts were part of the company's strategic plan meant to return the business to profitability. 
	The company has seen several quarters of financial losses as well as a number of changes to its executive and board of directors over the last year. 
	Most recently, the company reported a net loss of $22.4 million in its second quarter, a period when founder and chief executive Heather Reisman retired and turned the business over to Peter Ruis. 
	Ruis left the company abruptly in September, making way for Reisman to return. 
	Shares in Indigo closed Thursday down 1.33 per cent at $1.48. The stock price's 52-week high was $2.60 on Oct. 4. 
	The retailer will report its financial results for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023 in the coming weeks, but has not yet set a date for their release. 
	This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 1, 2024.

		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Macy’s CEO Tony Spring will officially grab the reins on Sunday as the storied retailer faces slowing sales growth and takeover threats. Spring, 58, who has climbed the ladder at high-end sister company Bloomingdales, has been Macy’s CEO-elect since last March — when Jeff Gennette announced plans to retire. “I am excited to take on the role of CEO of Macy’s, Inc. and to apply my over three decades of experience with our nameplates to build on this strong foundation and lead our company forward,” Spring said in a statement. He is stepping up at a critical time. The company announced plans to slash 2,300 corporate jobs, or 13% of its corporate workforce, and will close five mall-based anchor stores – out of 722 in the US – as sales growth and customer traffic both drop off. More concerning are recent overtures from two sizeable investors, Arkhouse Management and Brigade Capital Management, who made a $5.8 billion bid to take Macy’s private last December.  Macy’s rejected the offer last month.  Another private equity firm, Sycamore Partners, is exploring a possible acquisition of the New York-based company, as The Post reported. Macy’s declined to comment, as did Sycamore, which owns numerous apparel brands including The Limited, Talbots, Ann Taylor and the southern department store chain Belk. Macy’s valuable real estate, which includes its massive flagship store in Herald Square, has ignited several other takeover attempts in recent years, including from Hudson’s Bay Co., which owns rival Saks Fifth Avenue.  Real estate investors, Arkhouse and Brigade have threatened to take their offer directly to shareholders. One of Gennette’s last tasks was to tell tell Arkhouse and Brigade that Macy’s board has concerns about their ability to come up with the cash to finance the deal. Gennette, 62, spent seven years at the helm and four decades at the company. In the last quarter, Macy’s sales dropped 7.1% to $4.9 billion compared to a year ago, and comparable store sales fell 6.7%. At Bloomingdale’s, comparable store sales declined 4.4% in the quarter and the company’s digital sales fell by 7%. Advertisement",-3

Inter bolji od Juventusa: Vlahović pucao iz praznih pištolja na Đuzepe Meaci,2024-02-04T21:40:52+00:00,https://www.telegraf.rs/sport/fudbal/3830829-inter-bolji-od-juventusa-vlahovic-pucao-iz-praznih-pistolja-na-djuzepe-meaci,"Vreme čitanja: oko 1 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 1 min. Fudbaleri Juventusa za koji nastupaju Filip Kostić i Dušan Vlahović, dvojica reprezentativaca Srbije, pretrpeli su poraz u 23. kolu Serije A, pošto je od njih bio bolji Inter na svom terenu sa minimalnih 1:0 i to nakon autogola Federika Gatija. Inter je trenutno vodeći tim u Seriji A, zbog čega je njemu i pripao epitet favorita u ovom duelu, ali su crno-beli iz Torina ti koji već neko vreme igraju dosta ozbiljno, pogozovo zahvaljujući Dušanu Vlahoviću, koji jednostavno nije bio na visini zadatka protiv aktuelnog šampiona. Kada se pogleda statistika i celokupni uticaj utakmice, reklo bi se da su zapravo i jedni i drugi dosta podbacili u napadačkom smislu, jer je viđen samo jedan gol iz čak 26 šuta koja su upućena ka golovima koja čuvaju Vojćeh Šćesni i Jan Zomer. Jedini gol je viđen u 37. minutu susreta, kada je Federiko Gati nehotice loptu ubacio u svoju mrežu.

"How to write a lead-winning, memorable real estate agent bio (+ examples)",2024-02-08T23:35:12+00:00,https://www.housingwire.com/articles/real-estate-agent-bio/,"  Gain a few expert insights from these real-life examples, and learn how to write a real estate agent bio that attracts new clients. Vetted by HousingWire  |  Our editors independently review the products we recommend. When you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. As a real estate agent, you may think clients should care more about their next home than your life story. And while that may be true, well-crafted real estate agent bios can build trust and credibility and serve as a powerful tool in an agent’s marketing arsenal — giving prospective clients. After all, prospective clients are trusting you with one of their biggest financial decisions. A national research study conducted by Brand Builders Group found that some 74% of all Americans and 85% of millennials aged 35 to 44 say they are more likely to trust someone who has an established personal brand. Writing an expert real estate agent bio is the first step in creating that trust and credibility. While there’s no exact formula, every well-written bio includes a few key features, which we dive into below. Follow these tips to differentiate yourself from the pack and enhance your professional brand. Your real estate bio is how you shape the narrative about your services and brand. It is often the first point of contact between you and potential clients, or it’s how clients confirm if you’re the right fit after you’ve been referred to them. A good real estate agent bio offers relatable glimpses into your personality while sharing relevant accolades, achievements and expertise. Practically speaking, your future clients will be skimming for information that reveals your knowledge about their neighborhood or zip code, and whether you’ve worked with the type of property they are buying or selling. They’ll want to know you have what it takes to close the type of deal they are looking for, and that you can help them reach their financial goals. But on a more basic level, people like to connect human-to-human. So let your personality shine. Showcase the best and most authentic parts of yourself by sharing a few selective personal details. Writing a real estate agent bio is all about finding the balance between capturing the client’s attention, sharing your genuine personality and showcasing your expertise. Most readers scroll through bios quickly, so you want to include some eye-catching buzzwords. To help you get started, here’s a list of everything you should include in a real estate agent’s bio, plus some buzzy keywords to help you phrase your message in a memorable way. It sounds obvious, but too many real estate agents forget to share their expertise. It’s okay to be a little braggadocious! Start strong by describing your professional background. Lead with your most eye-catching (and even most obvious) resume milestones, such as: Check out this bio from Tate Kelly of Coldwell Banker Warburg: Tate Kelly is a riddle of valuable contradictions.

Globalive’s Lacavera says deal in place to acquire Wealth One Bank of Canada,2024-02-09T22:37:29+00:00,https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/ontario-news/globalives-lacavera-says-deal-in-place-to-acquire-wealth-one-bank-of-canada/,"TORONTO — Globalive Capital Inc. founder Anthony Lacavera says the investment firm has entered into an agreement to acquire Wealth One Bank of Canada. He says by email that the proposed transaction is pending all regulatory and government approvals. The Globe and Mail first reported on the bid, saying Lacavera had raised $51 million for a consortium bid to take a 54-per-cent stake in the bank, which has been subject to federally imposed national security conditions. Lacavera told The Canadian Press that Globalive is looking to make the acquisition because the firm sees a long-term opportunity to provide Canadians more choice in banking services, and that it plans to bring the same challenger approach it took in the telecom industry. Through Globalive, Lacavera founded wireless carrier Wind Mobile in 2008, which was sold to Shaw Communications for $1.6 billion in 2016. Wealth One Bank of Canada was founded in 2016 and, as of November, had a little over $600 million in assets according to the latest filings with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Feb. 9, 2024.

MARIE, Ont. — Algoma Steel Group Inc. says five workers were taken to hospital after an incident on Wednesday night at the north casthouse of its blast furnace complex. The company says it believes slag made contact with moisture in the hot iron trough, impacting 12 workers, including five who were treated at Sault Area Hospital and have since been released. The accident comes after the collapse of a structure supporting utilities piping at Algoma’s coke-making plant last month.

Canadian PM Justin Trudeau ‘furious’ at ‘garbage decision’ by Bell for mass layoffs around record Super Bowl ad sales,2024-02-10T20:00:22+00:00,https://awfulannouncing.com/international/justin-trudeau-bell-layoffs-garbage-canada.html,"Awful Announcing Over the last decade, Canada’s BCE Inc. (parent of Bell Media, which owns TSN, CTV, and more) has gone through several rounds of layoffs. Those have included 380 cuts in 2015, multiple rounds of layoffs in 2017, more than 200 cuts in 2021, cuts of 1,300 people last summer, and now, cuts of 4,800 people (across all of BCE, with an estimated 10 percent of that at Bell Media specifically) and sales of 45 regional radio stations this week. And the latter move has Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau “furious,” as it came right after the federal government granted Bell $40 million in regulatory relief: “I’m furious. This is a garbage decision by a corporation that should know better,” PM Justin Trudeau tells reporters in King City, Ont., as he responds to a question about recently announced layoffs at Bell. #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/udtnqbY8O7 — CPAC (@CPAC_TV) February 9, 2024  Those remarks came at a press conference with Ontario premier Doug Ford (seen behind Trudeau) in King City, ON about a $3.1 billion deal to improve healthcare access and reduce wait times. But Trudeau’s fiery remarks here wound up getting more attention than what he was there to discuss. Here’s a transcription of his remarks: “I’m furious. This is a garbage decision by a corporation that should know better. We have seen over the past years journalistic outlets, radio stations, small community newspapers, bought up by corporate entities who then lay off journalists, change the quality of offerings to people, and then when people don’t watch as much or engage as much, the corporate entity says ‘Ah, see, they’re not profitable any more, we’re going to sell them off.’ “This is the erosion not just of journalism, of quality local journalism, at a time where people need it more than ever given misinformation and disinformation, but it’s eroding our very democracy. Our abilities to tell stories to each other of how people’s lives are, stories that reflect our own communities and not just central offices in our biggest cities, is part of what binds this country together from coast to coast to coast. With incredible diversity of local experiences and geographies, we need those voices. “And over the past years, corporate Canada, and there are many culprits in this, have abdicated their responsibilities towards the communities that they have always made very good profits off of in various ways. And as a government, we have been stepping up over the past year, fighting for local journalism, fighting for investments that we can have, all the while fending off attacks from Conservatives and others who say ‘No, no, no, you’re trying to buy off journalists.’ “We’re trying to support journalism in this country and across this country. But no government can do it alone. Canadians need to demand better, as we will be demanding better, from corporate leaders, like in this case Bell, that are eroding Canadians’ ability to know each other, to trust each other, and to trust in the ...",0

New ETF gives maximum foreign exposure on the JSE,2024-02-11T22:00:49+00:00,https://www.herald.co.zw/new-etf-gives-maximum-foreign-exposure-on-the-jse/,"s Unless you’re bullish on SA Inc, there’s little reason to buy the Top 40 these days, which makes Satrix’s JSE Global Equity ETF Index enticing Simply buying the index on the JSE via an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or index tracker may be cheap (as fees are far lower than those charged by actively managed funds), but the recent performance of the broad South African market has been pedestrian. The Satrix 40 fund delivered a performance of 8,77 percent last year, with the JSE All Share Index (Alsi) up 2,9 percent. A new ETF from the largest passive manager in the country, Satrix, offers investors exposure to locally listed shares but with a bias to global companies.  In recent years, the weighting of inward-listed multinationals has been reducing, with these now only making up around a quarter of the Alsi. This will reduce even further in March when the All Share switches to the shareholder-weighted indices (SWIX) methodology. Financials (banks and insurers) make up nearly 30 percent of the Top 40, so buying ‘the index’ means one is greatly exposed to this sector and ‘SA Inc’ as a whole. Kingsley Williams, chief investment officer at Satrix, says: “This has exposed these equity indices more to local macroeconomic idiosyncrasies (often referred to as ‘SA Inc. factors’), which clients may wish to diversify away from within their local equity exposure. “The new ETF has a significantly higher rand hedge profile than other broad local equity market indices, providing a potential cushion should the local currency weaken. “It also offers a diversified source of revenue from its constituents, with higher earnings emanating from offshore markets across a variety of sectors.” The new Satrix JSE Global Equity ETF Index tracks the recently launched FTSE/JSE Global Investor Index, focusing on the 50 biggest companies on the JSE (by market capitalisation). This more closely represents the All Share Index that investors may remember from years back – not the index as it exists today.   So-called ‘grandfathered’ companies are those that moved their primary listing offshore before October 2011. Alsi indices used to consider the global free float for these companies. Now only the locally registered free float is used (in other words, only a fraction of those companies are counted towards the index). The five ‘grandfathers’ in this new index are AngloGold Ashanti, BHP Group, Investec plc, Mondi plc and Richemont. Together, they make up 28 percent of the Global Investor Index versus 17 percent in the Alsi. – Moneyweb Other inward-listed stocks, which include AB InBev, British American Tobacco, Glencore, Prosus, Reinet and South32, comprise nearly 37 percent of the new index, compared to under 10 percent in the All Share. Together, these companies, which generate a significant portion of their earnings (sometimes all) from offshore, are 65,1 percent of the Global Investor Index, contrasted with just 26,9 percent of the Alsi as at the end of January.

Five things to watch for in the Canadian business world in the coming week,2024-02-11T20:00:00+00:00,https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/ontario-news/five-things-to-watch-for-in-the-canadian-business-world-in-the-coming-week-97/,"TORONTO — Five things to watch for in the Canadian business world in the coming week: Tim Hortons Restaurant Brands International Inc. will release its fourth-quarter financial results on Tuesday before financial markets open. The company that owns Tim Hortons and other quick-serve restaurants announced a deal last month to buy Carrols Restaurant Group Inc., the largest Burger King franchisee in the United States, for US$1 billion. Housing data Housing data will be in the spotlight Thursday when the Canadian Real Estate Association is expected to release its January home sales figures, after regional numbers showed the market is roaring back to life. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. will also release its latest reading on housing starts in the country the same day. Economic data The picture of how the economy fared at the end of 2023 will become a little clearer this week. Statistics Canada will release its monthly survey of manufacturing for December on Thursday and wholesale trade numbers for December on Friday. 







 TC Energy  Investors will be looking for updates from TC Energy Corp. and its multi-billion-dollar asset divestiture plan when the company reports its fourth-quarter results on Friday. The plan comes as the company works to reduce its debt in the wake of the completion of the costly Coastal GasLink project. Air Canada  Air Canada will report its fourth-quarter results and hold a conference call on Friday before markets open. The airline has been under scrutiny for how it accommodates passengers living with disabilities. Air Canada chief executive Michael Rousseau faced a barrage of questions last week at a House of Commons committee meeting over reports of passenger mistreatment.

'I’m a member of Congress': Freshman House Republican lashes out at CNN host,2024-02-13T23:44:20+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/house-freshman/,"Freshman U.S. Rep. Brandon Williams (R-NY) attempted to promote several falsehoods but was rebuffed by Jim Sciutto, after the CNN host urged him to be respectful. Rep. Williams, whose social media bio reads “People over Politics,” attempted to claim that President Biden could address the border issue with executive actions, including “Remain in Mexico.” Sciutto noted that the courts had stopped several of then-President Donald Trump’s executive actions on the border. “Joe Biden shredded the Remain in Mexico policy his first week in office. He did it very, with great flamboyance and he could reinstate that today simply with a pen,” Williams told Sciutto when asked about the now-dead border bill. “As you know,” Sciutto interjected, “many of the moves President Trump attempted were challenged in courts. You had a Democratic president here, who is willing to give more –” Williams cut him off, saying, “Remain in Mexico was not struck down by the court. That’s simply not true.” “I’m talking about executive privilege,” Sciutto responded, “and powers that the House is saying the President could exercise, but as you know, this is a president who’s actually making concessions that previous different Democratic presidents didn’t make. I just wonder why is it safer for your constituents to have no increased security at the border, as opposed to that negotiated by your Senate Republican colleagues?” READ MORE: ‘Freedom or Terror and Tyranny?’: Biden Takes Aim at Trump and Speaker Johnson “Well,” Williams said, “I’m glad to hear you say that Joe Biden has provided no security at the border along with Secretary Mayorkas. I think that’s a bold admission.” “Not exactly what I said, I did not say that,” Sciutto declared. “That is exactly what you said,” Williams insisted. After talking over Sciutto, the CNN host urged Williams, “Let’s talk as people who respect each other, I respect your service. I’m asking you why no deal is better for your constituents for the rest of the year, as opposed to a deal that significantly tightened up restrictions of the border?” But Williams continued to push falsehoods and GOP talking points. “Well because five, you know, permitting in, in the law, in the code 5000 per day, on average, over a period of time, to enter the country,” William replied, wrongly explaining the deterrents the bill would have provided to border patrol agents. “That’s not true. It’s not true,” Sciutto told him. “It is true, it’s a disaster,” Wiliams insisted. As Sciutto explained the parameters of that portion of the defunct legislation, Williams again interjected: “I’m sorry. Is that is that respecting each other? Is that what you’re getting at here is respecting each other?” “I will challenge you when you say something that’s not true,” Sciutto offered. “I’m a member of Congress, you’re cutting me off,” Williams protested. “It absolutely is true.” “Only when you say something not true,” replied Sciutto. “Oh, I see.

					The Black Media Authority				 By: Career Communications Group, Inc. BALTIMORE – Feb. 14, 2024 – PRLog — The highly anticipated BEYA STEM DTX Conference (www.beya.org), a flagship event dedicated to celebrating the achievements of minorities in STEM fields, is making its return to Baltimore, Maryland at the Baltimore Convention Center on February 15-17, 2024. After moving locations to Washington, D.C. in 2011, the conference is coming back to its roots, marking a significant milestone in its 38-year history. With an average annual attendance of thousands of professionals, students, and enthusiasts, the BEYA STEM DTX Conference has become a nationally recognized platform for promoting Sign up for our Daily eBlast to get coverage on Black communities from the media company who has been doing it right for over 130 years. diversity and inclusion in STEM. This move back to Baltimore is a nod to the conference’s humble beginnings and a testament to its commitment to empowering underrepresented communities in STEM. “Our story started in Baltimore,” reflects Dr. Tyrone D. Taborn, CEO and Publisher at Career Communications Group, “and it’s only right to bring it back home as we edge closer to celebrating 40 years of lifting up underrepresented communities in STEM.” The BEYA STEM DTX Conference is poised to bring significant positive impact to the city and surrounding communities. Beyond the immediate economic benefits of increased tourism and hospitality revenue, this homecoming represents a reaffirmation of Baltimore’s vital role in promoting diversity and excellence in STEM fields. “It is an absolute honor to be the host city for the BEYA STEM DTX Conference in February,” said Al Hutchinson, President and CEO, Visit Baltimore. “In Baltimore, our tech ecosystem is growing rapidly and was recently designated one of 31 tech hubs in the country for groundbreaking research in predictive medical care. From securing major government contracts to supporting young startups and leading the industry in JEDI initiatives, our software, cybersecurity, and IT firms are positioning Charm City as the next leader in the Equitech movement.” As Baltimore takes center stage in the STEM world once again, it creates a space for continued growth, inclusivity, and progress in the years to come.

"Teodosić posle osvajanja Kupa: ""Znači mi puno... Proslava? Dok dođemo u Beograd biće 5, tad ne radi ništa...""",2024-02-17T23:20:42+00:00,https://www.telegraf.rs/sport/kosarka/3839006-teodosic-posle-osvajanja-kupa-znaci-mi-puno-proslava-dok-dodjemo-u-beograd-bice-5-tad-ne-radi-nista,"Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. Košarkaši Crvene zvezde su slavili protiv Partizana u finalu Kupa Radivoja Koraća sa 85:79, čime su po četvrti put uzastopno i osvojili ovaj trofej. Najzaslužniji za bio je Miloš Teodosić, koji je pružio sjajnu partiju s kojom je zaradio i trofej namenjen MVP-ju ovog takmičenja. Teodosić je tokom čitavog finala pokazivao emocije, s obzirom i na to da je stigao u voljeni klub, a čitavu utakmicu je znao da proslavi, što je pokazao i nakon samog meča. On je prvo vodio navijanje, a posle meča je otkrio i da je jako zadovoljan. - Iskren da budem, dugo nisam igrao Kup Srbije. stvarno bih želeo od srca da čestitam i Partizanu na odličnoj utakmici, ne znam kako je bil, jedna odlična utakmica sa obe strane. Publika koja je bila manje-više dobra i jedna odlična utakmica dve evroligaške ekipe, drago mi je što smo pobedili i mislim da je ovo finale bilo uživanje za sve koji su došli da gledaju i koji su gledali. On kaže i da je svaki trofej najdraži. - Svaki trofej mi je najdraži, sigurno da jeste, ali opet... Ima još četiri meseca, ovo treba da bude vetar u leđa. Luka Mitrović je u šali rekao i da nikad nije video takvog Teodosića, za šta je on imao spreman odgovor. - Luka i ja nismo toliko bliski. Šalim se, znači mi puno, možda se videlo sa strane Kako je i gorepomenuto, Teo je vodio navijanje. - Sjajno, veliko hvala što su došli i što su napravili večeras i ne samo večeras, na svakoj utakmici i na Evroligi protiv Žalgirisa gde su svi mislili da niko neće doći, bilo je opet. Podržavaju nas cele sezone i veliko hvala za to i nadam se da će im se vraćati kao i večeras. Na kraju, upitan je Teodosić i o slavlju, a i tu se našalio. - Sad je 12 sati, dok se okupaju, odradi se doping u 1 će da se krene u Beogradu smo oko 4, pola 5, davno su prošla vremena u Beogradu da rade posle 4-5, sve se u 1 zatvara, sutra ćemo slaviti.

"California FBOs Ordered To Stop Selling 100LL, Switch To G100UL",2024-02-17T18:56:06+00:00,https://s30121.pcdn.co/aviation-news/california-fbos-ordered-to-stop-selling-100ll-switch-to-g100ul/,"Lawyers for a California environmental group say most if not all FBOs in California will be required to offer 100LL with General Aviation Modifications Inc.’s (GAMI’s) G100UL starting in the first half of 2024 thanks to a nine-year-old court ruling.  The consent judgment, issued in favor of the Center for Environmental Health in December of 2014 by the California Superior Court in Alameda, says that as soon as there’s an approved commercially available replacement for 100LL, FBOs have to sell 100LL. CEH’s lawyers say they will be allowed to continue to sell 100LL but will also have to stock unleadd fuel. GAMI disagrees with that interpretation and says the FBOs will be compelled to sell only its fuel or another fuel that has no lead in it. CEH’s lawyers have sent notice to all California FBOs to stock G100UL as soon as it becomes commercially available to them. If they don’t, they could be found in contempt and face heavy fines. GAMI head of engineering George Braly said Vitol Aviation, the producer/refiner now licensed to produce G100UL, is scheduled to produce large batches of the fuel later in the spring. Braly said it will “take a few months” to ramp up production and to supply all of the dozens of fuel sellers covered by the order, after which it will be able to maintain a steady supply to them. CEH filed a lawsuit in 2011 against all the 100LL fuel sellers in California for exposing people to lead, and three years later settled the case. The settlement required anyone selling 100LL to post signs explaining the lead content and attendant risks. It also requires that “Settling Defendants distribute and sell the airplane fuel with the lowest lead content that is Commercially Available.” In its December 2023 letter to the FBOs and other fuel distributors, CEH lawyer Mark Todzo said G100UL fulfills those requirements. “It can and should therefore serve as a lower lead replacement for the 100LL fuel you are presently distributing,” the letter says. “Production of G100UL has now begun such that it will be available to [those named in the order] for distribution and sale in California by early 2024.” We have contacted major FBO chains by email for comment but may not hear from them until after the long weekend. As we reported last week, GAMI signed a production agreement with Vitol late last year and became the first licensed producer of the fuel. The company has received all the necessary approvals to make and distribute G100UL. Braly said the raw cost of the components in the fuel vary with the price of crude oil but over the past year have averaged 85 cents to $1.15 per gallon more to make than 100LL. It’s not clear how that will translate to the price at the pump after going through wholesale, distribution and retailing steps in the supply chain. Aircraft operators will also have to buy an STC for each airplane using G100UL and the cost depends on the horsepower of the engine(s) on the aircraft.

"“Arkan nije bio vođa i navijač, ali Knele jeste”: Tima o Željku Ražnatoviću, Maksimiru, osnivanju Delija…",2024-02-18T22:05:50+00:00,https://www.telegraf.rs/sport/fudbal/3839397-arkan-nije-bio-vodja-i-navijac-ali-knele-jeste-tima-o-zeljku-raznatovicu-maksimiru-osnivanju-delija,"Vreme čitanja: oko 7 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 7 min. U trećoj epizodi serijala: ""Ultras - Timina priča"", nekadašnji vođa navijača Crvene zvezde - Zoran Timić govorio je o odnosu Željka Ražnatovića Arkana i severne tribine, ali i o Aleksandru Kneževiću Kneletu. - Arkan nikada nije bio ni navijač, ni vođa navijača Zvezde, kao što se pisalo po medijima. Cela priča počinje kada se na Maksimiru 1990. godine skandiralo protiv Slobodana Miloševića, što se policiji nije dopalo. Razmišljali su kako da nas spreče u tome i među nas poslali Arkana koji je bio pripadnik službe DB. Pojavio se na tom sastanku, na kom ja nisam došao, jer sam bio protiv svega što se tiče Miloševića. Arkan je rekao da treba da budemo navijačka grupa, a ne da se bavimo politikom. To je bilo prihvaćeno, jer druga opcija svakako nije ni postojala. Tada sam se povukao sa tribine, i šest meseci nisam dolazio na utakmice. Gomila laži je izlazila po medijima posle toga koja se odnosila na to da je Arkan osnovao Delije. To su bile laži. On je nekoliko puta u životu bio na severu i cela ta priča o njemu kao vođi je bila fabrikovana od strane SPS režima da bi umirili tribinu da ne skandira protiv Miloševićevog režima - počeo je Timić. Za razliku od Arkana, popularni Aleksandar Knežević Knele je bio navijač Crvene zvezde. - Kneleta je moj komšija doveo kod mene i predstavio ga kao momka koji hoće da ide s nama i da se bije s grobarima. Otišli smo na košarkašku utakmicu ubrzo, a on je čak skupljao i štangle, i pokazao se dobro. Dugo je pričao o tome kako je išao sa ultrasima, ali je posle otišao u potpuno druge vode. Jedno vreme, oko godinu dana, je bio deo navijačke grupe. Prisetio se Tima i popodneva kada su Zvezdini navijači tukli Albance po Beogradu. - Naelektrisanje se osetilo već na utakmici sa OFK Beogradom kada smo pevali ""Bacićemo minu na Prištinu, da šiptari svi od nje izginu"". Mi smo se posle utakmice skupili ispred severa i imali ideju da idemo na železničku stanicu i čekamo grobare koji su se vraćali sa utakmice iz Kragujevca, da ih malo naučimo pameti. Nas je bilo oko 300, 400 i krenuli smo preko Autokomande, dobro naoružani jer smo izlomili neke klupe. Na tom putu videli smo kiosk gde se prodaju semenke koji su držali Albanci i neko je rekao: ""Juriš braćo Srbi, udri po šiptarima"". Cela radnja je stradala momentalno, pa smo posle toga naleteli na još jedan kiosk koji su držali Albanci, te je na Slaviji prebijen prodavac kukuruza, iste nacionalnosti. Grupa je ušla u Studentski kulturni centar što je bilo glavno mesto u kom su se oni okupljali, te je i tu napravljen haos, pa je još jedan prodavac posle stradao. No, od glavne ekspedicije i sukoba sa grobarima nije bilo ništa. Voz je stigao pola sata ranije od kad smo mi došli. Smatra Tima da je ključni razlog njegovog hapšenja bila podrška Draži Mihajloviću. - Vraćao sam se kući i jedan od drugara mi je rekao da me je policija tražila, tačnije da su mi dolazili na kuću. Pritajio sam se u stanu, ali sam znao da će u toku noći da upad...",0
Bitfury Group Announces Planned Distribution of Shares in Cipher Mining,2024-02-18T21:30:09+00:00,https://financenews.co.uk/crypto/bitfury-group-announces-planned-distribution-of-shares-in-cipher-mining-2912.html,"Published on Blockchain technology company Bitfury Group has announced a strategic move to distribute shares in Cipher Mining, Inc., a subsidiary, in a bid to unlock potential value for shareholders. The distribution of shares aims to reduce ownership concentration and create a more diversified shareholder base for Cipher. The carefully planned initiative, which has been approved by Bitfury shareholders, will involve the distribution of 16,127,092 shares of Cipher to Bitfury Series C shareholders within seven business days. Following this initial step, Bitfury is considering distributing approximately 126 million shares of Cipher to its remaining shareholders as a second step, which would see Bitfury retain around 50 million shares of Cipher, reducing its stake from 75% to less than 20%. However, the second step of the distribution plan is subject to the approval of Bitfury shareholders. Bitfury’s CEO, Val Vavilov, expressed confidence in Cipher’s growth potential and strong fundamentals, stating, “Cipher has consistently demonstrated strong fundamentals and impressive growth potential. I am confident in the substantial market potential of Cipher. This strategic distribution not only aligns with our overarching goal of maximizing shareholder value but also serves to broaden the investor base of Cipher.” The company emphasized that these moves aim to have a positive long-term impact on the future successes of both Bitfury and Cipher. Bitfury, founded in 2011, is a leading blockchain technology company that offers a range of products and services to power the Web 3.0 ecosystem. The press release issued by Bitfury contained forward-looking statements regarding their plans and intentions regarding ownership of Cipher common stock. These statements are subject to uncertainties and risks that could potentially impact actual results. The company encouraged shareholders not to rely solely on forward-looking statements, as they are inherently uncertain and subject to change. Overall, Bitfury remains optimistic about the strategic distribution of Cipher shares and the benefits it will bring to both companies in the long run. The move is seen as a significant step in delivering long-term value to shareholders and enhancing the market potential of Cipher.

Community Teamwork receives $125K MassDevelopment grant for small businesses in the Acre,2024-02-21T23:30:41+00:00,https://www.lowellsun.com/2024/02/21/community-teamwork-receives-125k-massdevelopment-grant-for-small-businesses-in-the-acre/,"E-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters E-Edition LOWELL — Community Teamwork Inc. announced Wednesday that it was awarded a $125,000 MassDevelopment grant to help fund the organization’s Entrepreneurship Center through the Transformative Development Initiative Lowell ACRE Capacity Improvement Program. Once known as the Merrimack Valley Small Business Center, CTI’s Entrepreneurship Program provides technical assistance for prospective entrepreneurs with low incomes in order to help them create and manage their own “micro-enterprises.” In this case, the funding will be used to assist small business owners in Lowell’s Acre neighborhood by assessing their business activities, providing technical assistance through the Entrepreneurship Center, identifying areas where they could improve and providing funds to pay for the changes recommended by CTI staff. “This program will provide crucial holistic support to independent businesses in Lowell’s Acre neighborhood, a TDI District. The partnership between MassDevelopment and CTI’s Entrepreneurship Center is an exemplary government-nonprofit partnership in service to the community,” said Lowell Economic Development Director Ali Carter. The Transformative Development Initiative is a signature economic program through MassDevelopment for Gateway Cities. Using an “accelerator model,” the initiative commits resources to real estate development, growth and stability of small businesses, amenities for the arts and culture and targeted technical assistance and strategic planning for a defined period of time. TDI also requires cities wishing to participate to create a cross-sector partnership that is representative of the neighborhood of focus in order to apply. “In working with the TDI Partnership for the Lowell Acre Community, we look forward to investing our time and effort in this community to help its businesses prosper. The location between UMass Lowell and the entire downtown corridor make this area potentially a conduit for business and cultural exchange. The area is attracting investment, changing before our very eyes while maintaining its essential character and I look forward to seeing the results,” said Entrepreneurship Center Director Charles Smith. In fiscal 2023, MassDevelopment financed 545 projects that generated a total investment of more than $2 billion in the state economy, with the projects estimated to create or support 10,522 jobs and build or preserve 1,583 housing units. When it was rebranded from the Merrimack Valley Small Business Center to the Entrepreneurship Center in 2019, the program’s services were expanded in Middlesex and Essex counties.

Maple Leaf Foods combining meat and plant protein businesses into one,2024-02-22T23:47:36+00:00,https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/ontario-news/maple-leaf-foods-combining-meat-and-plant-protein-businesses-into-one/,"MISSISSAUGA, Ont. — Maple Leaf Foods Inc. is combining its meat and plant protein businesses into one as it seeks to focus the company and drive growth.  “We are pivoting to a new chapter, and it’s a chapter that we expect to be lucrative for all Maple Leaf stakeholders,” said Maple Leaf CEO Curtis Frank on a conference call Thursday discussing the company’s fourth-quarter earnings.  As part of the shift, the company announced an organizational shuffle that sees Adam Grogan promoted to the role of chief operating officer, while Casey Richards has been posted to the newly created job of president, Maple Leaf Foods USA.  RBC Dominion Securities analyst Irene Nattel said the change should streamline the company. It’s a “more accurate reflection of how plant and meat are currently operating, and of the anticipated growth of the segment,” she said in a note.  The reorganization came as Maple Leaf reported a fourth-quarter loss of $9.3 million or eight cents per share for the quarter ended Dec. 31 compared with a loss of $41.5 million or 34 cents per share a year earlier. The company said the improvement for the quarter was driven by pricing to mitigate inflation, stronger pork markets, and other factors. Sales totalled $1.19 billion for the quarter, about the same as a year earlier. Sales for the company’s meat protein business amounted to $1.16 billion, up from $1.15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, while plant protein sales totalled $36.5 million, down from $40.0 million a year earlier. Frank said in a news release that results for the meat protein business fell below expectations due to continuing challenges in the global pork market as well as “a challenging consumer demand environment.”  Softening consumer behaviour contributed to softer results in prepared meats and poultry, he told investors, as inflation and higher interest rates continue to weigh on shoppers.  The unprecedented pork market conditions have persisted for longer than the company expected, Frank said. 







 But while the market conditions are continuing into the first quarter, “there is promising news on the horizon,” he said. Global protein markets are expected to improve throughout 2024 and feed prices are declining.  “European production has been reduced, improving the global supply and demand balance, and pork continues to be affordable relative to other competitive proteins, setting up a favourable demand environment.” The company is also expecting more benefits to come through from investments in two facilities, its London Poultry Plant and its Bacon Centre of Excellence.  “We are bringing an end to an intense period of investment as we completed the build-out of our world-class network and have now started our path to deleveraging the balance sheet as we move into our next phase,” Frank said.  The company achieved the goal it had set for its plant protein business in 2023: for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to be neutral or...",1

"Dečak ocu ukrao lovački nož, pa izbo devojčicu sa kojom je bio u vezi: Mara krvava bežala, oni su je spasili",2024-02-24T20:26:01+00:00,https://www.telegraf.rs/vesti/svet/3843087-decak-ocu-ukrao-lovacki-noz-pa-izbo-devojcicu-sa-kojom-je-bio-u-vezi-mara-krvava-bezala-oni-su-je-spasili,"Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. Mara (17), srednjoškolka iz Rumunije, koju je u petak na ulici u Severinu nekoliko puta izbo njen dečko, operisana je u regionalnoj bolnici i u stabilnom je stanju. Lekari se bore za život njenog dečka Roberta koji je nakon krvavog pira pokušao sebi da oduzme život. Sve se odigralo u prepodnevnim časovima u Severinu, naočigled brojnih svedoka na ulici. Motiv za napad je navodno Robertov strah da će ga Mara ostaviti, te je duže vreme planirao da je ubije. Lovački nož kojim je izbo devojčicu, a potom sebe, navodno je uzeo iz očeve garaže. U petak ujutru je otišao u školu i pobegao posle trećeg časa, a onda je nagovorio i Maru da pobegne. Čekao ju je u parku u centru grada. Mara, ne sluteći šta će da se dogodi, došla je da se nađe sa Robertom u društvu drugarice. Ubrzo su se pozdravile i Mara je sela kraj Roberta na klupu. Navodno su nekoliko minuta razgovarali mirno, nakon čega je Mara ustala i krenula svojim putem. U sledećem trenutku Robert je skočio sa nožem u rukama i počeo krvnički da je ubada. ""Osumnjičeni je iz robe izvukao nož, dug oko 30 centimetara i njime je maloletnoj žrtvi zadao više uboda"", saopšteno je iz kancelarije tužioca. Veruje se da je Robert unapred planirao zločin. Navodno se i drugovima u školi hvalio šta će da uradi. Izvori bliski istrazi navode da su u Robertovom telefonu pronađene poruke od njegovih drugova u kojima je pisalo: ""Nemoj to da radiš"". Očevici jezivog napada kažu da je Robert s leđa napao devojčicu. ""Ona je krenula da beži. Dva puta ju je ubo nožem u leđa, ali kako je jakna bila debela, nije uspeo da joj zarije nož. Onda je uspeo, počela sam da vrištim"", ispričala je žena koja je sa suprugom priskočila u pomoć izbodenoj devojčici. Sva krvava ispričala je kako su uspeli da otmu devojčicu iz kandži pomahnitalog tinejdžera. 
 Upravo su oni uspeli da zaustave taksi u koju su gurnuli devojčicu i urlali na vozača da je odmah vozi u bolnicu. (Telegraf.rs) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona +381

Vreme čitanja: oko 1 min. Fudbaleri Real Madrida propisno su se namučili i oznojili kako bi došli do tri boda večeras u 26. kolu španske Primere protiv Sevilje na domaćem terenu. Junak trijumfa na kraju je bio Luka Modrić - 1:0 (0:0). Hrvatski reprezentativac bio je tvorac jedinog pogotka na meču u 80. minutu, a mrežu je uspeo da zatrese sa ivice kaznenog prostora. Prethodno je Lukasu poništen gol u 10. minutu na asistenciju VAR-a zbog prekršaja, a zbog svega toga ljut je bio i Karlo Anćeloti koji je zbog prigovora zaradio i javnu opomenu. U nastavku, Čuameni je u 39. minutu imao lepu priliku kada je izblokiran, dok je Valverdeov udarac sprečio golman Sevilje, Niland u nadoknadi prvog poluvremena. I u nastavku je Real bio dominantniji, pa je zasluženo došao do bodova. Sada je na 65 bodova na prvom mestu, sa osam više od Barse i devet od Đirone koja ima meč manje sa Rajom, dok je Sevilja na 15. mestu sa 24 boda, šest više od zone ispadanja.

Five things to watch for in the Canadian business world in the coming week,2024-02-25T20:00:00+00:00,https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/ontario-news/five-things-to-watch-for-in-the-canadian-business-world-in-the-coming-week-99/,"TORONTO — Five things to watch for in the Canadian business world in the coming week: Cargojet results Cargojet Inc. will report its fourth-quarter results and hold a conference call with investors before markets open on Monday. The report comes after a slide in consumer spending squeezed the air cargo company’s bottom line in its third quarter. Bank earnings Canada’s big banks will report their first-quarter results this week. Scotiabank and Bank of Montreal will report on Tuesday followed by National Bank of Canada and Royal Bank of Canada on Wednesday. CIBC, TD Bank and Laurentian Bank are expected to release their results on Thursday. Spin Master results Toy company Spin Master is expected to report its fourth-quarter results after the close of markets on Wednesday. In its preliminary results released earlier this month, the company says revenue for its fourth quarter totalled US$502.6 million, up from US$465.8 million a year earlier. 







 GDP report Statistics Canada will release on Thursday its figures for gross domestic product for December and the fourth quarter of 2023. A preliminary estimate suggested real gross domestic product rose 1.2 per cent on an annualized basis in the fourth quarter, following a decline of a similar magnitude in the third quarter. Canadian Natural results Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. will issue its fourth-quarter and full-year results before markets on Thursday. The company is a major contracted shipper on the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.

DOE negotiates with United Power about microgrid project,2024-03-01T23:36:03+00:00,https://www.dailycamera.com/2024/03/01/doe-negotiates-with-united-power-about-microgrid-project/,"e-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters e-Edition 
			Trending:		 The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations will begin negotiations with United Power Inc. as it considers the utility for up to $6.1 million in grant funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The grant would be part of the Energy Improvements in Rural or Remote Areas program. United Power’s Fort Lupton Microgrid project was selected as one of 17 clean energy projects across 20 states and 30 tribal nations and communities to receive more than $366 million to ensure more reliable power, lower energy costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, provide economic growth opportunities, and support the nation’s rural and remote communities. “We are excited that this unique project was recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy through this program,” Mark A. Gabriel, United Power CEO and president, said in a written statement. “United Power is in the process of changing our operating structure to invest in more local power generation, and that includes developing energy solutions along with local leadership. United Power has a long history of partnering with the communities we serve to bring them the services their residents need, and this innovative microgrid project is an illustration of that commitment. I encourage all our members to read more about our vision for United Power’s energy future on our Cooperative Roadmap.” The Fort Lupton Microgrid project was designed to increase the reliability of the city’s municipal water treatment plant. The project will replace an aging diesel generator with a floating photovoltaic array, coupled with battery storage, that will help to ensure a clean, reliable water source for residents of Fort Lupton. The project will bring construction jobs to the area, and United Power is partnering with Aims Community College and the BUENO Centre for Multicultural Education to provide contracting outreach in the community. Schneider Electric will lead the construction of the microgrid. The project is eligible for up to $6.1 million in funding. “We expect this project to increase power redundancy while reducing our costs,” said Chris Cross, Fort Lupton city administrator. “We are projecting a 9% savings on the city’s monthly power bill. Coupled with the floating panel benefits to the water storage, we are excited to see how high our overall savings will be from the project.” This article was first published by BizWest, an independent news organization, and is published under a license agreement. © 2024 BizWest Media LLC.

Watch out for Ex-Pres. Duterte: Farmers’ top choice for 2025 Senate Race,2024-03-02T23:20:08+00:00,https://journal.com.ph/watch-out-for-ex-pres-duterte-farmers-top-choice-for-2025-senate-race/,"EX-PRESIDENT Rodrigo Roa Duterte is the man to beat in the 2025 Senate race, as he was picked out by various farmers’ groups among the senatorial bets for the forthcoming midterm elections. The erstwhile Philippine president topped the latest survey conducted from Feb. 5-9 by the Publishers Association of the Philippines, Inc. (PAPI). He got 66.1% while landing second is SAGIP partylist representative Rodante Marcoleta with 58.2% and Sen. Imee Marcos came in third with 58%. Marcos was followed by Sen. Francis Tolentino who came in fourth with 55.7% and tailing behind him is Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa with 52.9%. Other preferred senatorial bets were ACT-CIS party-list Rep. Erwin Tulfo for the 6th slot with 50.3% followed by former Senate President Vicente “Tito” Sotto III, 45.9%; the boxing icon, former Sen. Emmanuel Pacquiao, took the 8th slot with 44.5%, while Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go, for the 9th with 40.4%. Former VP Leni Robredo took the 10th also with 40.4%, former Manila City Mayor Francisco “Isko” Moreno with 37.1% and Sen. Pia Cayetano with 35.9%, thus completing the Magic 12 or Top 12. Meanwhile, among the other top choices were former President Duterte’s spokesman Harry Roque, 50.3%; actor Sen. Manuel “Lito” Lapid, 45.9%; followed by National Defense Secretary Gilbert “Gibo”Teodoro, 44.5%; former Sen. Richard Gordon, 40.4%; former vice presidential candidate, Dr. Willie Ong, 37.1%; Local Government Secretary Benhur Abalos, 35.9% and former VP Jejomar Binay, 33.9%. There were 1,500 farmer respondents from Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao and they were asked randomly as to their senatorial bets for 2025 midterm polls. Based on a separate interview, political observers noted that Marcoleta’s sudden rise to No. 2 was attributed to his project “Kiskisin mo Baby” — a nationwide campaign to rescue all rice farmers by forming a formula that may prevent hoarders and smugglers – believed to be behind the continuous rice price hikes. On the other hand, it was late last year when former President Duterte announced his intention to run either as senator in 2025 or seek the nation’s second-highest post if his daughter, vice-president Sara Duterte, was impeached during the controversy on confidential fund. He made his presence felt anew. Meanwhile, it’s not surprising that President Bongbong Marcos’ eldest sister is so popular. Aside from being known as “Super Ate ng Pangulo” (SAP), Sen. Imee is also known to oppose some policies of her brother. Many political pundits, however, also noted that it’s still too early to conclude on survey results. They said that “anything can still happen between now and 2025.”",0

			Trending:		 Packers Sanitation Services Inc., which federal investigators recently deemed to be a repeat offender of child-labor regulations, is laying off or relocating 175 contract sanitation employees who work at a JBS USA meat-processing facility on Eighth Avenue in Greeley. “By way of background, PSSI is a privately held sanitation contractor that has sanitized (the) JBS USA facility since Jan. 1, 2000,” according to a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act notice filed Tuesday with the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment. “Recently, we received unforeseen notice from JBS USA that it has decided to contract (with another company at) the Greeley, Colorado, location, meaning that PSSI will cease services at this plant effective April 18, 2024. This will result in the layoff or relocation of all PSSI employees at this plant.” In a letter to employees that was attached to the WARN filing, PSSI said it will offer every Greeley employee an opportunity to transfer to another job site within “a reasonable commuting distance” from the JBS plant. “Your separation is not a reflection on you or your work performance for this company,” PSSI, representatives, who did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday afternoon, wrote to employees. PSSI, headquartered in Kieler, Wis., and owned by the Blackstone private-equity firm, is “the premier provider of food safety solutions in North America, offering comprehensive sanitation services, chemical products, pest management, and intervention solutions for food processing facilities,” according to its website. In the past, some of those “comprehensive sanitation services” have been provided to meatpackers by child laborers, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. PSSI paid $1.5 million in civil penalties last year after federal regulators “found the company employed at least 102 children — from 13 to 17 years of age — in hazardous occupations and had them working overnight shifts at 13 meat processing facilities in eight states,” the department said in a 2023 news release. Investigators determined that four underaged workers were employed by PSSI in the Greeley JBS facility. Dozens more children, some of whom were found to be “working with hazardous chemicals and cleaning meat processing equipment including back saws, brisket saws and head splitters,” worked for PSSI at JBS plants in Nebraska and Minnesota, the labor department said. JBS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon. While PSSI told investigators that it had not knowingly hired minors, “the child labor violations in this case were systemic and reached across eight states and clearly indicate a corporate-wide failure by Packers Sanitation Services at all levels,” principal deputy administrator of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division Jessica Looman said in a 2023 statement. “These children...",-3

February auto sales jump 24 per cent to highest-ever sales for the month: DesRosiers,2024-03-04T23:04:00+00:00,https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/ontario-news/february-auto-sales-jump-24-per-cent-to-highest-ever-sales-for-the-month-desrosiers/,"TORONTO — February auto sales hit an all-time high for the month after jumping 24.4 per cent from last year, DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc. said Monday.  Sales totalled an “astounding” 129,000 units for the month, the consultancy said, up from around 104,000 for the same month last year.  The sales total also eclipsed the 125,000 units sold in February 2020, the last time the month had an extra day and just before the pandemic threw the industry into turmoil. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.1 million units for the unseasonably warm month was the highest since January 2018, said DesRosiers. The latest sales figures, marking the 16th consecutive month of year-over-year growth, shows many of the challenges faced by the industry are now under control, said Andrew King, managing partner at DesRosiers, in a release.  “February 2024 sales tell us that some of the hurdles of recent years — and specifically the supply constraints of new vehicles — are now well and truly in the rear-view mirror.” The pandemic had created supply issues both through plant shutdowns and a surge in demand for electronics that led the auto industry to have a shortfall of semiconductors. The disruptions led to a shortage of supply and a surge in pricing as automakers focused on their priciest and most profitable models. 







 Production is expected to finally return to pre-pandemic levels this year.  A Scotiabank report last month estimated that North American production should hit 16 million units this year, roughly in line with the 10-year pre-pandemic average. Last year’s production was estimated at 15.6 million units, while the 2021 low was 12.9 million. But while production is recovering, prices are still elevated. The average price of a new vehicle hit $67,259 in December, up 14.2 per cent from a year earlier, said AutoTrader in its latest monthly report. The average for used vehicles reached $36,863, a 1.7 per cent increase. More supply does look to be at least taking pressure off price growth. The average new vehicle price in December was down 0.3 per cent from November, while the used vehicle price was down 2.4 per cent from the previous month.  But even with prices high, King said there is enough pent-up demand to keep helping drive sales. This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 4, 2024.

Kat Walk and NAACP battle on the basketball court,2024-03-06T23:36:35+00:00,https://www.dailyeasternnews.com/2024/03/06/kat-walk-and-naacp-battle-on-the-basketball-court/,"This poll has ended. 
            Do you treat student evaluations seriously?             Sorry, there was an error loading this poll. The Battle of the Best Tournament was held Friday evening at 7 p.m. in Groniger Arena by EIU Kat Walk and the NAACP.   This tournament consisted of six competing teams: the Black Student Union, the Kat Walk, Iota Phi Theta Fraternity Inc., Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc., Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc. and the NAACP.    For this competition, each team selected their best five players to participate in a basketball tournament.   The teams that competed in the game’s last round, the championship round, were the Kat Walk and Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity.   According to students at the event, the majority had their bets on Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, however The Kat Walk shockingly won.   The process of putting this fundraiser event together took lots of planning and dedication, Jada Laws, the vice president of the Kat Walk, said. She said it took a lot of talking to different organizations and that getting Groniger Arena was difficult.   “I pulled a couple of strings; having a lot of connections really brought this all together,” she said.   Laws also mentioned that as a member of the social media team, she participated in a great deal of event promotion, communication and videography.   Kris Gross, a junior physical education major and NAACP president said, that although the idea was brough up only two weeks ago, it was planned and advertised in a week.  “It was a long process, from trying to frame how we were going to do the bracket, to how many teams were going to be playing, how much time, where we were actually going to do it at,” Gross said.  Sheldon Turner Jr., a sophomore accounting major and vice president of NAACP, said the event took a lot to plan, but it worked out for the best.  Black organizations getting together for occasions is important because they allow students on campus to become more socially engaged, said freshman pre-nursing major Aaniyah Hampton who attended the event.   “The black community can seem so small but once we all come together, it definitely highlights and showcases how much we can come together and be positive and make a difference,” said Kyla Moton, a senior English major.    The purpose of this event, according to the students, was to demonstrate that black students can come together and achieve greater things as a group.   “Half of us don’t even know half of the people in the room, so with us being all in one room we’ll be better connected,” Hampton said.    Angelia Cosey, a senior public health major said, “It’s something that needs to happen more often, when you have everybody come together that looks like one another it’s just always one great time,”   Through the success of this event, the students said the NAACP and EIU Kat Walk were able to increase awareness of their organizations and build stronger relationships.      Kimberly Carroll can be reached at 581-2812 or at [emai...",0

Sees Impressive Financial Growth Amid Surge in Bitcoin ETFs",2024-03-10T22:37:17+00:00,https://financenews.co.uk/newswire/coinbase-global-inc-sees-impressive-financial-growth-amid-surge-in-bitcoin-etfs-3471.html,"Published on Coinbase, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, recently reported its fourth-quarter financial results, showcasing a substantial uptick in its financials. The company posted its first quarterly profit in two years, driven by increased trading activity and investor enthusiasm for digital assets. Following this announcement, Coinbase’s shares surged by over 13% in pre-market trading. The surge in trading activity was primarily fueled by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, with Coinbase’s total revenue increasing by 41.5% to $953.80 million. The company’s trading volume also saw a significant spike, growing by 102.6% sequentially. Additionally, COIN’s custodial fee revenue rose by 24.7% quarter-over-quarter to $19.70 million. Coinbase has also asserted its dominance in the Bitcoin ETF custody space, holding the custodial reins for eight out of the 11 newly-incepted bitcoin spot ETFs. The company’s strategic approach aligns with its broader objective of fostering cryptocurrency adoptions within traditional financial institutions. However, despite its commendable financial performance, Coinbase faces potential worries from investors. Concerns include lower trading fees offered by Bitcoin ETFs compared to Coinbase’s platform, the high valuation of COIN’s shares, and regulatory hurdles such as an ongoing lawsuit with the SEC. Looking ahead, Coinbase projects subscription and services revenue for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 to fall between $410 million and $480 million. The company’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, emphasizes the importance of international expansion and the launch of new derivative products to drive growth. Overall, Coinbase’s strategic initiatives, coupled with the surge in Bitcoin ETFs, have positioned the company for success in the evolving crypto market. Industry experts foresee these endeavors enhancing COIN’s market position and advancing the adoption of digital currency within the global financial system.

"Ditch company rebuffs Montava, seeks lawsuit dismissal",2024-03-16T21:37:26+00:00,https://www.reporterherald.com/2024/03/16/ditch-company-rebuffs-montava-seeks-lawsuit-dismissal/,"e-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters e-Edition 
			Trending:		 A ditch company that has blocked the 999-acre Montava development in northeast Fort Collins has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit that the developers filed to force an agreement. Montava Development & Construction LLC, along with related companies, filed a lawsuit against WRCC Inc., the company that owns and operates a ditch across part of what Montava hopes will be a large residential and commercial development near the Anheuser-Busch facility. The lawsuit alleged that after years of negotiations with the Eaton-based company to reach an agreement on ditch crossing, that ditch operators illegally were blocking Montava with demanded changes. WRCC sees the situation differently. In its motion for dismissal of the lawsuit, the ditch company attorneys said that Montava, because it doesn’t actually yet own the property that it wants to develop, does not have standing to file the lawsuit in the first place. It said the property is owned by Anheuser-Busch and the Poudre Valley School District, which are not party to the lawsuit. No. 8 Outlet Ditch is a ditch used to transport water from storage reservoirs to the Larimer and Weld Canal, a conveyance owned by a company also not party to the lawsuit. WRCC alleged that Montava concealed information from the court in its filing, including that a letter that Montava said communicated agreement with its plans for crossing the ditch was based on “an incomplete 50% progress set.” WRCC also said the letter was not a “promise to accept Montava’s proposals.” “…(T)he entire complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a valid claim upon which relief can be granted,” WRCC’s motion concluded. Max Moss from Montava, in a request for comment from BizWest, said “Montava has made a good faith effort for over five years to reach a resolution with the ditch company to allow crossings of its ditch. Although it is unfortunate that legal action became necessary, we remain confident a solution is achievable and we will, of course, respond to its motion and continue with the legal proceedings.” The case is Montava Development & Construction LLC, et al, versus WRCC Inc., case number 2024cv30143 filed in Larimer County District Court on Feb. 19, 2024.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Rick Brooks, Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Brooks? Rick Brooks: Hello, everyone, and thanks you for joining us on today's call. With me today is Chris Work, our Chief Financial Officer. I'll begin with a few remarks about our fourth quarter and full year performance before discussing some of our strategic priorities for 2024. Chris will then take you through the financials and our outlook for the coming year. After that, we'll open the call to your questions. The fourth quarter represented an encouraging finish to what was a challenging year. As was the case throughout fiscal 2023, we faced headwinds in the fourth quarter, including highly promotional activity across the soft lines retail sector and an increasingly selective consumer pressured by the multiyear inflationary impact on discretionary income. That said, our men's business turned positive in November and growth accelerated in both December and January. Overall, momentum built throughout the quarter with total sales trends improving month-to-month, culminating January turning to positive comparable sales, fueling fourth quarter sales and adjusted EPS that were both above the high-end of our guidance ranges. Many ways, the fourth quarter monthly sales trends were a microcosm of the trend we've seen throughout the year. To recap our improving trend line, year-over-year total sales were down 17% in first quarter, down 12% in the second quarter, down 9% in the third quarter and down less than 4% in the fourth quarter, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week, which drove sales slightly positive for the quarter. As we enter 2024, we have continued to see some areas of strength in our business. While total sales trends for February were not yet positive, w...",-2
Photos: Students Take Part In Climate Classroom,2024-03-17T23:29:02+00:00,https://bernews.com/2024/03/photos-students-in-climate-classroom-experience/,"Over 200 Bermuda students took part in the “The Climate Classroom,” an immersive learning experience organized by ASU Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences [BIOS] with support from HSBC. A spokespersonssaid, “The highly anticipated and fully booked Climate Classroom made its return to the ASU BIOS campus recently, leading students through an immersive learning experience. The novel program highlighted climate change science while exploring current and future potential impacts for Bermuda. “With exclusive donor support from HSBC, 230 students participated in this gamified immersive learning experience for M2s across Bermuda between February 27th and March 14th. The Climate Classroom invited students to explore the ASU BIOS campus, learning about the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems and Bermuda’s coastlines through the Curriculum Enrichment Program within ASU BIOS’s Ocean Academy. Students were exposed to future careers in ocean science, while piloting emerging media such as extended reality [XR].” “This training allowed Ocean Academy to find creative new ways to engage students in ASU BIOS’s longstanding atmospheric and ocean research. Creating scientific games enabled us to facilitate student-led data collection and interpretation alongside re-enforcing immersive hands-on STEM experiences,” said Kaitlin Noyes, Director of Education and Community Engagement at ASU BIOS. The spokesperson said, “The workshop was student-led, eliciting interactive hands-on problem solving in small teams both in the laboratory and around the ASU BIOS campus. Throughout the puzzle-style quest students utilized scientific instruments to collect data, applied cross-cutting mathematics and physics concepts, and worked together to solve puzzles. Students worked to unlock clues relating to ocean warming, ocean acidification, greenhouse gasses and shifts in oceanic food webs. “Exclusive donor support from HSBC enable ASU BIOS to deliver this innovative training. Shannon Burgess, Chief Risk Officer, and Executive Committee sponsor of the programme said. HSBC is honored to continue our partnership with the Climate Classroom and witness the positive impact that this education porgramme has on its young participants. We believe this interactive learning experience equips students with skills and awareness needed to become environmental champions and drive meaningful change.” “Students also used virtual reality [VR] to learn through the perspective of tiny plankton, taking them beneath the waves through the “Drop in the Ocean” experience. The experience was narrated by Philippe and Ashlan Cousteau, built from the award-winning micro-photography of Peter Parks, and produced by a collaboration between Vision 3 and Conservation International. Balanced on the back of a virtual jellyfish students met sea turtles and whale sharks, and were led through the microscopic world that serves as the backbone of the oceanic food web. Students also had the opportunity to learn about ...",0

                                                 Longtime Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos dies at 94                                                  BALTIMORE (AP) — Peter Angelos, owner of a Baltimore Orioles team that endured long losing stretches and shrewd proprietor of a law firm that won high-profile cases against industry titans, died Saturday. He was 94. Angelos had been ill for several years. His family announced his death in a statement released by the Orioles that thanked the caregivers “who brought comfort to him in his final years.” Angelos’ death comes as his son, John, is in the process of selling the Orioles to a group headed by Carlyle Group Inc. co-founder David Rubenstein. Peter Angelos’ public role diminished significantly in his final years. According to a lawsuit involving his sons in 2022, he had surgery after his aortic valve failed in 2017. “I offer my deepest condolences to the Angelos family on the passing of Peter Angelos,” Rubenstein said in a statement. “Peter made an indelible mark first in business and then in baseball. The city of Baltimore owes him a debt of gratitude for his stewardship of the Orioles across three decades and for positioning the team for great success.” Born on the Fourth of July in 1929 and raised in Maryland by Greek immigrants, Peter Angelos rose from a blue-collar background to launch a firm in his own name after receiving his law degree from the University of Baltimore in 1961. In August 1993, Angelos led a group of investors that bought the Orioles. The group included writer Tom Clancy, filmmaker Barry Levinson and tennis star Pam Shriver. The price tag of $173 million — at the time the highest for a sports franchise — came in a sale forced by the bankruptcy of then-owner Eli Jacobs. While remaining active in a law firm specializing in personal injury cases, Angelos assumed a hands-on approach to running his hometown team. Few player acquisitions were carried out without his approval, and his reputation for not spending millions on high-priced free agents belied his net worth, which in 2017 was estimated at $2.1 billion. In 1996, his firm brought a lawsuit on behalf of the state of Maryland against tobacco giant Philip Morris, securing a $4.5 billion settlement. The Law Offices of Peter Angelos also earned millions of dollars through the settlement of asbestos cases, including a class-action suit on behalf of steel, shipyard and manufacturing facility workers. Angelos made headlines as well in baseball. In 1995, he was the only one of 28 owners who refused to adhere to a plan to use replacement players during a union strike that began during the 1994 season. “We’re duty bound to provide major league baseball to our fans, and that can’t be done with replacement players,” he insisted.

Earlier this week, Mizuhara was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after Ohtani’s representatives publicly accused him of engaging in a “massive theft” of the baseball star’s money. While Mizuhara initially claimed Ohtani had knowingly paid off $4.5 million of his close friend and longtime interpreter’s gambling debt, representatives for the baseball player disavowed his account to the media. Now, reports from The Athletic and NBC Los Angeles are casting further doubt on Mizuhara’s credibility. The outlets found multiple discrepancies in Mizuhara’s education and work history in a biography that appeared in the Los Angeles Angels’ media guide, starting in 2019. Mizuhara was hired by the Angels after the team drafted Ohtani from Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball league in 2017. Though Mizuhara’s bio says he graduated from the University of California, Riverside in 2007, the school told The Athletic, “Our university records do not show a student by the name of Ippei Mizuhara having attended UC Riverside.” Mizuhara’s links to former MLB pitcher Hideki Okajima have also come under scrutiny. The Angels media guide states Mizuhara worked as Okajima’s interpreter during “Yankees Spring Training in 2012,” but multiple news stories from the time cited by The Athletic show Okajima was released by the Yankees prior to spring training, following a failed physical exam. In a statement earlier this week, the Boston Red Sox corrected reports that Mizuhara worked as Okajima’s interpreter during the 2010 season. “Mizuhara was never employed by the Boston Red Sox in any capacity and was not an interpreter for Hideki Okajima during the pitcher’s time with the team,” it read. “Please know that we have thoroughly checked our files to ensure we are providing accurate information.” The Athletic also reviewed spring 2010 archives from the Boston Globe, which named Ryo Shinkawa as Okajima’s interpreter. On Friday, Major League Baseball announced it had opened an official investigation into the Ohtani gambling ordeal. The day prior, a spokesperson for the IRS told The Associated Press that Mizuhara and alleged illegal bookmaker Mathew Bowyer are both under criminal investigation.

Vreme čitanja: oko 1 min. Fudbalska reprezentacija Nemačke je u prijateljskom meču protiv Francuske slavili sa 2:0, a jedan od strelaca na ovom meču je bio i 20-godišnji Florijan Virc, fudbaler Leverkuzena koji važi i za novo ogromno čudo tamošnjeg fudbala. Virc je postigao gol posle samo sedam sekundi igre, kada je dobio loptu, a onda uputio savršen udarac ka golu Majka Menjona koji je loptu ispratio samo pogledom. Samo dan kasnije, Virc je dao i jednu zanimljivu izjavu, gde je otkrio ko je njegov fudbalski idol. On je za to izdvojio sadašnjeg tehničkog direktora Crvene zvezde, Marka Marina, koji je igrao za Verder od 2009. do 2012. godine. - Moj veliki idol je bio Marko Marin. Imao sam dres Verdera sa njegovim imenom na leđima - istakao je Virc za Špigel. (Telegraf.rs) Pošaljite nam Vaše snimke, fotografije i priče na broj telefona +381

(Robin Northrup/The Fort Morgan Times)  Veterans were treated to cookies, coffee and other snacks brought over from Hawaii. Deborah Funai-Brown brought snacks that were gifted to the veterans at the Coffee with the Vet's at Drovers Cafe on Wednesday. (Robin Northrup/The Fort Morgan Times)  Deborah Funai-Brown, Executive Director of Hawaii Vet2 Vet Inc, in Hilo, Hawaii made a special visit to Drovers Cafe on Wednesday to share information with the NECO VSAP Coffee with the Vet’s group. She shared information about their programs and activities through their Vet2 Vet organization.  Many of the events they hold are similar to the NECO VSAP (Northeastern Colorado, Veterans Suicide Awareness and Prevention) in Morgan County and surrounding areas. Vet2Vet is located in a rural community and struggles with many of the things that veterans in Northeast Colorado do. To effectively provide veteran services, she shared you have to partner with other organizations. Vet2 Vet is working to be that organization for veterans to reach out to when they need information. NECO VSAP is also working to do the same. “If you can provide information about the resources available in one location, veterans know that they can go to that one place to find everything they need,” said Funai-Brown. “We also need to bridge the gap between younger and older veterans and find ways to involve more of the younger veterans.” One problem identified by both groups is transportation for veterans to medical appointments.  Because the closest VA facilities are located in Denver and Fort Collins, many vets who are not able to drive face the problem of getting to their appointments.  There are other organizations in Morgan County that do provide transportation.  Now it is a matter of rounding up all of the information to have on hand when this service is needed. Jeremy Kilpatrick from VSAP attended the event and said that Funai-Brown was invited to be on the Board of Directors for NECO VSAP.  She will be spending time in Colorado and Hawaii throughout the year and will serve as the organization’s grant facilitator. “She will be gathering information, pulling together data and writing our grants,” said Kilpatrick.  “She is fantastic.  We will benefit from all of her knowledge and grant writing experience which in turn will benefit our veteran...",0

Samo Beslać dvocifren u VTB ligi: Novaković iznenađujuće do pobede nad Rebićem i Zagorcem,2024-03-25T23:26:00+00:00,https://www.telegraf.rs/sport/kosarka/3861209-samo-beslac-dvocifren-u-vtb-ligi-novakovic-iznenadjujuce-do-pobede-nad-rebicem-i-zagorcem,"Vreme čitanja: oko 1 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 1 min. Četvorica srpskih košarkaša su danas bila na terenu u okviru VTB lige. Samo jedan je bio dvocifren i to je bio reprezentativac Dušan Beslać, koji je ipak sa svojim Avtodorom poražen na gostovanju Urlamašu u Jekaterinburgu - 82:66.  Srpski košarkaš je meč završio sa 11 poena, a šutirao je 4/7 za dva poena i 1/5 za tri, dok je uz to sakupio i čak sedam skokova. Međutim, to nije bilo dovoljno da se dođe do trijumfa na jako nezgodnom gostovanju u Jekaterinburgu. Može se reći da je Avtodor ovim porazom ostao bez šanse da se domogne mesta u plej-ofu, pošto samo dve ekipe iz plej-aut grupe sa najboljim rezultatima idu u četvrtfinale. Drugi meč dana odigrali su Samara i Nižnji Novgorod, a pomalo neočekivanu pobedu ostvarili su gosti - 70:80. Na ovom meču smo videli čak trojicu srpskih košarkaša. Za Samaru su nastupali Rade Zagorac koji je došao do četiri poena uz tri skoka, dok je Nikola Rebić ubacio tri poena. Sa druge strane je Aleksa Novaković dao šest poena i uhvatio je jedan skok.

				If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.			 Saskatoon Blades forward Rhett Melnyk has seen a lot in his 220-game career in the Western Hockey League, but playoffs have eluded the 19-year-old. After stops in Tri-City and Edmonton, the latter of which he captained to begin the season, Melnyk was acquired by the Blades in late October in exchange for young forward Smyth Rebman in an effort to add more veteran experience to the locker room. That’s resulted in Melnyk becoming a key depth piece for Saskatoon over the course of the 2023-24 WHL season, which will lead to his playoff debut on Thursday night with the Blades facing the Prince Albert Raiders in Game 1 of their opening round series. Melnyk spoke with Global Sports’ Scott Roblin about the excitement for playoff hockey, looking up to Stanley Cup champion Jonathan Toews and how he picked up the game from his family in the latest episode of ‘Blades Bio.’ The email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.

Vreme čitanja: oko 1 min. Sjajno igra Veljko Birmančević ovog proleća za Spartu iz Praga. Slavni klub iz prestonice Češke Republike može da se osloni na nekadašnjeg fudbalera Čukaričkog u ovim presudnim momentima sezone, pošto je danas on bio strelac na utakmici protiv Čeških Budejovica na strani. Igrao se 17. minut utakmice kada je Birmančević primio jednu loptu iskosa na oko 13 metara. Nakon što se namestio na šut, poslao je loptu po zemlji, a golman Budejovica se propisno obrukao. Lepo je Birmančević šutirao, nije to bio toliko jak udarac, ali je golmanu Čeških Budejovica prošao kroz ruke! I naravno, završio je u mreži iza njega za veliko slavlje srpskog fudbalera. Njemu je ovo treći gol u tri meča, pošto je prethodno pogodio za Spartu protiv Hradec Kralovog, kao i u Ligi Evrope protiv Liverpula. Šílená Janáčkova hrubka, Birmančevič snadno skóruje, 0:1.

Labor Department issued stop-work orders to 2 American Dream Mall contractors,2024-04-05T23:28:07+00:00,https://njtoday.news/2024/04/05/labor-department-issued-stop-work-orders-to-2-american-dream-mall-contractors/,"NJTODAY.NET 
			Your neighborhood in print since 1822		 The New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (NJDOL) recently issued stop-work orders to two contractors at the American Dream Mall in East Rutherford on March 19, citing various violations related to labor laws and compliance issues. Metro Construction and Design Inc., based in Flushing, N.Y., was one of the contractors issued a stop-work order. They were working on the Kaiten Zushi project at the mall under a subcontract with S&S Plumbing of Wayne, which had received its own stop-work order on March 12. The violations listed against Metro Construction and Design included failure to register, failure to pay prevailing wages, and unpaid wages or late payments.

 The second contractor issued a stop-work order was Time’s Electric Inc. of Hazlet, working on the Miniso project at the same mall. The violations against Time’s Electric Inc. were extensive and included failure to register, failure to pay prevailing wages, improper classification of construction workers, failure to pay minimum wage, and issues related to earned sick leave records and notifications/postings. Since the expansion of its powers in July 2019, NJDOL has issued a total of 158 stop-work orders, emphasizing its commitment to ensuring fair labor practices and compliance with state regulations in the workplace. Stop-work orders are used to halt employers that exploit workers or are noncompliant with state labor laws. Employers have the right to appeal these orders, with NJDOL required to schedule a hearing within seven days of the appeal. NJDOL also highlighted its ability to levy civil penalties of up to $5,000 per day against employers who violate a stop-work order. These penalties are only lifted once all outstanding back wages, penalties, and related issues are resolved satisfactorily. To further reinforce compliance with labor laws, NJDOL, in collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs and the New Jersey Department of Education, sent direct letters to local governments and boards of education. These letters serve as reminders of their responsibilities under the New Jersey Prevailing Wage Act. NJDOL maintains a comprehensive record of registered public works contractors, which government agencies and entities are advised to consult before engaging in public works projects. This proactive measure aims to prevent project delays and additional costs, benefiting businesses, schools, government entities, and taxpayers alike. Additionally, registered public works contractors are mandated to participate in Registered Apprenticeship programs, ensuring that public funds contribute to the training and development of local workers within the construction sector.

Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. Istočnu obalu Amerike 3. i 4. aprila zahvatio je snažan olujni sistem sa obilnom kišom i jakim pljuskovima sa grmljavinom, uz olujne udare vetra i do 100 km/h, pri čemu su se veoma visoki talasi obrušavali sa Atlantika na priobalno područje. Sistem je bio najjači na području Njujorka, gde su olujni severoistočni vetrovi imali udare od 70 km/h. Za dva dana palo je i do 100 mm kiše po kvadratnom metru, na podrčju Njujorka i do 70 mm. Lokalno je bilo i poplava, dok je u planinama pao obilniji sneg.

Oluja je donela sa severoistoka i hladnu vazdušnu masu, pa su temperature tokom dana opale i na vrednonosti manje od 10°C, što su relativno niske temperature za april. Samo nešto više od 24 sata nakon što je olujni sistem napustio područje Amerike i zaputio se dalje na istok put Atlantika, Istočnu obalu Amerike i Njujork pogodila je još jedna prirodna katastrofa. Juče je oko 10 časova i 30 minut istočni deo SAD pogodio je snažan zemljotres za to područje sveta. Epicentar potresa bio je u Nju Džersiju, oko 60-70 kilometara zapadno od Njujorka, a jačina potresa bila je 4,8 Rihetra. Zemljotres je žestoko zadrmao šire područje Njujorka i poljuljao ne samo visoke zgrade, već i veliki broj oblakodera, kao i sam Kip Slobode. EarthCam captured the moment a 4.8-magnitude earthquake recorded in New Jersey shook residents in surrounding states and New York City on Friday morning. The earthquake was the strongest in NJ since 1884. pic.twitter.com/cKXmXqmxtW— EarthCam (@EarthCam) April 5, 2024 Potres je izazvao ogromnu paniku među ljudima. Zabeležena je i manja materijalna šteta, a kratko je bio obustavljen i avio saobraćaj, kao i rad metroa. Ovo je najjači potres u Njujorku jos od kraja 19. veka i veoma retka pojava za istočne predele SAD. Inače, ekipa Telegrafa koja se u trenutku potresa nalazila u Njujorku, svedočila je o veoma snažnom potresu, koji je izazvao veliku paniku među Njujorčanima.

Yellowstone Inc: How a cowboy show became a money machine,2024-04-06T19:30:00+00:00,https://www.theage.com.au/culture/tv-and-radio/yellowstone-inc-how-a-cowboy-show-became-a-money-machine-20240405-p5fhnr.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_feed,"We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable. We’re working to restore it. Please try again later. Add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time. Kevin Costner is not famous for his humility. When he quit the neo-western TV drama Yellowstone in 2023 over creative issues and “arduous” salary negotiations to focus on his own two-part cowboy movie Horizon: An American Saga, industry tip sheet Puck revealed he’d negotiated an unusual clause in his contract that forbid producers from killing him off in a way that would “cause shame or embarrassment to the character”. Showing no shame or embarrassment himself, Costner seems to have reversed his position and is reportedly lobbying to appear in the final fifth season. Filming starts on season five part two this northern spring and the scripts don’t currently involve his character John Dutton. You’d think it’s a no brainer. Costner is a big-name star, Yellowstone is on the small US cable station Paramount and its tiny streaming service Paramount +. Kevin Costner as rancher John Dutton on the set of Yellowstone.Credit: Stan But Yellowstone is no ordinary show. In the multi-fragmented streaming era it is a monumental hit, growing from its 2018 launch to become the most watched TV show in America. Season four pulled in more than 12 million viewers and season five’s premier attracted 16 million. Amazon and Netflix have already commissioned copycat neo-Westerns and studio bosses are so keen to keep the saga going with or without Costner that his British co-star Kelly Reilly is on the verge of signing a new contract for a forthcoming spin-off worth $1.2 million ($1.8 million) an episode, making her one of the best paid actors in the US. All of this has conspired to make Yellowstone’s creator Taylor Sheridan one of the most powerful showrunners in Hollywood. The bad news for Costner is, he hasn’t made up his mind if he wants Kevin back. It’s a spectacular switch in status. Twelve years ago, Costner was filming Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit at Pinewood Studios while Sheridan, 54, was a struggling actor down to his last $800 after quitting crime drama Sons of Anarchy. Having realised he would never be a star, he started shopping around his first screenplay. “I was a fair actor, but that’s all I was ever going to be,” Sheridan told the Hollywood Reporter last year. “Hollywood will tell you what you’re supposed to do if you listen. If you’re banging your head against the wall for 20 years trying to be an actor, maybe you shouldn’t be an actor. But the first thing I ever wrote, the pilot for Mayor of Kingstown in 2011, got me meetings at every major network, at every agency. I had multiple people trying to buy it.” Taylor Sheridan has helped Paramount’s new streaming service, Paramount+, gain millions of new subscribers with multiple spin-offs of Yellowstone.Credit: Crystal Wise He penned movies – 2015’s Sicario, 2016’s Hell or High Water and 2017’s Wind River – but he’d been working on Yellowstone...",0

Cemex to continue operating plant as it reviews closure order,2024-04-11T23:42:58+00:00,https://www.dailycamera.com/2024/04/11/cemex-to-continue-operating-plant-as-it-reviews-closure-order-2/,"e-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters e-Edition 
			Trending:		 Cemex Inc. will continue operating its Lyons cement plant for at least the next month as it evaluates Boulder County’s recent order to shutter the facility.  “Cemex is reviewing the notice issued by Boulder County’s director of community planning and permitting regarding the land use status of our Lyons cement plant and will respond within the next 30 days,” the company said in a statement emailed to BizWest on Thursday. “Cemex will continue to operate the plant under operating conditions, producing high-quality cement without disruption to our hard-working employees or our valued customers.” Boulder County officials informed the company on Wednesday that the cement plant, which has operated in Lyons since the 1960s, must close because traffic to and from the facility has increased in recent years to such an extent that the property is no longer in compliance with land-use regulations. “Boulder County has today issued a termination notice to Cemex Inc. requiring the company to cease operations at its Lyons cement plant,” Boulder County community planning and permitting director Dale Case said in a prepared statement Wednesday afternoon. “After a thorough investigation, we have determined that additional traffic at the plant has expanded Cemex operations.” This concept of “expanded operations” at the site is important for understanding the county’s decision to force the plant’s closure. Cemex’s roughly 866-acre property is an agricultural zoning district, which, according to Boulder County’s land-use code, does not allow cement plants as a permitted use. Because the plant has existed longer than the code, its operations have essentially been grandfathered into compliance. However, if it is determined that such a property has expanded its nonconforming operations, county regulators can shut down the site. According to a letter Case sent to Cemex executives on Wednesday, the Cemex operations in Lyons were considered to have expanded as a result of traffic to and from the 5134 Ute Highway plant more than doubling after Cemex was forced in 2022 to stop mining at the Dowe Flats Quarry, which provided raw materials for cement production at the Lyons facility. Presumably, Cemex began trucking in more materials when it could no longer source them from the nearby Dowe Flats Quarry. “In December of 2022, in response to complaints by members of the public, the Colorado Department of Transportation approached Cemex to investigate a potential violation of its state access permit due to increases in truck traffic,” Case’s letter said. “CDOT required Cemex to provide an updated traffic study to determine if a new access permit was required.” The study that Cemex commissioned to satisfy CDOT’s request “demonstrates a more intensive level of truck traffic since the quarry closure,” Case’s letter said. Average daily trips to and from the facility in June 2022 were fewer...",-3
