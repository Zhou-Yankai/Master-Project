"Apple’s $3,499 Vision Pro AR headset to hit shelves in February ",2024-01-08T17:14:16+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/01/08/business/apples-3499-vision-pro-ar-headset-to-hit-shelves-in-february/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Apple said Monday its Vision Pro device will be available in the US from Feb. 2, months after it was launched to capture an augmented-reality (AR) headset market dominated by Facebook-parent Meta Platforms. Vision Pro is Apple’s most expensive bet since the launch of the iPhone more than a decade ago. The AR headset starts at $3,499 and costs more than thrice as much as the priciest headset in Meta’s line of mixed and virtual reality devices. Apple’s Vision Pro can be pre-ordered starting Jan. 19 at 8 a.m. EST, the company said. The device uses a new chip called R1 that will process information from its sensors in less time than the blink of an eye. The headset will test a market crowded with devices that are yet to gain traction among consumers, and put it in direct competition with Meta after years of clashes between the companies over issues like user privacy and control of developer platforms. The device must be plugged to a power source at all times. Apple said it tried to reduce the headset weight with an external battery, which can run up to 2 hours. Meta’s top-of-the-line Quest Pro mixed reality device, which blends virtual reality with the real world video feed, offers about two hours of battery life directly on the headset, without an external battery pack. Apple launched a new series of iPhones with a titanium shell, a faster chip and improved abilities to play video games, in September, but did not raise prices amid a global smartphone slump.",-2

			Trending:		 Thanks to the internet, you no longer have to travel to someplace like Vegas or find a home game, as there are thousands of online poker sites that are just a click away! That doesn’t mean that the poker site itself will be safe, though — so how do you find the best poker sites worth of your time and money? Below, we’ve ranked the best and most reliable online poker sites on the internet today, so you can decide which one you can trust the next time you feel the urge to shuffle up and deal. America’s Cardroom took the crown, but there are more top poker sites worth exploring. Let’s begin. Heads up about our links! Adblock might get confused so please disable it if you have any issues.  If you’re worried about your financial safety while playing online, America’s Cardroom has your back. They use bank-grade encryption standards to safeguard your information, and their security team regularly sweeps for bots, reducing the risk you’ll be cheated at the tables. It’s not just the site’s security that earns it a spot on this list, however. Their banking options are quite varied, and most payouts (with the exception of checks and some e-wallets) are processed in less than a day. They host an array of online poker rooms including Texas Hold’em, Omaha Hold’em, Omaha Hi-Lo, Seven Card Stud, and Blitz Poker. This ensures that players of all preferences and skill levels will find a game that suits their style. Adding to the excitement, America’s Cardroom guarantees $12 million in weekly pools. They host an extensive daily schedule of tournaments, including regular Sit-and-Gos (SNGs), Multi Table Tournaments (MTTs), and a weekly $1 million Guaranteed Tournament (GTD). If you want to play anything other than no-limit hold ‘em, though, this isn’t the place to do it. There’s little Omaha action outside the micro limits, and you’ll rarely see a stud game running. > $2,000 welcome offer [America’s Cardroom Casino]  Grinders will find a welcome home at Black Chip Poker Casino, as it’s one of the most pro-friendly sites around. They offer $3.8 million in weekly tourney guarantees (and there are a lot of tourneys to enter), and they proudly allow HUDs and hand trackers. Gamblers will find a lot to love here as well — most notably their bomb pot tables. At these tables, 4 times per hour a set amount will be deducted from each player’s stack, creating a massive pot. The action will then fast-forward to the flop, with the entire table entered with whatever hole cards they were dealt. Their banking options are a mixed bag. They boast quick processing times and offer a free check payout every month, but they assess a whopping 10% fee on some credit card deposits. >> Join bomb pot tables now [Black Chip Poker Casino]  Ignition Casino does an excellent job of threading the needle between being newbie-friendly and being the type of...",0
"Sunglass-style augmented reality glasses unveiled, will compete with Apple Vision Pro",2024-01-08T14:02:02+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/95374/sunglass-style-augmented-reality-glasses-unveiled-will-compete-with-apple-vision-pro/index.html,"XREAL, an augmented reality (AR) company that is concentrating its efforts on glasses, has announced that a new pair of AR sunglasses is hitting the market. Introducing Air 2 Ultra priced at $699. Air 2 Ultra can currently be ordered by developers, who are expected to receive their shipment sometime in March. XREAL's latest offering is the most recent device to start competing with the Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro. As for what the Air 2 Ultra can do, the company explains via a press release that the sunglasses feature ""spatial computing,"" which projects a floating image in front of the users' eyes, and with its dual 3D cameras located on each side of the glasses it's mapping the environment surrounding the user, while simultaneously tracking hand movement. Notably, the Air 2 Ultra features a full six degrees of freedom or 6DOF tracking. The Air 2 Ultra provides a 56-degree field of view, 500 nits of brightness, and a 1080p screen at a 120Hz refresh rate for each eye. The weight of the AR sunglasses is 80 grams, and they come with a range of connectivity options, with support for macOS, Windows, Samsung Android phones, and the iPhone 15.

Will the Magnificent 7 make investors richer in 2024?,2024-01-07T10:17:58+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/investing/article-12933223/Will-Magnificent-7-make-investors-richer-2024.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490,"By Rachel Rickard Straus   Updated:  14:14, 8 January 2024      21 View  comments  If your pension or investment account rose in value last year, you may be tempted to credit your own stock and fund-picking prowess or an overall recovery in financial markets. Yet, there is a strong possibility that you owe a sizable proportion of your improved fortunes to just seven companies. These seven are now so valuable – and saw such phenomenal growth in 2023 – that they have been nicknamed the Magnificent Seven. They are all tech companies and household names: Apple, Amazon, Google parent-company Alphabet, Facebook-owner Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. And between them, they are worth more than the stock markets of the UK, Japan, France, China and Canada combined. Together, they were the driving force behind a large proportion of stock market gains last year, rising by 70 per cent on average. The US stock market – as measured by the S&P 500 – rose by 19 per cent in 2023. But if you had extracted these seven stocks from the S&P 500, it would have gained just five per cent. Put simply, if you held these stocks last year, there is a much greater chance that you saw your wealth grow than if you didn't. But as investors review their portfolios for the year ahead, the dominance of this small pool of companies raises a lot of difficult questions. Riding high: They are all tech companies and household names - Apple, Amazon, Google parent-company Alphabet, Facebook-owner Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla Should investors keep ploughing money into them in the hope that their recent success has further to run or should they take profits and shift their attention elsewhere? The Magnificent Seven has seen a slight dip in values this week – is this a blip or the beginning of a reversal in fortunes? Are investors who have enjoyed substantial gains from these companies now too reliant on them? And is there another sector that is due this type of surge in fortunes? Wealth investigates. Although they have very different business models, all seven have one thing in common: they stand to profit from the growth of Artificial Intelligence. For example, Microsoft is rolling out its AI Co-pilot software this year; Meta will be able to use AI to better target its users with advertising; and Nvidia makes software used for AI. But that alone does not account for their rapid growth last year – the market conditions were also instrumental. That is because the value of these companies is based not just on the returns they are producing today, but also expectations of their earnings way into the future. When inflation and interest rates are high – as they were in 2022 – the value of these future earnings diminishes because they are being eaten away by high inflation. So, when inflation and interest rates started to fall last year, the value of these future earnings grew.

But the database, accessed by Reuters on Wednesday, still includes X (formerly Twitter) and Twitch, with fines totalling 51 million roubles ($560,730) and 23 million roubles ($252,879), respectively. Google, Meta, TikTok and Telegram did not immediately respond to requests for comment. State bailiffs could not immediately be reached. Russia has been at loggerheads with foreign technology companies over what it deems unlawful content and a failure to store user data locally, in simmering disputes that intensified after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Following the invasion, Twitter and Meta Platforms’ Facebook and Instagram were blocked, and Google-owned YouTube became a particular target of the Russian state’s ire. In late 2023, a Russian court imposed a fine against Google of 4.6 billion roubles ($50.4 million), calculated as a proportion of its annual turnover in Russia. Meta, which was labelled as “extremist” in 2022, has also been subjected to fines as a proportion of its Russian revenue.

A current funny storyline involving wrestling manager Stokely Hathaway has somehow leaped all the possible boundaries, going a bit meta. The storyline took a bizarrely funny turn when WWE Hall of Famer Kurt Angle got roped in it. A clip that featured Kurt Angle was posted by Hathaway on his X (formerly Twitter) account. In the clip, Angle was seen urging Tony Khan and AEW’s Kris Statlander and Willow Nightingale to give the 33-year-old manager a chance to prove his worth. Angle started by saying that he did not like how his “boy” was being treated at AEW. He then added that instead of going to Japan with Jon Moxley for a match, Hathaway decided to stay here to watch the tag team perform at the AEW Rampage. Angle, referring to Hathaway, added, “2024 is for the short, bald kings with a so-so credit score.” ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad #GiveStokelyAChance@willowwrestles / @callmekrisstat @AEW pic.twitter.com/huD93xg2rd — Big Stoke (@StokelyHathaway) January 6, 2024  He also added that Hathaway is a changed man now and the tag team should give him a chance.

As the two were introduced, Hathaway was seen flattering Statlander with compliments. However, he decided not to bombard compliments on her tag team partner Nightingale.

Glatað að vera niður­lægður á al­manna­færi,2024-01-06T19:00:12+00:00,https://www.visir.is/g/20242511526d/glatad-ad-vera-nidurlaegdur-a-almannafaeri,"Má Gunnarssyni og leiðsöguhundi hans var meinaður aðgangur að Langbest í Keflavík vegna stefnu veitingastaðarins um að leyfa ekki gæludýr. Forsvarsmenn Langbest bera fyrir sig vanþekkingu á lögum um leiðsöguhunda og hafa beðið Má afsökunar. Már segir glatað að vera niðurlægður á þennan máta en kann að meta skjót viðbrögð staðarins. Langbest birti færslu á Facebook-síðu sinni fyrr í dag þar sem þau greindu frá atvikinu. „Það atvik gerðist á veitingastað okkar að blindur einstaklingur kom til okkar ásamt leiðsöguhundi sínum. Á Langbest er það yfirlýst stefna að gæludýr eru ekki leyfð yfir höfuð og því varð uppi fótur og fit hvort gefa ætti undanþágu vegna þessa aðstæðna,“ segir í færslunni. „Satt best að segja þá vorum við á Langbest illa upplýst um að það væru lög í landinu sem banna að aðskilja leiðsöguhunda frá eigendum sínum og hikuðum við að bjóða hann velkominn á staðinn. Við það yfirgáfu þessir gestir staðinn okkar verulega ósáttir, skiljanlega,“ segir jafnframt. „Af því tilefni viljum við öll á Langbest biðjast afsökunar á þessum mistökum okkar og viljum að það komi skýrt fram að allir leiðsöguhundar blindra einstaklinga eru velkomnir á veitingastað okkar. Það er mikilvægt að koma þessum skilaboðum á framfæri sem víðast þannig að sem flestir séu upplýstir um þessi mál,“ segir að lokum í færslunni. Þegar skoðað er hverjir hafa deilt færslu Langbest kemur í ljós að Már Gunnarsson, Ólympíufari og söngvari, er sá sem lenti í þessu leiðinlega atviki. Már sem hefur áður talað hispurslaust um reynslu sína af því að vera blindur einstaklingur deildi færslunni fyrir skömmu og greinir frá sinni hlið af atvikinu. „Nú fyrir helgi gerðist það í fyrsta skipti á Íslandi að mér og leiðsöguhundinum Max var meinaður aðgangur að veitingarstað. Við fjölskyldan höfðum hugsað okkur að eiga saman ánægjulega stund áður enn ég færi aftur út til Englands en augljóslega settu þessar móttökur strik í reikninginn!“ skrifar hann í færslunni. „Það er eitt að þetta er í ósamræði við lög, en tilfinningalega er það glatað að fá svona höfnun og niðurlægingu á almannafæri í andlitið þegar maður er að gera sitt besta að lifa eðlilegu og sjálfstæðu lífi sem blindur einstaklingur!“ segir Már jafnframt. Már segist hafa fengið hringingu frá eiganda Langbest snemma morguns daginn eftir atvikið. Hann hafi verið miður sín yfir atvikinu og beðist innilega afsökunar fyrir hönd staðarins. Enn fremur vildi eigandinn koma skilaboðum á framfæri svo aðrir veitingastaðir myndu læra af mistökum þeirra. „Ég kann að meta þessi skjótu viðbrögð og hlakka til að mæta með Max á Langbest, fá mér m.a brauðstangir þegar ég verð á landinu næst!“ skrifar Már að lokum. 
Ekki náðist í Langbest við skrif fréttarinnar.
 Sundkappinn söngelski Már Gunnarsson segist gríðarlega ánægður með þjónustu Play í flugi sínu heim til landsins í dag. Hann og hundurinn hans Max voru kampakátir og segja það hafa verið besta flug þeirra til þessa. Már Gunnarsson, söngvari og námsmaður, þarf að borga háan kostnað í hvert ski...",0

Who's afraid of VR? I am. It made me queasy - until I tried Meta Quest 3,2024-01-05T17:31:00+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/whos-afraid-of-vr-i-am-it-made-me-queasy-until-i-tried-meta-quest-3/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular 'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean? ZDNET's recommendations are based on many hours of testing, research, and comparison shopping. We gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites. And we pore over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the products and services we’re assessing. When you click through from our site to a retailer and buy a product or service, we may earn affiliate commissions. This helps support our work, but does not affect what we cover or how, and it does not affect the price you pay. Neither ZDNET nor the author are compensated for these independent reviews.  Indeed, we follow strict guidelines that ensure our editorial content is never influenced by advertisers. ZDNET's editorial team writes on behalf of you, our reader. Our goal is to deliver the most accurate information and the most knowledgeable advice possible in order to help you make smarter buying decisions on tech gear and a wide array of products and services. Our editors  thoroughly review and fact-check every article to ensure that our content meets the highest standards. If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form. If you've been paying any attention at all to ZDNET for the past half year or so, you know that one of the trends we find most intriguing is XR, the acronym used because AR/VR/MR (for augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality) is just too cumbersome. Like generative AI, XR in 2023 has become usable and potentially practical to an audience wider than enthusiasts, early adopters, and researchers.  Also: Would you believe a VR headset outsold AirPods during Black Friday?  In fact, just last week, we named the Meta Quest 3, a $500 XR headset, as ZDNET's Product of the Year for 2023. If, in January of 2023, you'd told me that a consumer VR headset -- from Facebook of all companies -- was going to be our top pick, I would have mocked you. But now, after my first experiences with the Quest 3, I have to concur. The Meta Quest 3 is a game-changer. I'm not yet entirely sure what areas of technology use this device is going to change -- but change things it will.  I've been tracking the technology behind VR for years, but with one limited exception, I never used it until just recently. That's because -- as the title says -- I'm a claustrophobic guy with glasses who is very prone to motion sickness. I can't even play first-person shooters for more than a few minutes without hosting a gastric rebellion. My one previous VR experience was at a place called Magic Edge in Mountain View, California, where they put flight simulators inside actual moving plane cockpit mockups. I did not do well. So, I've been putting off trying out VR headsets until now. Reports are t...",3

Apple Vision Pro vs. Meta Quest 3: What's the difference?,2024-01-05T12:02:18+00:00,https://www.pocket-lint.com/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3/,无法获取内容,0
"Meta Quest 2 is back at its Black Friday price, permanently",2024-01-05T11:51:40+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/meta-quest-2-vr-headset-january-2024/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? If you weren’t able to buy the Meta Quest 2 with a discount during Black Friday, don’t worry because the standalone virtual reality headset’s price has been permanently lowered. The 128GB model was $249 during the shopping holiday instead of $300, and that $51 discount is here to stay. If you want to see what VR is all about, this is the device that you’ll want to buy. However, even though the lowered price isn’t temporary, it’s still highly recommended that you proceed with the purchase as soon as possible as the influx of interest may cause stocks to run out.  The price drop for the Meta Quest 2 follows the launch of its successor, the Meta Quest 3, in October 2023, but it remains one of the best ways to enjoy virtual reality. While our Meta Quest 3 versus Meta Quest 2 comparison understandably highlights the upgrades in the newer version of the VR headset, those come with the drawback of a higher price. The Meta Quest 2, however, will let you play the same games and run the same apps at a lower price — if you check out our roundup of the best Meta Quest 2 games, you’ll surely find something that you’ll like. As a standalone VR headset, the Meta Quest 2 doesn’t need to be connected to a computer and doesn’t require you to set up base stations. There are no wires or cables — just put on the headset and dive directly into virtual worlds after setting your designated play space. You’ll experience complete immersion with 3D positional audio, hand tracking, and movement tracking, and the included Intuitive Touch controllers are very natural to use. These are just some of the reasons why the Meta Quest 2 remains in our list of the best VR headsets as our top budget option. You don’t need to invest in expensive gaming PC deals to jump into virtual reality if you take advantage of the price drop for the Meta Quest 2. The 128GB model is permanently down to $249 from $300, but while the $51 in savings isn’t going away, you’ll want to purchase the standalone VR headset now while it’s still widely available. We expect the Meta Quest 2 to start flying off the shelves with this discount, so you should secure your own unit before it starts to get hard to find stocks.  If you want a top-tier display to go with your gaming PC, check out the 34-inch LG UltraGear QHD curved gaming monitor. Not only will it be a worthy screen for your powerful gaming desktop, but it's also currently on sale from Walmart with a $471 discount that nearly halves its price to just $529 from $1,000. We're not sure how much time is remaining before this offer expires, but like most monitor deals of this caliber, it will probably end sooner than you think. Buy it now if you don't want to miss out. Why you should buy the 34-inch LG UltraGear QHD curved gaming monitor
Gamers who are playing the best PC games should have a screen that will let you appreciate modern graphics. That's certainly the case ...",2

2024 will be ‘The year of AI glasses’,2024-01-05T11:00:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3711844/2024-will-be-the-year-of-ai-glasses.html#tk.rss_all," Apple’s pricey Vision Pro augmented reality platform is expected to arrive in the first quarter of 2024. But by the end of the year, I predict the platform of the year will be — drum roll, please — AI glasses! Wait, what? That’s right. Glasses that let you interact with artificial intelligence (AI) from the comfort of your own face will be the sleeper hit of the year. In fact, the buzz around market leader Meta has already begun. Announced in September and shipped in October, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses arrival was initially received with a collective shrug. They were assumed to be camera glasses, like Snap Spectacles, or virtual assistant glasses, like Amazon’s Echo Frames. Or, for that matter, a small upgrade from their Meta predecessor, Ray-Ban Stories. But Spectacles, Echo Frames and Ray-Ban Stories failed to thrill the gadget-loving public. It took a while for everyone to learn that Ray-Ban Meta glasses, which start at $299, are orders of magnitude better and more powerful than any of these lackluster gadgets; they offer a much better camera, super high-quality audio, the ability to live-stream to social, and an incredibly good AI assistant. (Here’s a look at the camera quality via my own photos and a video.) Despite the lackluster launch, Ray-Ban Meta glasses started blowing up online in December when three things happened. First, Meta announced a kind of closed beta of its “multimodal” feature. While users could conjure up the Meta Assistant at any time using the “Hey, Meta” command, the “multimodal” feature adds a “look” command that sends a picture taken through the glasses’ camera to the Meta Assistant for processing and analysis. You can tell your glasses to look at a table full of ingredients and condiments and give you a recipe for using those items, for example — all hands-free.  The combination of both spoken and visual interaction with Meta’s powerful AI is mind-blowing and conspicuously world-changing. Second, tech journalists started forming a consensus that Ray-Ban Meta glasses are actually transformative. Though I was praising them way back in October, a critical mass of my colleagues really started getting excited about them only last month. Mashable’s Kimberly Gedeon said: “The Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses shocked me, in a good way.” 9to5Mac’s Filipe Espósito wrote, “Ray-Ban Meta glasses convinced me to believe in smart glasses.” C|NET’s Scott Stein said (about the “multi-modal” feature) that “the demo wowed me because I had never seen anything like it.” Third, Ray-Ban Meta videos started taking off on TikTok and other social networks (even though the glasses’ live-streaming feature supported only Facebook and Instagram). Several AI glasses products are already on the market. For example, Lucyd Lyte Smart Eyewear Powered with ChatGPT was announced in August. The glasses are inexpensive, but of fatally low quality — especially the sound quality — according to reviewers. Another product, the Solos AirGo 3, also provides access to ...",3

Samsung and Google are making XR headsets to rival Apple Vision Pro,2024-01-04T20:26:11+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/samsung-and-google-are-making-xr-headsets-to-rival-apple-vision-pro-4405754,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience. If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. Qualcomm has announced a new chip for mixed reality headsets, which will power big name alternatives to Apple’s forthcoming Vision Pro. The new Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 is the updated version of the chip currently being used in Meta Quest 3 mixed reality headset. It will be used within forthcoming and as-yet-unannounced devices from Samsung and Google, the company says. iPhone 15 with unlimited data on a top network The iPhone 15 for £31 a month with unlimited data on Vodafone is a great deal even with the upfront cost of £270.
 The iPhone 15 for £31 a month with unlimited data on Vodafone is a great deal even with the upfront cost of £270. The newest chipset will mean better screens with improved graphics performance overall, Qualcomm says. CPU performance is up 20% and GPU performance is up 15% in mixed and virtual reality. “The Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 supports 4.3K per eye resolution and 12 or more concurrent cameras to deliver crisp, immersive mixed reality (MR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences,” Qualcomm says in a press release. That’ll translate into massive productivity and entertainment gains with “spectacularly clear visuals” with screens the size of the room, and spatial computing in 4K. Those 12 cameras will work “with powerful on-device AI, Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2-powered devices can effortlessly track the user, their movements, and the world around them for effortless navigation and unparalleled experiences that merge physical and digital spaces.” Having Google and Samsung on board suggests it won’t be long before we see announcements from both companies in the near future, pertaining to their own hardware. “Samsung is thrilled to collaborate with Qualcomm Technologies and Google in revolutionising the mobile industry once more,” Samsung VP Inkang Song said. “With Samsung’s mobile expertise and our joint commitment, we aim to create the best-in-class XR experience for Galaxy users.” “We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Qualcomm Technologies and Samsung on the future of immersive and spatial XR,” said Shahram Izadi, vice president of AR at Google. “We’re excited for the Android ecosystem to take advantage of Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2’s capabilities and enable new experiences.”

Mark Zuckerberg sold Meta shares worth $428M to close out 2023: filing,2024-01-04T15:42:50+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/01/04/business/mark-zuckerberg-sold-meta-shares-worth-428m-to-end-2023/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg pocketed nearly half a billion dollars after selling his company’s shares nearly every day during the last two months of 2023 — a move that coincided with a massive rebound in the Facebook and Instagram parent’s stock price. The Facebook founder sold a total of nearly 1.28 million shares to secure a $428 million windfall amid Meta’s 194% spike last year, according to regulatory filings this week.  It was the first time that Zuckerberg sold stock since November 2021, according to Bloomberg, which first reported on the moves. Even after the sales, Zuckerberg still owns about 13% of Meta shares, the outlet said. His personal fortune is estimated to be $125 billion, placing him seventh on Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. The IRS will take a significant chunk of Zuckerberg’s proceeds. The billionaire’s stock sales are subject to the federal capital gains tax of approximately 24%, as well as an additional 13.3% state tax in California, where Zuckerberg maintains a $37 million estate. Meta shares slumped to a seven-year low in 2022 as Zuckerberg spent billions on a widely panned shift toward the metaverse.  But the company rebounded last year as the executive ordered a major cost-cutting spree that included thousands of layoffs and shifted company resources toward the artificial intelligence boom. Meta shares were flat in trading Thursday.  The Post has reached out to Meta for comment. Meta is one of the so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks that drove a major stock market rally to close out last year. The company’s stock sputtered a bit in early December when news of Zuckerberg’s selling spree first surfaced, but they still finished more than 5% higher for the full month. It’s unclear if Zuckerberg has a specific plan in mind for the cash. In December, the tech outlet Wired reported that Zuckerberg was building a massive $100 million compound on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. The secretive complex reportedly includes an underground bunker, at least 30 bedrooms and bathrooms and comes equipped with its own food and energy sources. Zuckerberg has also spent plenty of time and money of his favorite pastime of mixed martial arts training — even winning two medals at his first-ever Brazilian jiu-jitsu tournament last May.  At one point, Zuckerberg challenged fellow tech billionaire Elon Musk to a “cage match,” but the bout never materialized. Zuckerberg’s athletic ambitions were dealt a setback in November after he tore his ACL during training. The injury required surgery.",-2
Facebook’s new Link History feature has a privacy catch,2024-01-04T10:59:33+00:00,https://mybroadband.co.za/news/internet/520701-facebooks-new-link-history-feature-has-a-privacy-catch.html,"MyBroadband Facebook’s new “Link History” feature on its mobile app allows its parent company, Meta Platforms, to see which websites you visit to better target you with personalised ads across its services. Earlier this week, Meta punted the feature as a useful addition for users to see their browsing activity in one place rather than having to keep tabs on their actions themselves. Link History provides a summary of all the external browser links you clicked on from within Facebook. However, Gizmodo cautioned that the pop-up encouraging users to enable Link History includes a line mentioning that Meta might use users’ information to improve its ads. “When you allow link history, we may use your information to improve your ads across Meta technologies,” Meta states. In addition, the pop-up has the Link History toggle switched to on by default, which could steer less observant users towards accepting something they might not fully understand. To disable Link History on your Facebook account, click on any browser link in the Facebook app and tap the three-dot menu in the in-app browser. From here, you must select the “Go to settings” option and disable “Allow link history” in the Browser Settings section. When prompted, tap the “Don’t allow” button. Link history is also available on Instagram and can be disabled in a similar way as on Facebook. While both apps will immediately delete your entire link history, Meta mentions it might take up to 90 days to “complete the deletion process”. facebook Headline Instagram Meta Platforms online privacy social media Comments section policy: MyBroadband has a new article comments policy which aims to encourage constructive discussions.

Yet another serious competitor to the Vision Pro takes shape,2024-01-16T23:14:34+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/lg-xr-headset-meta-quest-pro-2-answer-to-the-apple-vision-pro/,"Following rumors of a new extended reality (XR) headset, LG CEO Cho Joo-wan made the news official, confirming it could arrive as early as 2025. It wasn’t clear if this would be an LG branded product or if the headset is made in partnership with another company, such as Meta, but the timing is right to launch an Apple Vision Pro competitor. LG isn’t new to XR, but its last VR headset was released seven years ago. This makes it seem unlikely that the company known for TVs and supplying advanced display technology to Apple and other manufacturers would suddenly return to this abandoned product category. LG is a leader in screen technology that has made super-bright TVs and transparent displays possible. These recent advancements, shown at CES 2024, make it clear LG is still pushing the limits of what’s possible. An LG breakthrough in XR displays could give competitors a way to challenge Apple’s Vision Pro, which features remarkably crisp 4K-per-eye screen resolution. To add weight to the possibility of a second-generation Meta Quest Pro headset, rumors and leaks have suggested a partnership between LG and Meta as far back as 2022. While Meta’s 2022 Quest Pro didn’t sell well, it was the first attempt at a work-centric VR headset with mixed reality capabilities, aka XR. In 2024, the interest in XR has skyrocketed. Even smart glasses manufacturers like Xreal and RayNeo are launching more affordable solutions amid Apple’s entry into the market. The Mac computer manufacturer rebranded its XR headset as a spatial computer, changing expectations for the Vision Pro. It seems likely that Meta will want to join in with a direct competitor rather than expect its $500 Quest 3 mixed reality headset to stand up to the superior displays and performance of the $3,500 Vision Pro. If Meta does launch a new high-end headset, naming it the Quest Pro 2 would be most logical, but riding the wave of love for the Quest 3 could lead to branding it as a Quest 3 Pro. To be clear, LG made no reference to Meta in The Guru, a Korean-language news source that reported the news. Meta hasn’t shared its plans for the future beyond the metaverse company’s ongoing commitment and funding to make AR and VR the technology of the future. A new study on virtual reality comfort suggests that some of the best VR headsets have a feature that can help prevent motion sickness. Also known as simulator sickness, the problem is due to a mismatch between what you see in a head-mounted display (HMD) and what your body feels in reality. It’s well known that gamers prefer higher frames per second (fps) to be able to react more quickly and aim with greater accuracy. According to a recent study, though, a faster refresh rate can also reduce the chances you’ll experience nausea or vertigo after playing a VR game with lots of motion. You don't normally see tech titans like Nvidia and Apple pair up, but the two companies announced at this week's Nvidia GTC 2024 that they are coming together around the Vi...",2
Mark Zuckerberg to be deposed in Texas suit targeting Meta of ‘secretly harvesting’ facial recognition without customer consent,2024-01-16T22:01:22+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/01/16/business/mark-zuckerberg-to-be-deposed-in-texas-suit-targeting-meta-of-using-facial-recognition-without-customer-consent/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg will be deposed as part of a Texas lawsuit accusing the Facebook and Instagram parent of using facial recognition technology without customer consent. A Texas state appeals court upheld a lower court’s decision requiring Zuckerberg to give testimony in the case.  The lawsuit, originally filed in 2022, accused Meta of “secretly harvesting” biometric data from its users in violation of state law. The decision was a blow to Meta, which had sought to avoid having its boss deposed. Meanwhile, Texas argued Zuckerberg should be compelled to sit because he has “unique personal knowledge of discoverable information relevant to its claims,” the filing said. Meta did not immediately return a request for comment on the court ruling. Bloomberg was first to report on the decision. The Texas lawsuit alleged that Meta gleaned the biometric data from photos and videos uploaded by users, shared the information with others and then “failed to destroy collected identifiers within a reasonable time.” Texas is said to be seeking hundreds of billions of dollars in civil penalties – with fines of up to $25,000 for every violation of applicable state laws.  Meta has described the suit as “without merit.” When the lawsuit was filed in February 2022, Texas Attorney General Ken Patton accused the company of attempting to “take advantage of people and their children with the intent to turn a profit at the expense of one’s safety and well-being.” In November 2021, the Facebook parent said it would shut down its facial recognition program and proceeded to delete related data for more than a billion users.

"Power Plays: MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META dominate market moves",2024-01-16T12:00:00+00:00,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/power-plays-msft-nvda-googl-meta-dominate-market-moves/," Last week, an interesting picture of triumph was painted in the stock market, with the technology sector taking the lead. Now, this may come as no surprise. The stars of the show were none other than several members of the so-called Magnificent Seven – Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta. It was primarily thanks to these titans of the global markets that clear outperformance was achieved in their participating industries. Considering their capitalization, these four members of the magnificent seven outperformed in the sector and their industries, helping the overall market close the week up an impressive 1.87%. Thanks to that dominant performance, the market has swung to positive territory on the year, up almost 0.3%. So, with the first two weeks of the year in the books and witnessing the market seamlessly continuing its momentum from the previous year, one cannot help but wonder – will this trend persist throughout the year? Well, let’s delve deeper into each industry, exploring how these titans of the technology sector have set the stage for outperformance continuation. In the software kingdom, Microsoft NASDAQ: MSFT reigned supreme. Its stock performance spoke volumes, as it closed the week up an impressive 5.63% and overtook Apple NASDAQ: AAPL to become the world's most valuable company.  The dominant performance came after the stock broke out of its multi-month consolidation and traded to a new all-time high of $390.68. Analysts continue to favor the software giant, placing a Moderate Buy rating and price target forecasting further upside.  Notably, as the breakout experienced momentum, two analysts took bullish action on the stock. BMO Capital Markets increased its price target from $400 to $420, and Piper Sandler reiterated its rating of Overweight with a $455 price target. The semiconductor industry experienced notable relative strength last week, with the VanEck Semiconductor ETF NASDAQ: SMH closing the week up an impressive 4.14%. Surprise, surprise, its dominant industry player and top holding Nvidia NASDAQ: NVDA stole the spotlight. Nvidia’s stellar performance last week once again highlighted the crucial role of semiconductors in powering modern technology, making it one of the key players to watch this year.  Like Microsoft, Nvidia broke out of a multi-month consolidation last week and experienced terrific momentum and an uptick in volume. As a result of breaking above significant resistance at $500, the stock closed the week up over 11% and achieved a new all-time high of $553.46. Now, turning our attention to the internet content and information industry, Alphabet NASDAQ: GOOGL and Meta Platforms NASDAQ: META stood out for their dominance. Alphabet, Google's parent company, oversees YouTube, Waymo, Mandiant, and various subsidiaries, dominating online search with over 90% of the market. Meta, formerly Facebook, rebranded in 2021, focusing on the metaverse and fostering social interaction across applications like Instagram and ...",3

Is the “Old” MrBeast Still Missed? Fans Debate Over the Internet,2024-01-14T17:07:49+00:00,https://www.essentiallysports.com/gaming-news-is-the-old-mrbeast-still-missed-fans-debate-over-the-internet/,"Latest NBA NFL NASCAR Golf Tennis ES Fancast Latest NBA NFL NASCAR Golf Tennis ES Fancast Follow Us Starting his career in 2012, Jimmy MrBeast Donaldson has evolved with his content as YouTube has. Known to set the new YouTube meta, he has grown from the young creator he was when he was 13 to one of the biggest figures in the YouTube content space. MrBeast’s first video was quite different from what he makes today. He has come a long way from someone who makes Minecraft videos, to the mega-scale production videos he creates now. Today, being the biggest YouTuber on the platform with over 220 million subscribers, fans have noticed the change in his style of videos over the years. While fans love the content that he is currently putting out, many miss the younger MrBeast. The charm of his younger version growing his way in the YouTube world is something that initially captivated the fans before everything went big budget. And a post on Reddit has many fans debating over which MrBeast they like more. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In a recent Reddit post, one fan spoke about how they were watching MrBeast videos from over 4 years ago and pointed out all the changes they noticed over the years. Through a post titled, ” I miss the ‘old’ MrBeast,” the fan said, ” It used to be more about him and his crew doing challenges and having fun.” In contrast, they mentioned, “Now it’s less about him or the crew, and more about the challenge and what you win. The people competing are different in every video so you can’t really build a connection with them.” I miss the “old” MrBeast byu/ThatLazyFinnishGuy inMrBeast  The fan discussed how Chandler, a close friend of MrBeast, who used to be a big part of the channel, is now “barely” there in the videos. The fan shared how they can’t pinpoint when the change started happening in MrBeast’s content, but does mention that it was around after Jake the Viking left the team.

While his focus was always on YouTube and it looks like it will always be YouTube, Jimmy has transitioned with the platform and the audience. The fan shared how the post is just their opinion on the matter and went on to ask the community what they felt about MrBeast’s content over the years. One user stated that while he likes MrBeast’s current content, he wishes the YouTuber, “he still did those challenges with his crew aswell.” Comment byu/ThatLazyFinnishGuy from discussion inMrBeast  Another user agrees. While they like MrBeast’s videos and appreciate the effort that goes into making them, they find his current content, “kind of boring,” but can’t pinpoint why.

HEDGEFLOW Hedge funds hunt new ‘magnificent’ tech stocks,2024-01-14T09:51:16+00:00,https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/01/14/hedgeflow-hedge-funds-hunt-new-magnificent-tech-stocks/,"April 3, 2024 April 3, 2024 April 3, 2024 April 3, 2024 April 4, 2024 April 3, 2024 April 2, 2024 March 31, 2024 April 3, 2024 March 28, 2024 March 20, 2024 March 8, 2024 April 3, 2024 April 3, 2024 April 3, 2024 April 2, 2024 April 3, 2024 April 3, 2024 April 3, 2024 April 2, 2024 April 2, 2024 March 15, 2024 March 15, 2024 March 9, 2024 February 26, 2024 February 24, 2024 Global hedge funds have reduced their exposure to the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks while increasing their allocation to other technology, media and telecommunications (TMT) companies, according to Morgan Stanley (MS.N). Last year, the magnificent seven group of stocks — Nvidia (NVDA.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Tesla (TSLA.O), Google-parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Meta Platforms (META.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O) — drove a market rally. Individually, they soared between around 50 per cent and 240 per cent in 2023, making them among the market’s most rewarding bets. Most continue to post gains this year, although Tesla and Apple are down roughly 12 per cent and 3.5 per cent, respectively. Morgan Stanley’s prime brokerage content team, which provides financing services to institutional investors, said hedge funds have added long positions to TMT each session since the beginning of the year, accelerating most recently, in what the bank calls as a “broadening” effect. Overall, the bank said exposure to non-Magnificent Seven TMT stocks is close to record-low levels since 2020. Software and semi-conductor stocks have been the most added sectors, while bets against TMT stocks are across different sectors.

Researchers Use Spinning Metasurfaces To Craft Compact Thermal Imaging System,2024-01-13T23:46:24+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfIwIMNi_8N2Uoy9CZgXDJO,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   Researchers used a stack of spinning metasurface devices to capture spectral and polarization details of thermal radiation as well as the intensity information that is acquired with traditional thermal imaging. CREDIT: Xueji Wang, Purdue University By Eurasia Review  Researchers have developed a new technology that uses meta-optical devices to perform thermal imaging. The approach provides richer information about imaged objects, which could broaden the use of thermal imaging in fields such as autonomous navigation, security, thermography, medical imaging and remote sensing. “Our method overcomes the challenges of traditional spectral thermal imagers, which are often bulky and delicate due to their reliance on large filter wheels or interferometers,” said research team leader Zubin Jacob from Purdue University. “We combined meta-optical devices and cutting-edge computational imaging algorithms to create a system that is both compact and robust while also having a large field of view.” In Optica, Optica Publishing Group’s journal for high-impact research, the authors describe their new spectro-polarimetric decomposition system, which uses a stack of spinning metasurfaces to break down thermal light into its spectral and polarimetric components. This allows the imaging system to capture the spectral and polarization details of thermal radiation in addition to the intensity information that is acquired with traditional thermal imaging. The researchers showed that the new system can be used with a commercial thermal camera to successfully classify various materials, a task that is typically challenging for conventional thermal cameras. The method’s ability to distinguish temperature variations and identify materials based on spectro-polarimetric signatures could help boost safety and efficiency for a variety of applications, including autonomous navigation. “Traditional autonomous navigation approaches rely heavily on RGB cameras, which struggle in challenging conditions like low light or bad weather,” said the paper’s first author Xueji Wang, a postdoctoral researcher at Purdue University. “When integrated with heat-assisted detection and ranging technology, our spectro-polarimetric thermal camera can provide vital information in these difficult scenarios, offering clearer images than RGB or conventional thermal cameras. Once we achieve real-time video capture, the technology could significantly enhance scene perception and overall safety.” Spectro-polarimetric imaging in the long-wave infrared is crucial for applications such as night vision, machine vision, trace gas sensing and thermography. However, today’s spectro-polarimetric long-wave infrared imagers are bulky and limited in spectral resolution and field of view. To overcome these limitations the researchers turned to large-area metasurfaces — ultra-thin structured surfaces that can manipulate light in complex ways.

Novoidentifikovani geni za depresiju mogu dovesti do novih tretmana,2024-01-13T21:52:23+00:00,https://nauka.telegraf.rs/medicina/3817969-novoidentifikovani-geni-za-depresiju-mogu-dovesti-do-novih-tretmana,"Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min.

Istraživanje predvođeno Londonskim univerzitetskim koledžom otkrilo je više od 50 novih genetskih lokacija (specifičnih pozicija na hromozomu) i 205 novih gena povezanih sa depresijom, u prvoj globalnoj studiji genetike ozbiljne depresije kod učesnika iz grupa različitog porekla, piše UCL. Studija takođe prikazuje potencijal za izmenjenu namenu lekova, pošto jedan od identifikovanih gena kodira protein koji je meta uobičajenog leka za dijabetes, ukazujući takođe na nove mete za lekove koji bi mogli biti razvijeni radi tretiranja depresije. Depresija je veoma uobičajena, ali se ipak malo zna kako se razvija. Genetsko istraživanje pomoću ogromne količine podataka omogućava nove puteve za razumevanje te bolesti i otkrilo je desetine gena povezanih sa depresijom, od kojih svaki posebno samo malo povećava rizik. Takođe se mogu pronaći nove mete za lekove, ali se zasad istraživanje uglavnom fokusiralo na ljude evropskog porekla, što istraživači smatraju velikim nedostatkom, naročito u pogledu tako složenog stanja kao što je depresija. Nova studija je obuhvatila skoro milion osoba afričkog, istočnoazijskog, južnoazijskog i hispano/latino američkog porekla, uključujući 88.316 osoba sa teškom depresijom. Napravljeni su veliki pomaci u identifikaciji gena povezanih sa rizikom od depresije, otkrivajući nove veze i jačajući ranije dokaze, a neki geni pokazuju potencijal za razvoj lekova, kao što je NDUFAF3. NDUFAF3 kodira protein koji je ranije doveden u vezu sa promenljivim raspoloženjem (afektivnim poremećajem), i meta je metformina, standardnog leka za tretiranje dijabetesa tipa 2. Ispitivanja metformina na životinjama sugerišu moguću povezanost sa smanjenom depresijom i anksioznošću, tako da ovaj najnoviji nalaz dodatno ukazuje na potrebu za daljim proučavanjem metformina i depresije. Ostali identifikovani geni možda imaju biološki verovatne veze sa depresijom, poput gena povezanog sa neurotransmiterom uključenim u ponašanje određeno ciljevima, i gena koji kodiraju vrstu proteina ranije povezanu sa više neuroloških stanja. Začudo, istraživači su pronašli manje preklapanja u genima za depresiju kod grupa sa različitim poreklom nego što su očekivali – na nivou od oko 30% (mereći koliko je genetska asocijacija kod jedne grupe primenljiva na drugu grupu), što je manje nego što je ranije otkriveno za druge osobine i bolesti. Stoga je još važnije izučavati depresiju u raznovrsnim uzorcima pošto su neki od nalaza možda specifični za određeno poreklo. Razumevanje složenih bolesti poput depresije ostaće nepotpuno dok ne prevaziđemo evrocentičnu pristranost u istraživanju genetike i ne tražimo uzroke kod različitih naroda širom sveta, kažu autori studije. Mnogi geni ranije povezani sa rizikom od depresije možda imaju dejstvo samo kod ljudi evropskog porekla, tako da je bitno da genetski podaci budu primereno raznorodni kako bi genetsko istraživanje doprinelo novim lekovima koji mogu pomoći lj...",0

I was 'gang raped' in the metaverse -the trauma was similar to a real-world assault,2024-01-13T17:57:15+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-12948027/I-gang-raped-metaverse-trauma-similar-real-world-assault.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490,"By Rob Waugh Tech Correspondent For Dailymail.Com   Published:  12:44, 13 January 2024   |  Updated:  17:57, 13 January 2024      201 View  comments  A woman has revealed she was 'virtually gang raped'  by four male avatars in Meta's Horizon Worlds - and she said the trauma is similar to a real-world assault. Speaking to DailyMail.com, psychotherapist and start-up co-founder Nina Patel said that her attackers may have felt ‘disinhibited’ due to being in a virtual world. While she does not know the attacker's true identities, all four had male voices - and one even said to her, 'Don’t pretend you didn’t love it' after the attack. Patel told DailyMail.com that the 'distressing experience' happened just 60 seconds after joining the Meta-owned virtual world - a shared 3D space where avatars often meet random people. Nina Patel, co-founder of Kabuni, told DailyMail.com about how she was 'virtually gang raped' by four male avatars in Meta's Horizon Worlds Patel was targeted simply for having a female avatar, an experience she described as 'surreal' and 'horrible.'  ‘They relentlessly harassed me and then proceeded to (what can only be described) as the sexual assault of my avatar,' she explained. 'Their behavior was offensive and disturbing.’ Horizon Worlds is a pioneering metaverse space owned by Mark Zuckerberg's Meta - a free 3D world where avatars can explore and talk to each other, accessible via Meta Quests headsets and other hardware. But like many VR spaces, it’s not heavily policed, and sexism, homophobia and racism are rife, researchers have said. ‘The attack likely occurred in that instance because of the anonymity and perceived lack of consequences within the VR space,' Patel said. Patel is co-founder of Kabuni, and is an expert in metaverse and VR - hence she was one of the earlier users of Horizon Worlds.  The attack saw the male avatars mobbing her character, yelling abuse at her and taking photos in-game - with one jeering attacker making a very crude suggestion over what she should do with the images.  ‘Some people may engage in such offensive behaviors in VR settings because they feel detached from their real-world identities and believe they can act without facing any repercussions. ‘Another issue potentially is that on some VR platforms, aggressive and violent behavior is encouraged and rewarded.’ She said that the feelings such attacks can evoke are very real. Pointing to a recent case in Britain where a young girl was assaulted in VR and contacted the police, Patel said: ‘The emotional and psychological impact of VR can be very genuine and impactful. Horizon Worlds is a pioneering metaverse space owned by Mark Zuckerberg's Meta - a free 3D world where avatars can explore and talk to each other, accessible via Meta Quests headsets and other hardware The girl under the age of 16 is said to have been left distraught after her avatar was gang raped by online strangers.  Officers said she suffered the same psychological and emotional t...",-3
Flug­eldar forsetaframbjóðanda vöktu barn,2024-01-13T14:40:29+00:00,https://www.visir.is/g/20242514469d/flugeldar-forsetaframbjodanda-voktu-barn,"Sigríður Hrund Pétursdóttir tilkynnti framboð sitt til forseta í gær með pompi, prakt og flugeldum, eflaust til mikillar gleði viðstaddra. Minni gleði vakti það þó hjá íbúum nágrennisins en þeir kunnu ekki að meta uppátæki Sigríðar. Veislan var haldin á Kjarvalsstöðum og margir sem búa í nágrenninu. Flugeldum var skotið upp við tilefni um áttaleytið og vakti veikt barn Sævars Snorrasonar, íbúa í Norðurmýri. Sigríður tilkynnti framboð sitt í beinni útsendingu í kvöldfréttum Stöðvar 2 í gær.  Hann spyr sig hvað fólki finnst um að forsetaframbjóðandi virði lög landsins að vettugi og veki ungabörn og hræði gæludýr. Lögin kveða á það að ekki megi skjóta flugeldum eftir þrettándann nema sérstakt leyfi lögreglunnar sé fyrir hendi. „Ég var nýbúinn að svæfa og kominn með hundinn upp í sófa. Ég er með veikt barn heima og svo allt í einu fer allt í gang. Ég hafði ekki hugmynd um hvað var í gangi,“ segir Sævar í samtali við fréttastofu. „Ég hringdi í Neyðarlínuna og tilkynnti þetta bara til lögreglunnar. Ég hélt að það væru einhverjir vitleysingar að sprengja,“ bætir hann við. Sævar segir framkoma Sigríðar koma sér sérstaklega á óvart fyrir forsetaframbjóðanda og sérstaklega þar sem hann teldi Guðna hafa verið yfir allt slíkt athæfi hafinn. „Svo fer maður að hugsa um embættið sem verið er að bjóða sig fram í. Að það sé verið að virða svona reglur að vettugi til að halda gott partí. Eina sem ég get sagt um þetta er að ég muni allavega ekki kjósa hana og hún hefur misst nokkur atkvæði í Norðurmýrinni,“ segir Sævar. Samkvæmt Hödd Vilhjálmsdóttur, fjölmiðla- og samskiptastjóra framboðs Sigríðar, var uppákoman hugmynd eiginmanns Sigríðar og að hann vildi koma henni á óvart. Sigríður hafi ekki vitað af því fyrirfram. Ekkert leyfi hafi verið fyrir hendi og hefði átt að tryggja það áður en ákveðið var að blása til flugeldasýningar. Hávaðinn hafi ekki varað nema í einhverjar þrjár mínútur og það fyrir klukkan átta en að Sigríði þyki leitt að það hafi ónáðað nágrannana. Sigríður Hrund Pétursdóttir, fjárfestir og fyrrverandi forseti Félags kvenna í atvinnulífinu, hyggst bjóða sig fram til forseta Íslands. ",0

Meta whistleblower: Regulators are our ‘last hope’ at fixing social media,2024-01-24T23:05:06+00:00,https://www.politico.eu/article/meta-whistleblower-regulators-are-our-last-hope-at-fixing-social-media/,"
				Arturo Béjar, who previously worked on safety at Meta, is in London meeting ministers, regulators and lawmakers.			 LONDON — A former insider at tech giant Meta has said that social media companies are failing to keep kids safe online, and that government regulators must step in. “Regulators are our last hope at peace. They really are our last hope,” Arturo Béjar told POLITICO at a cafe in central London on Tuesday, shortly before a meeting with the country’s media regulator Ofcom, which will be tasked with enforcing Britain’s sprawling new internet rulebook, the Online Safety Act. Béjar, who worked on safety at Meta during two stints over the last decade, claims his efforts to flag problems to senior leadership at the company went unheeded. He decided to go public with his concerns last year, testifying in evidence to the United States Congress in November that children, including his own daughter and her friends, were receiving unwanted sexual advances on Instagram. According to the whistleblower, many of the measures he had implemented during his first stint at Meta, such as tools designed to make it easier to report problems, had gone when he returned to the company as a consultant in 2019. “When you hear from the inside from Arturo [Béjar] that it isn’t getting better, it’s getting worse, what other mechanism do we have to say to these companies that this is not good enough? The only mechanism I can see is regulation,” said Ian Russell of the Molly Rose Foundation, which is shepherding Béjar around meetings with U.K. policymakers, including the Science and Tech Secretary Michelle Donelan, Security Minister Tom Tugendhat and Labour’s Shadow Technology Minister Peter Kyle. “It’s patently obvious that self-regulation has failed. Molly would still be alive today if the platforms had been better regulated,” said Russell, referring to his daughter Molly Russell, who took her own life after being exposed to a stream of self-harm content on platforms like Instagram and Pinterest. Meta said it had introduced “more than 30 tools and resources to support teens and their families.” Béjar, who lives in California, said he was in the U.K. because it is “the furthest ahead in the world when it comes to trying to put in a framework that protects kids.” Britain’s “Children’s code,” a framework designed to protect kids online, is widely considered world leading and has inspired lawmakers as far away as California. Last year Britain followed jurisdictions including the EU by bringing in tough new online content rules, known as the Online Safety Act. In a nod to Meta’s roll out of end-to-end encryption on Facebook and Instagram, Béjar said that anyone who thought the technology should be introduced to kids’ private messages should be ruled out of a job at Ofcom, which has launched a major recruitment drive ahead of the act coming into force. “When a child disappears, that’s how you find them,” he said, referring to the ability for law enforcement to get in...",-2

How deep are our divisions?,2024-01-24T19:41:19+00:00,https://catholicreview.org/how-deep-are-our-divisions/,"Catholic Review Inspiring the Archdiocese of Baltimore  January 24, 2024By Greg Erlandson OSV News

Filed Under: Commentary

 The movie, musical and now musical movie “Mean Girls” is a reminder of one of the more miserable sides of adolescence: In groups and out groups, the cool kids and the losers, the nerds and the jocks. Unfortunately, however, in groups and out groups don’t just exist in grammar schools and high schools. Social scientists say this kind of group identity is hard-wired in us. We seek the protection of our tribe and we view outsiders with hostility. This is one way to understand our highly polarized and politicized world today. Americans increasingly identify with one political group and react with hostility or fear to those who are not in their group. Political identity has become a “meta-identity,” impacting not just our politics but where we live, how we pray, who we associate with. Communities are becoming more politically homogenous as we seek out like-minded people and avoid those who do not think like us. That is one of the intriguing insights of Father Robert Aaron Wessman, the author of “The Church’s Mission in a Polarized World” (New City Press). In an effort to understand the harsh divides that are separating Americans, including Catholics, Father Wessman explores the power of groups, looking at the sociological and psychological research that shows how important group identity is, and how easily it can pit us against each other. Surveys show that when our political identity is more and more central to how we see ourselves as members of a group, the less likely we are to want to associate with or socialize with people who are not in our group. This is most obvious this year in our presidential politics, where a Trump voter in a red state is unlikely to socialize with Biden supporters, and a Biden supporter in a blue state is unlikely to socialize with Trump voters. Surveys suggest that as we grow more polarized, we even view these political differences the way we once viewed religious differences. Today, parents are more likely to be concerned about their child marrying someone from another party than someone from another faith tradition. In “mean girl” terms, we identify our group as the “in group,” and the other side as the “out group.” Most disturbing is that often the punishment or defeat of the out group becomes our primary driver. Rather than looking for areas of agreement or compromise, we look for annihilation. “Rage motivates,” Father Wessman wrote, and politicians are incentivized to stimulate this rage. “There exists an ‘us versus them’ competition taking place where winner takes all, and where the common good is rarely considered,” Father Wessman wrote. For Christians, this environment is spiritually deadly. It divides us not just into warring camps, but hate-filled ones. Nor is the church immune to this polarization. On a political level, red Catholics and blue Catholics are tempted to pick and choose whi...",0
AI and crypto mining are driving up data centers’ energy use,2024-01-24T17:56:38+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24049047/data-center-ai-crypto-bitcoin-mining-electricity-report-iea,"By  Justine Calma, a senior science reporter covering climate change, clean energy, and environmental justice with more than a decade of experience. She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home, a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals. Data centers could gobble up twice as much electricity by 2026 thanks in large part to cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence, according to a new report from the International Energy Agency (IEA). We rely on data centers to store all our emails, photos, cat videos, and everything else floating around in the cloud. More and more, data centers are cropping up to mine Bitcoin and train AI.  That’s already triggered backlash over the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies and AI tools like ChatGPT, since all those data centers are responsible for greenhouse gas emissions tied to their electricity use. The world will need a lot more renewable energy to clean up pollution from power grids and satiate skyrocketing electricity demand from data centers at the same time. That growth is equivalent to adding an extra country’s worth of electricity demand Data centers, cryptocurrencies, and AI made up around 2 percent of global electricity demand in 2022, using 460TWh of electricity, according to the IEA’s annual electricity report released today. Crypto mining alone is estimated to account for nearly a quarter of that electricity consumption, burning through 110TWh in 2022. By 2026, electricity consumption from data centers — including those used for cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence — could rise up to 1,050TWh depending on the pace the technology develops. That growth is equivalent to adding an extra country’s worth of electricity demand; Sweden under a more modest scenario or Germany at the most. The US has the most data centers today, with 33 percent of the world’s approximately 8,000 data centers. It’s also the country with the most Bitcoin mining. The IEA forecasts a “rapid pace” of growth for data center electricity consumption in the US over the next couple of years, rising from roughly 4 percent of US demand in 2022 to 6 percent by 2026. Expanding 5G networks and cloud-based services are other drivers of that growth. Ireland, with one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the European Union, is expected to see a boom in new data centers. Its 82 data centers already accounted for 17 percent of the country’s electricity consumption in 2022. Another 54 are either under construction or recently approved to start building. By 2026, all those data centers could be responsible for nearly a third of the country’s annual electricity demand. “The rapid expansion of the data centre sector and the elevated electricity demand can pose challenges for the electricity system,” the IEA report says. The risk isn’t unique to Ireland. In London, data center electricity demands have made it harder to develop more housing. Texas, a hub for Bitcoin mining in the US, has to grapple with new cryp...",-2

"Court rules in favor of a web scraper, Bright Data, which Meta had used and then sued",2024-01-24T15:57:21+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/court-rules-in-favor-of-a-web-scraper-bright-data-which-meta-had-used-and-then-sued/,"Meta has lost a claim in its legal battle with an Israeli tech firm Bright Data, which it sued last year for scraping data from Facebook and Instagram via the web. The tech giant, which has a long history of suing data scraping businesses, claimed that Bright Data’s data harvesting was a violation of its terms of service — which Bright Data had agreed to by having accounts on Meta’s platforms. However, a court has ruled in favor of Bright Data on Meta’s “breach of contract” claim, saying that Meta had not presented sufficient evidence that the firm had scraped anything but public data. The lawsuit was particularly interesting because it revealed that Meta had earlier paid Bright Data to gather data from e-commerce websites to build brand profiles on its platforms. In other words, Meta was a customer of Bright Data’s web-scraping services before it went to sue them, though it used the company’s services for a different purpose. In a related matter, Bright Data had also been accused of collecting personal information about minors pulled from Facebook and Instagram, Bloomberg reported last year. The court said it denied Meta’s motion for a partial summary judgment on the breach of contract claim because the company had not presented enough evidence that Bright Data scraped non-public data — meaning data that’s not behind a log-in screen or that’s password-protected. Instead, what Meta brought to the court was an example of a dataset Bright Data offered for sale, which included 615 million records of Instagram user data. The dataset sells for $860,000. Meta claimed Bright Data had been collecting and selling “vast” amounts of user data like this dataset, which had included fields like Instagram users’ names, ID, country, post count, bio, hashtags, followers, posts, profile images, business category, email, and more. However, Meta failed to establish that such data could be collected only if Bright Data had been logged into a user account. In another example of Bright Data’s activity, Meta attempted to show that the firm was in possession of non-public information, but the court decided this didn’t prove logged-in scraping as the data could have been publicly accessible at an earlier time — like before a user changed their privacy settings, for example. In addition, Meta argued that Bright Data had used tools to circumvent its access restrictions like CAPTCHAs, which proved Bright Data collected data “behind authentication barriers.” The court disagreed with this, too, saying that using an automated program to bypass a CAPTCHA “is different from accessing a password-protected website” and that “Meta surely understands the difference.” Even though Meta’s anti-scraping investigation team found that Bright Data had advertised a “scraping browser” that would automate logging into a website and simulating other user action to facilitate automated data collection, the court said this, too, wasn’t sufficient evidence that Bright Data had conducted logged-in ...",-2

LA Times slashes its newsroom by ONE FIFTH as it lays off 115 workers to try to fill $40 MILLION black hole: Biggest bloodshed in the paper's history after publisher slammed Google and Meta for an 'unfair usurpation' of democracy,2024-01-23T20:46:46+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12997559/LA-Times-owner-layoffs.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By Germania Rodriguez Poleo For Dailymail.Com    Published:  20:42, 23 January 2024   |  Updated:  21:46, 23 January 2024      23 View  comments  The Los Angeles Times has slashed over a fifth of its workforce - one of the worst days in the paper's 142-year history - as it faces $40million in revenue losses. The paper's owner, biotech billionaire Dr Patrick Soon-Shiong, said the loss of 115 workers was necessary as the business is losing $30million to $40million per year. 'Today's decision is painful for all, but it is imperative that we act urgently and take steps to build a sustainable and thriving paper for the next generation. We are committed to doing so,' Soon-Shiong said. Soon-Shion, who acquired the paper in 2018 for $500million, had promised to revive it but has expressed concern over the control Facebook and Google have over the news industry's revenue. 'They freely use all the amazing journalism work being produced locally, regionally and nationally while drawing away the revenue stream,' Soon-Shion, 71, told the Wall Street Journal in 2019. 'At some point, something will have to be done to address that, because it has become an unfair breach of the infrastructure of democracy.'  The paper's owner, biotech billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, said the loss of 115 workers was necessary as the business is losing $30 to to $40million a year About 400 union members walked off the job last week for the first time in the paper's history in protest of the looming layoffs News publishers have seen major losses after Meta's Facebook moved away from news content, ending partnerships with outlets and banning Canadian users from sharing news over a law that requires tech firms to pay fees to news organizations. Soon-Shion also called on lawmakers to take action to save news organizations being starved of revenue in the internet era. He added: 'I'd like to put the question to them: What can they do to help preserve a free and robust press, one that is instrumental in upholding our democracy? 'All we are asking for is the opportunity for our newspaper and hardworking journalists to be fairly compensated, and for the LA Times to have a fair chance to become a self-sustaining institution.' On Tuesday, the billionaire said he was disappointed that the newsroom guild had focused on a one-day strike last Friday instead of working with management to come up with a plan, adding the protest 'did not help' the situation. About 400 union members walked off the job last week for the first time in the paper's history in protest of the looming layoffs. Soon-Shiong, worth an estimated $5.4billion, had great hopes for the historic publication when he bought it and claims he has invested over $1billion since the purchase.  The LA Times, the largest newsroom in the western US, has been going through turmoil for the last years The LA Times, the largest newsroom in the western US, has been going through turmoil for the last years, according to insiders.

Meta’s Oversight Board raises concerns over automated moderation of hate speech,2024-01-23T15:43:59+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/metas-oversight-board-raises-concerns-over-automated-moderation-of-hate-speech-154359848.html?src=rss,"Meta's Oversight Board has raised concerns over automated moderation while overturning a decision by the company to leave a Holocaust denial post on Instagram. Holocaust denial is deemed hate speech under Meta's policies. The post in question depicted Squidward from SpongeBob Squarepants and purported to include true facts about the Holocaust. However, the claims ""were either blatantly untrue or misrepresented historical facts,"" the Oversight Board said. Users reported the post six times after it first appeared in September 2020, but in four instances Meta's systems either determined that the content didn't violate the rules or they automatically closed the case. In early 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, Meta started automatically closing content reviews to lessen the workload for human reviewers and free up bandwidth for manual review of high-risk reports. All the same, two of the Squidward post reports were also deemed non-violating by human reviewers. Last May, one user lodged an appeal against Meta's decision to leave the offending content on Instagram. But this appeal was again closed automatically by Meta due to its COVID-19 automation policies, according to the Oversight Board. The user then appealed to the board, which took up the case. The board conducted an assessment of Holocaust denial content across Meta's platforms and it found that the Squidward meme was used to spread various types of antisemitic narratives. It notes that some users attempt to evade detection and continue to spread Holocaust denial content by using alternate spellings of words (such as replacing letters with symbols) and using cartoons and memes. The Oversight Board said it's concerned that Meta continued to employ its COVID-19 automation policies as of last May, ""long after circumstances reasonably justified them."" It also cited unease over ""the effectiveness and accuracy of Meta’s moderation systems in removing Holocaust denial content from its platforms."" It notes that human reviewers can't granularly label offending content as ""Holocaust denial"" (such posts are filtered into a ""hate speech"" bucket). The board also wants to know more about the company's ability to ""prioritize accurate enforcement of hate speech at a granular policy level"" as it leans more heavily on AI for content moderation. The board recommended that Meta ""take technical steps"" to make sure it systematically and sufficiently measures how accurate it is in enforcing Holocaust denial content. That includes gathering more granular information. The board also asked Meta to confirm publicly whether it has ceased all COVID-19 automation policies it established during the onset of the pandemic. When asked for comment, Meta directed Engadget to its formal response to the board's decision on its transparency site. The company agrees that it left the offending post on Instagram in error and, at the time the board took up the case, Meta said it had removed the content. Following the board's case...",-2

"Meta is failing to catch memes and innuendo promoting Holocaust denial, oversight panel concludes",2024-01-23T13:00:35+00:00,https://www.jta.org/2024/01/23/default/meta-is-failing-to-catch-memes-and-innuendo-promoting-holocaust-denial-oversight-panel-concludes,"I accept the JTA Privacy Policy. By submitting the above I agree to the privacy policy and terms of use of JTA.org (JTA) – An Instagram post using a SpongeBob SquarePants meme to promote Holocaust denial managed to evade Meta’s system for removing such content, raising questions about the company’s ability to combat certain indirect forms of hate speech, an independent oversight panel concluded in a case published Tuesday. The finding came in a review of Meta’s handling of a post featuring a meme of Squidward, a character from the cartoon series SpongeBob SquarePants, entitled “Fun Facts about the Holocaust.” A speech bubble next to the character contained lies and distortions about the Holocaust, including false claims that 6 million Jews could not have been murdered and that chimneys of the crematoria at Auschwitz were built only after World War II. Withstanding six complaints from users that generated four automated reviews and two human assessments, the post stayed up from September 2020 until last year when Meta’s Oversight Board decided it would examine the situation and the company subsequently announced the post violated its policy against hate speech. The post even survived two user complaints that came after Meta’s adoption in October 2020 of a new rule expanding on its hate speech policy to explicitly bar Holocaust denial. As part of its review in the SpongeBob case, the Oversight Board commissioned a team of researchers to search for Holocaust denial on Meta’s platforms. It was not hard to find examples, including posts using the same Squidward meme to promote other types of antisemitic narratives. Users try to evade Meta’s detection and removal system, the researchers found. Vowels are replaced with symbols, for example, and cartoons and memes offer a way to implicitly deny the history of the Holocaust without directly saying it didn’t happen. Content moderation on social media is a notoriously difficult task. Some platforms, such as X, formerly known as Twitter, have taken a more hands-off approach, preferring to reduce oversight rather than err and risk stifling legitimate speech, which has resulted for X in the proliferation of antisemitism and extremism. Meta has gone in the direction of increased moderation, even agreeing to empower the Oversight Board to make binding decisions in disputes over violations of the platform’s content policies. Meta’s vigilance has led in some cases to the accidental removal of content intended to criticize hate speech or educate the public about the Holocaust. The Oversight Board has repeatedly urged Meta to refine its algorithms and processes to reduce the chance of mistakes and improve transparency when it comes to enforcing the ban on Holocaust denial. Meta set up its oversight panel amid mounting controversy over how the company handles content moderation. The move opened Meta to new scrutiny but did not stop the criticism. When, for example, the panel announced the SpongeBob case and requested...",-2

Mark Zuckerberg reveals NVIDIA and $10.5 billion will power new human-level AI,2024-01-23T07:11:03+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/95751/mark-zuckerberg-reveals-nvidia-and-10-5-billion-will-power-new-human-level-ai/index.html,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has revealed the company's plans to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), an artificial intelligence-powered system comparable to human-level intelligence. In a new post published to Zuckerberg's Instagram account, the Facebook founder outlined the company's ambition to become a leader in the race to develop the world's first AGI. According to Zuckerberg, Meta will be betting big on its plan to develop an open-source AGI, with the company's CEO saying it will be purchasing an astonishing 350,000 NVIDIA H100 AI GPUs, which are each priced at approximately $30,000 ($10.5 billion total). Additionally, Zuckerberg said that overall, nearly 600,000 H100-equivalent of compute power would eventually be established if you count all of the other GPUs the company will have under the hood. The announcement from Zuckerberg has many researchers worried about the repercussions of releasing an open-source AGI before ways of regulating it have been developed. Speaking to The Guardian, Dame Wendy Hall, a computer scientist at the University of Southampton in England, said that if the technology were to get into the wrong hands, the result could be a great deal of harm. Hall added that it's ""so irresponsible for the company to suggest it"". Furthermore, Hall said that despite Zuckerberg's announcement, the achievement of reaching a human-level AI is still ""many years away,"" which will give regulators some time to draw up policies that protect society from any potential harm caused by the new technology. ""It is a matter of public safety that we progress this work with some urgency,"" said Hall ""It is a matter of public safety that we progress this work with some urgency,"" said Hall ""There are deep and complex arguments about the merits of open-sourcing current AI models, pushing that into the realm of AGI could be world-saving or catastrophic. These decisions need to be taken by international consensus, not in the boardroom of a tech giant,"" said Andrew Rogoyski, one of the directors of the Institute for People-Centred AI at the University of Surrey ""There are deep and complex arguments about the merits of open-sourcing current AI models, pushing that into the realm of AGI could be world-saving or catastrophic.

 Update: On January 24, Meta responded to Human Rights Watch's letter dated January 8.  (Beirut) – Meta should do more to protect the safety of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and all its users, in particular on Facebook and Instagram, Human Rights Watch, Social Media Exchange (SMEX), INSM Foundation for Digital Rights, Helem, and Damj Association said in the #SecureOurSocials campaign opened today. The campaign, building on the work of various human rights organizations, is based on a February 2023 Human Rights Watch report, “‘All This Terror Because of a Photo’: Digital Targeting and Its Offline Consequences for LGBT People in the Middle East and North Africa.” Human Rights Watch examined the use of digital targeting by security forces and its far-reaching offline consequences—including arbitrary detention and torture—in five countries: Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Tunisia. The findings showed that security forces use social media platforms, including Facebook and Instagram, to entrap and harass LGBT people, as well as to gather and create evidence to prosecute them. We are calling on Facebook and Instagram to do more to make their social media platforms safe for LGBT users who face digital targeting and severe offline consequences including detention and torture. “As the largest social media company in the world, Meta should be a global leader in making social media safe for everyone,” said Rasha Younes, acting LGBT rights deputy director at Human Rights Watch. “When LGBT people, who already face insecurity offline, use Facebook and Instagram for connection and organizing, they deserve certainty that Meta is doing everything in its power to ensure their security.” Based on Human Rights Watch research and civil society recommendations, the #SecureOurSocials campaign aims to engage Facebook and Instagram to be more transparent and accountable by publishing meaningful data on investment in user safety, including regarding content moderation in the MENA region and around the world. LGBT people Human Rights Watch interviewed reported losing their jobs; being subjected to family violence, including conversion practices; having to change their place of residence and even flee their country; and experiencing severe mental health consequences as a result of being targeted online, including on Facebook and Instagram. Human Rights Watch interviewed dozens of LGBT people who indicated that they had reported being harassed, doxxed, outed, and abused on Facebook and Instagram, but in all these cases, Meta either did not respond to their complaints or found that...",-2

Meta to let EU users unlink Instagram and Facebook,2024-01-22T15:51:09+00:00,https://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/meta-facebook-instagram-unlink-eu-digital-markets-act-dma,"
by Vish Gain
 
22 Jan 2024  Image: Meta As the March deadline for the DMA to take effect approaches, Meta is making sure it follows all EU rules that promote ‘fairness’ and ‘contestability’. Meta will allow EU users to unlink their Instagram and Facebook accounts ahead of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) coming into force in March. In an announcement today (22 January), the Facebook and Instagram parent company said that it will give its users in the EU, EEA (European Economic Area) and Switzerland more choices on how they would like to manage their Meta accounts in order to comply with the DMA. “Over the next few weeks, people will receive notifications that will inform them about their ability to choose whether they would like to share information between our services,” the company wrote. Users who have already chosen to connect their Instagram and Facebook will be able to either continue to keep their accounts connected or manage them separately so that their information is “no longer used” across accounts. They can also choose to separate Messenger from Facebook to create a standalone messaging account without losing access to features such as voice and video calls. Additionally, users can choose to disallow Meta from using their Facebook info for Marketplace or Gaming. “People in the EU, EEA and Switzerland also have the ability to use Instagram and Facebook for free with ads, or subscribe to stop seeing ads,” Meta added. “If people subscribe to stop seeing ads, their information will not be used for ads. This choice rolled out in November 2023.” Meta also said that it supports the ambition of the DMA to promote contestability and fairness in digital markets. “We are committed to continue working hard to ensure that Meta’s products in the EU comply with the DMA and deliver value to people – we have assembled a large cross-functional team staffed by senior employees from around the globe and across our entire family of apps to achieve that.” Last week, Instagram introduced what it calls Nighttime Nudges for teenage users to encourage them to close the app at night following criticism that it did not do enough to prevent some of the alleged damage the platform causes to younger users, such as exposure to interactions with strangers raising safety concerns as well as the time-consuming nature of the app. This came a week after Meta introduced a set of new policies aimed at safeguarding teen users on Instagram and Facebook following a massive lawsuit against Meta, TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube in relation to child safety on their platforms. However, Meta whistleblower Arturo Béjar said there was still no way for a teen to flag an unwanted advance on Instagram or Facebook. 10 things you need to know direct to your inbox every weekday.

Meta to let EU users deny cross-site tracking as Digital Markets Act bites,2024-01-22T13:08:08+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/22/meta-dma-choices/,"Meta has provided new details of how it plans to respond to incoming competition rules in the European Union that aim to tackle abusive behaviors by Big Tech by enforcing fairer dealing on a handful of the world’s most powerful platforms. The Digital Markets Act (DMA) applies to just six (mostly U.S.) tech giants, including Meta. Back in September, the EU designated Meta as a “gatekeeper” — listing six of its products as “core platforms services” under the DMA — namely, its social networks, Facebook and Instagram; its ads delivery system; its messaging services, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger; and its virtual marketplace platform, Marketplace. Although the rules can apply more widely to other services offered by gatekeepers, not just to named services. The DMA generally puts limits on how gatekeepers can operate, including — of high relevance here — restricting their ability to process user data for advertising (with the regulation stipulating they must gain consent for this). The law also says gatekeepers must not combine user data between their core platform services or with user data from any other services gatekeepers provide or with personal data supplied by third parties — unless they provide users with a “specific choice” and obtain their consent. The deadline for gatekeepers to be compliant wit the DMA is March 7 — hence why the social networking giant is busy working up tweaks to its services in the region. In a blog post today, Meta writes that it will “soon” (over the “next few weeks”) start sending notifications to users in the region where the law applies (namely, countries in the EU, European Economic Area and/or Switzerland), offering them more choice over how they can use its services — including the ability to block Meta from combining data on their use of Facebook and their use of Instagram. That’s a biggie as it could effectively reverse a factor that motivated Facebook to spend a billion dollars buying Instagram in the first place, all the way back in 2012: Boosting its visibility of social media users’ activity, and deepening its ability to profile people’s interests to target them with ads, by buying a key rival and getting access to Instagram users’ data. Users of Meta’s dominant social networks will be able to tap this account separation choice via the existing Account Center feature. “We are offering these choices to address the requirements of the DMA, which enter into force in March 2024,” Meta writes, suggesting the choices won’t be live until the deadline for DMA compliance starts to bite in early March. The incoming choices will also enable regional users of Facebook Messenger to stop Meta combining their data with their use of its social network. Although Messenger users wishing to firewall their use of Meta’s products will have to create a new, separate Messenger account — which could generate some friction to discourage people to take the step of firewalling their messaging activity from public social networking....",-2
Meta is letting users uncouple Messenger and Marketplace accounts in the EU,2024-01-22T11:55:56+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-letting-users-uncouple-messenger-and-marketplace-accounts-in-the-eu-115556543.html?src=rss,"Meta has been fighting upcoming regulations in the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) for months, but no more. The company has announced it will comply with the DMA's stipulation that it can't favor its own services or force users to remain inside its ecosystem. This decision will greatly impact Meta's user experience in the EU, including allowing people to utilize Messenger and Facebook Marketplace without a Facebook account. Meta previously filed an appeal arguing that the two platforms should not be included under the DMA. Giving in means that Messenger and Facebook Marketplace users in the EU can now use the services and all of their functions through standalone accounts. The only difference for Marketplace is that conversations will occur over email. Along with Facebook Marketplace and Messenger, the European Commission's regulations on Meta include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Meta ads. For example, users can now keep their Facebook and Instagram accounts separate instead of linking information between the two platforms. The European Commission initially designated six companies as ""gatekeepers"" under the DMA: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft. There are 22 core platform services between them that fall under the law's jurisdiction due to factors like users, revenue and valuation. Qualification also hinged on ""if they provide an important gateway between businesses and consumers in relation to core platform services."" ByteDance and Apple are among the other companies which have pushed back against the DMA's regulations ahead of its March 2024 enforcement. However, Google (owned by Alphabet) recently announced that users could stop its platforms like YouTube and Chrome from sharing data. The creators of many hit indie games (including Vampire Survivors, Dead Cells and Spiritfarer) have come together to run their own showcase. You can watch The Triple-i Initiative here at 1PM ET. Blizzard games including World of Warcraft and Overwatch 2 are returning to China after the publisher reached a new licensing deal with NetEase.

"Meta's long-term vision for AGI: 600,000 x NVIDIA H100-equivalent AI GPUs for future of AI",2024-01-22T00:28:08+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/95693/meta-long-term-vision-for-agi-600-000-nvidia-h100-equivalent-ai-gpus-future-of/index.html,"Meta is on a war path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), where CEO Mark Zuckerberg teased in a new Instagram post that the social networking giant is betting big on AI and AI GPUs. The company is currently training its next-gen model Llama 3, where Meta is building massive compute infrastructure to support their future roadmap, including 350,000 x NVIDIA H100 AI GPUs by the end of the year. Zuckerberg added that overall, almost 600,000 x H100-equivalents of compute will be ready, as they're also buying AMD's new Instinct MI300X AI accelerators, not just NVIDIA AI GPUs. We should expect all this AI GPU power won't just be from NVIDIA's current-gen H100 AI GPU that's based on the Hopper GPU architecture, but NVIDIA's beefed-up H200 AI GPU and next-gen B100 AI GPU that's based on the next-gen Blackwell GPU architecture. Dylan Patel, Chief Analyst from SemiAnalysis, explained that NVIDIA will be increasing the output of its Hopper-based AI GPUs, which is a big family now. NVIDIA's current-gen Hopper AI GPUs include the H100, H200, GH100, GH200, and H20. Patel notes that NVIDIA is boosting production from 773,000 in Q1 2024, to 811,000 in Q2 2024... close to 100,000 more AI GPUs made in three months. Zuckerberg said: ""Some updates on our AI efforts. Our long term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit. We're bringing our two major AI research efforts (FAIR and GenAI) closer together to support this"". He continued: ""We're currently training our next-gen model Llama 3, and we're building massive compute infrastructure to support our future roadmap, including 350k H100s by the end of this year -- and overall almost 600k H100s equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs. Also really excited about our progress building new AI-centric computing devices like Ray Ban Meta smart glasses. Lots more to come soon"". Dylan Patel told Tom's Hardware: ""While NVIDIA has capacity to continue to grow in the 2nd half, the demand modeling we have done indicates a fall off in Hopper demand as hyperscalers shift to looking towards Blackwell"".

Sign in Home » Meta Ad Revenues Jump Nearly A Quarter, Amazon Also Sees Big Ad Revenue Climb Meta’s advertising revenues jumped by 24 per cent year-on-year to $US38 billion ($AU58.8 billion) in the three months ended 31 December. The number of ad impressions across all of Meta’s apps increased by more than a fifth and the average price per ad climbed by two per cent. Overall, the company’s revenue jumped by 25 per cent in the last quarter of 2023 compared to the same time in 2022. “We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow,” said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. “We’ve made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.” As a result of those bumper earnings, Meta’s stock price surged by 14 per cent in extended trading — despite Zuck’s bruising appearance in front of the US Senate Judiciary Committee which accused the American businessman of ignoring the severity of of child exploitation on his company’s apps. Its Reality Labs division, which is responsible for creating the metaverse, saw its losses grow a further nine per cent in the last quarter for just over $US4.6 billion ($AU7 billion). Meanwhile, Amazon saw its ad revenues climb by 27 per cent year — though it is operating in an entirely different universe to Meta’s soaring ad money. In Q4 2023, it brought in $US14.6 billion ($AU22.2 billion), up from $US11.5 billion ($AU17.49 billion). “This Q4 was a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon,” said Andy Jassy, Amazon CEO. “While we made meaningful revenue, operating income, and free cash flow progress, what we’re most pleased with is the continued invention and customer experience improvements across our businesses… AWS’s continued long-term focus on customers and feature delivery, coupled with new genAI capabilities like Bedrock, Q, and Trainium have resonated with customers and are starting to be reflected in our overall results; our Advertising services continue to improve and drive positive results; our newer businesses are progressing nicely, and along with our more established businesses, collectively making customers’ lives easier and better every day”.

AWS CEO Andy Jassy in a statement touted the unit’s “continued long-term focus on customers and feature delivery,” citing efforts to incorporate generative AI into many of its services. The new features “are starting to be reflected in our overall results,” he said. Amazon’s roster of high-spending business customers have provided it stable growth in an uncertain economy, but its position as the world’s biggest cloud provider is being challenged by Microsoft and Alphabet . To bolster its cloud business and in response to Microsoft’s promised $10 billion investment in ChatGPT parent OpenAI, Amazon is spending up to $4 billion in chatbot-maker Anthropic. Earlier this week, Microsoft and Alphabet reported generous cloud revenue gains in the December quarter, beating Wall Street estimates, as customers lined up to test new AI features and build their own AI services. But mounting costs of developing these cutting-edge features irked investors hoping for a big sales boost from the new technology, sending their shares down. “All eyes will be on AWS, where the mild acceleration of growth … leaves some lingering doubts about whether the cloud unit will be able to hold its own against rivals,” said Insider Intelligence senior analyst Sky Canaves. Amazon shares have climbed over six per cent this year and 41 per cent in the past 12 months. The stock, which surged 81 per cent in 2023, helped boost the S&P 500 .SPX by nearly a quarter last year along with other tech giants. Despite the strong performance, Amazon began the year by shedding jobs in several divisions. Last year, it cut more than 27,000 jobs after hiring heavily during the pandemic like other tech rivals. “We’re coming off a period where we’ve done a lot of hiring,” Amazon’s Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a call. “There’s a general feeling in most teams that we’re trying to hold the line on headcount.” Amazon has built fulfillment centers closer to customers, making it cheaper and faster to deliver packages. During the key Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping events last year, customers worldwide bought more than 1 billion items on Amazon. The company has also launched Buy With Prime, a service that enables...",0

"Meta's Reality labs had its best quarter, but still lost $4 billion",2024-02-01T23:11:35+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/metas-reality-labs-had-its-best-quarter-but-still-lost-4-billion-231135719.html?src=rss,"Reality Labs, Meta’s division for AR, VR and the metaverse, just had its best quarter yet despite continuing its multibillion-dollar losing streak. Reality Labs generated more than $1 billion in revenue during the final quarter of 2023 thanks to its Quest headsets and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. While crossing $1 billion in revenue is a new milestone for the company’s metaverse group, it’s still expected to continue racking up massive losses for the foreseeable future. Reality Labs lost $4.6 billion in the quarter, and more than $16 billion in 2023. Meta CFO Susan Li said that these losses are expected to “increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.” The fourth-quarter, which encompasses the holiday shopping season, has typically been when reality does the best. During a call with analysts, Mark Zuckerberg suggested that the company’s smart glasses had done particularly well, saying that Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica was “planning on making more [smart glasses] than we'd both expected due to high demand.” He added that both Quest 2 and Quest 3 were “performing well,” calling Quest 3 the “most popular mixed reality device.” Reality Labs aside, Meta had a strong quarter, reporting $40.1 billion to close out 2023, bringing its total revenue for the year to just under $135 billion. Facebook’s user base also grew to 2.1 billion daily active users (DAUs). Meta CFO Susan Li said that the company was “transitioning away” from sharing the metric and would no longer report on Facebook’s daily or monthly active users or its “family monthly active people.” The company had shared that it would eventually stop reporting user numbers back in 2019 as Facebook’s growth began to slow. But the change shows how Facebook’s position in the company’s “family of apps” has changed in recent years. A report from Pew Research earlier this week found that Instagram is continuing to grow in the US while Facebook use remains flat. Meta’s newest app, Threads, is still growing, however. Zuckerberg said the service has 130 million monthly users, up from “just under” 100 million last fall. “Threads now has more people actively using it today than it did during its initial launch peak,"" Zuckerberg said, referring to the app’s initial, but short-lived, surge in growth. Zuckerberg also talked more about his newly-stated ambition to create artificial general intelligence, or AGI at Meta, saying it would be the “theme” of the company’s product work going forward. “This next generation of services requires building full general intelligence,” he said. “It's clear that we're going to need our models to be able to reason, plan, code, remember and many other cognitive abilities in order to provide the best versions of the services that we envision.” The Meta CEO also indicated the company would be unlikely to offer any of its apps in alternative app stores ...",2
"Meta reveals dividend plans, Apple slumps in China, Amazon soars as tech earnings hit",2024-02-01T23:03:15+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/01/business/meta-reveals-dividend-plans-apple-slumps-in-china-amazon-soars-as-tech-earnings-hit/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Meta announced plans for its first-ever dividend and Amazon posted strong earnings, while Apple reported a sales slowdown in its key China market as three of the biggest tech stocks reported quarterly earnings on Thursday. The Big Tech behemoths, three of the so-called “Magnificent Seven,” have driven a market resurgence – though optimism has cooled in recent days as layoffs hammered the sector. Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta reported better-than-expected earnings, sending shares soaring more than 14% in after-hours trading – and boosting its market capitalization by a whopping $130 billion. The Facebook and Instagram parent said the dividend would be 50 cents per share of common stock, with payouts to be dispersed on March 26. The company also announced $50 billion in share buybacks. “We intend to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis going forward, subject to market conditions and approval by our board of directors,” the company said in a statement. The announcement was a positive development for Meta shareholders just one day after Zuckerberg was thrashed by Senate lawmakers on Capitol Hill over the company’s failure to protect kids from online sexual exploitation and abuse. Meta reported fourth-quarter earnings of $5.33 per share. Revenue jumped 25% to $40.1 billion. Both figures exceeded projections, according to LSEG data. “We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. “We’ve made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.”  The social media firm said it expects sales of up to $37 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2024, which was also higher than analysts expected. Apple’s results were a mixed bag. The company’s stock sank less than 2% in post-market trading as investors digested signs of a widening slump in China. Apple’s sales in the region plunged by 13% to $20.8 billion in the first quarter – lower than the $23.5 billion expected by analysts and the smallest figure since 2020, according to Bloomberg data. On the positive side, the company snapped a streak of four-straight sales declines, as revenue rose 2% to $119.58 billion in its all-important holiday sales quarter. Earnings jumped 16% to $2.18 per share. Sales of iPhones were also stronger than expected despite multiple warnings from analysts about potential weakness. “Today Apple is reporting revenue growth for the December quarter fueled by iPhone sales, and an all-time revenue record in Services,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. Cook also highlighted the upcoming release of Apple’s Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday as a sign the company was “committed as ever to the pursuit of groundbreaking innovation.” Elsewhere, Amazon shares popped by more than 9% as the ecommerce giant beat Wall Street’s expectations. The company’s quarterly sales jumped 14% to $170 billion. ...",3
Initiating Dividends Was Meta Platforms' Q4 2023 Outperformance Shocker,2024-02-01T22:50:57+00:00,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4666917-initiating-dividends-was-meta-platforms-q4-2023-outperformance-shocker?source=feed_all_articles,,No rating found
Mark Zuckerberg calls Apple’s DMA rules ‘so onerous’ he doubts any developer will opt in,2024-02-01T22:50:14+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/mark-zuckerberg-calls-apples-dma-rules-so-onerous-he-doubts-any-developer-will-opt-in/,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has added his voice to those criticizing Apple’s compliance with the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulation, which forces Apple to open up its App Store and allow developers to use their own payment systems, among other things. During Meta’s Q4 earnings call this afternoon, Zuckerberg responded to an investor question asking for Meta’s thoughts on the DMA by saying Apple’s new rules were “so onerous” that he would be surprised if any developer adopted them. The new regulations were meant to increase competition in the app economy by allowing other companies to run their own app stores and collect their own payments, which would, in theory, allow them to bypass Apple’s commissions and fees. But Apple’s compliance with the DMA reduced commissions but added other, new fees — including a new “Core Technology Fee” — that would apply to any developer who adopted the DMA rules, regardless of where their app was distributed, including on the App Store. Otherwise, Apple said developers could choose to remain on the same commission structure that exists today, where Apple takes a 15% to 30% cut of in-app purchase revenues, depending on the app’s reach and other factors. Had the DMA been written to be more airtight, Meta could have used the new law to launch its own app store. It had once toyed with the idea of offering a Facebook Games store, for example, but Apple’s rules forced Facebook to remove any actual gameplay functionality in the app. Meta eventually gave up, shutting down the app in 2022, two years after its launch. From Zuckerberg’s comments today, it doesn’t look like Meta has any intention of bringing it back. “I don’t think that the Apple thing is going to have any difference for us because I think that the way that they’ve implemented it, I would be very surprised if any developer chose to go into the alternative app stores that they have,” Zuckerberg told investors. “They’ve made it so onerous, and I think, so at odds with the intent of what the EU regulation was that I think it’s just going to be very difficult for anyone — including ourselves — to really seriously entertain what they’re doing there.” Meta joins other tech companies that have criticized Apple’s compliance with the DMA, including Epic Games, Spotify, Mozilla and Microsoft. Epic Games, which sued Apple over antitrust issues and largely lost, called Apple’s DMA rules “malicious compliance” and full of “junk fees.” Spotify dubbed them “extortion” and a “total farce,” and Microsoft said they were a “step in the wrong direction.” Another notable Apple critic, Match, said it hadn’t yet decided if it will opt into the new DMA rules, as it’s still examining them. Apple’s answer to EU’s gatekeeper rules is new ‘core tech’ fee for apps  Spotify calls Apple’s DMA compliance plan ‘extortion’ and a ‘complete and total farce’  Epic Games CEO calls out Apple’s DMA rules as ‘malicious compliance’ and full of ‘junk fees’ ",0
Facebook owner Meta to pay first dividend as three tech giants post bumper figures,2024-02-01T22:47:02+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-13035437/Facebook-owner-Meta-pay-dividend-three-tech-giants-post-bumper-figures.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By Leah Montebello    Updated:  22:47, 1 February 2024      8 View  comments  Facebook owner Meta said it will pay its first dividend as three of the world’s biggest tech firms posted bumper figures. In an announcement last night, the social media giant proposed a divi of $0.50 per share in a major boost for investors. It came as Meta posted revenues of £106billion for 2023, up 16 per cent from the year before. Profits climbed a quarter to £31billion. The company, which owns Instagram and Whatsapp as well as Facebook, said it now intends to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis. In an announcement last night, social media giant Meta proposed a divi of $0.50 per share in a major boost for investors The dividend announcement rounds off founder Mark Zuckerberg’s so-called ‘year of efficiency’, which saw the group lay off 21,000 employees and cut several innovative projects. The company now has around 67,000 employees around the world, a fifth less than it did the year before. Meta shares jumped 14 per cent in after-hours trading following the announcement. But it wasn’t just Facebook that enjoyed a boost. Amazon also posted stellar figures for the year, with sales hitting £451billion in 2023. This was up from the £403billion it made the previous year and came after sales in the Christmas quarter reached £133billion. Annual profits for the year hit £24billion. Andy Jassy, Amazon chief executive, said: ‘This fourth quarter was a record-breaking holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon’.  Amazon had also cut 28,000 jobs during 2023 as it retreated from its hiring spree during the pandemic. The tech sector cut 262,595 jobs in total through the course of 2023, according to data tracker Layoffs.fyi. Meanwhile Apple, which managed to dodge any major job cuts last year, posted a strong first quarter. This was largely bolstered by sales of its iPhone and strong growth at its services arm, which includes streaming service Apple TV. The tech giant posted revenues of £94billion for the three months to the end of December, while profits hit £27billion. The results come hot on the heels of fellow ‘Magnificent Seven’ members, Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft, which both posted their own quarterly results this week. Alphabet reported its fastest-growing quarter of revenue growth since early 2022, with sales of £67.7billion for the three months to the end of December – up 13 per cent from a year before, boosted by its cloud computing arm. But advertising remained a sore point, with fierce competition from platforms such as Facebook, Tiktok and Amazon, and a tough economic backdrop. Microsoft, which recently became the world’s most valuable company – topping $3trillion – posted record sales of £49billion in the three months to December on the back of booming demand for AI and cloud technology.

"Threads now reaches more 130 million monthly users, says Meta, up 30M from Q3",2024-02-01T21:53:46+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/threads-now-reaches-more-130-million-monthly-users-says-meta-up-30m-from-q3/,"Instagram Threads now has more than 130 million monthly active users, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings today. The text-based social networking app is one of the many new projects that have sprung up in the wake of Elon Musk’s 2022 acquisition of Twitter, now called X, where it competes with various startups and open source projects, including Bluesky, Mastodon, Nostr, Post, Spill and others. Zuckerberg said that Threads is “growing steadily,” though characterized the app as having blown up before Meta was ready. “I’ll note that Threads now has more people actively using it today than it did during its initial launch peak,” said Zuckerberg. “So that one’s I think on track to be a major success.” Last quarter, Zuckerberg also spoke highly of Threads, saying he believed the app had a good chance of reaching 1 billion users within a few years. At the time, Threads had north of 100 million monthly active users. Meta said its family of apps, which also includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, were used by 3.19 billion people daily in the fourth quarter, up from the 3.14 billion it saw in the quarter ending September 2023. Monthly active users were at 3.98 billion, up from 3.96 billion in the prior quarter. We’ve seen evidence that Threads has been gaining traction in recent weeks. App intelligence provider Appfigures found that the Instagram-owned app had tripled its downloads in December to become the No. 6 most downloaded app in the month across the Apple App Store and Google Play. X, still struggling with its rebranding, was No. 36. Image Credits: Appfigures Image Credits: Appfigures By leveraging Instagram’s friend graph, Threads had a record-breaking launch, reaching 100 million registered users within its first five days last July. But interest in Threads began to taper off in the fall, only returning to growth as Meta gave it a push by promoting Threads’ viral posts to Facebook users. That likely helped the app secure its spot in the top 10 most downloaded apps globally in December. Zuckerberg’s comments were likely meant to head off concerns that had been raised during Threads’ downturn, which had some critics prematurely declaring it dead. That doesn’t appear to be the case any more — and a third-party tracker says Threads has an estimated 160 million total users. As for Meta’s earnings, the company saw $40.1 billion in revenue in the quarter ending in December 2023, ahead of analysts’ estimates of $39.18 billion and earnings of $5.33 per share, ahead of estimates of $4.96. Net income was $14.02 billion. Revenue for the full-year 2023 was $134.90 billion. Meta also announced its first cash dividend of $0.50 per share, which will be paid in March to Meta’s shareholders.",2

"Chip race: Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Nvidia battle it out for AI chip supremacy",2024-02-01T20:20:35+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24058186/ai-chips-meta-microsoft-google-nvidia,"Filed under: By  Emilia David, a reporter who covers AI. Prior to joining The Verge, she covered the intersection between technology, finance, and the economy. The rise of generative AI has been powered by Nvidia and its advanced GPUs. As demand far outstrips supply, the H100 has become highly sought after and extremely expensive, making Nvidia a trillion-dollar company for the first time.  It’s also prompting customers, like Microsoft, Meta, OpenAI, Amazon, and Google to start working on their own AI processors. Meanwhile, Nvidia and other chip makers like AMD and Intel are now locked in an arms race to release newer, more efficient, and more powerful AI chips.  As demand for generative AI services continues to grow, it’s evident that chips will be the next big battleground for AI supremacy.  TODAY, 8 minutes ago Emilia David Meta promises the next generation of its custom AI chips will be more powerful and able to train its ranking models much faster.  The Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) is designed to work best with Meta’s ranking and recommendation models. The chips can help make training more efficient and inference — aka the actual reasoning task — easier.  Apr 9 Emma Roth Intel first introduced its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator last year, but now the company has revealed more details on performance. When compared to the H100 GPU, Intel says its Gaudi 3 accelerator can deliver “50% faster time-to-train on average across the Llama2 models” with better efficiency. The company also says the Gaudi 3 AI Accelerator will be a “fraction of the cost” of Nvidia’s pricey H100. It will become available to companies like Dell, HPE, and Lenovo in the second quarter of this year. Mar 29 Lauren Feiner Reuters reports the list could strengthen the Commerce Department’s existing restrictions on US tech shipments to Chinese chip factories. The US government has voiced national security concerns about letting China access US technology to grow its own capabilities. US companies have complained it’s difficult to know which Chinese factories produce advance chips and are subject to the restrictions, Reuters says. [Reuters] Mar 25 Emilia David CNN gained entry into the training facility where TSMC teaches engineers to design and operate the machines that build semiconductors. The hope is to train engineers to “seed” factories it’s building in the US, Japan, and Germany.  TSMC told CNN that it needs “to hire thousands more” employees to staff facilities around the world as demand for advanced chips grows.  Mar 19 Richard Lawler That’s what this NYT report says a16z and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund are considering, which may explain the rumors that Elon Musk (who denied them), Sam Altman, and others looking to the Middle East to fund their AI dreams. It also recalls last fall’s news that the US government added an “additional licensing requirement” for Nvidia and AMD AI shipments to unspecified Middle Eastern countries.

Should kids’ devices have filters for obscene material? | Opinion,2024-02-01T18:58:17+00:00,https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2024/2/1/24057455/protect-children-from-obscene-material-device-filter,"Technology is an important part of daily life. According to 2023 Pew Research, 95% of teens have smartphones and 65% have tablets. “Smart” devices can solve infinitely complex equations, measure sleep quality and remind people to take insulin. Yet almost none of them has been designed with children in mind. It’s a well-established fact that pornography harms children. A meta-analysis of 37 studies found that exposure to violent or rape pornography increased a child’s odds of experiencing sexual exploitation by nearly three times. Research shows that children are more susceptible than adults to addictions and developmental effects on the brain. What if a simple software update could prevent a child from being exposed to traumatizing, highly addictive and obscene material? What if a filter is already installed on a device but is turned off?  As adults, we want to make things as safe as possible for children. That’s why medicine bottles are so hard to open. We don’t purchase cars with seatbelts hidden in the trunk, hoping the owner figures out how to install them. We don’t allow minors to buy cigarettes because, like obscenity, we’ve recognized that tobacco is harmful. SB104 simply requires manufacturers to turn on existing filters that block obscene material when a minor activates a device. It defaults the filter to “on” instead of “off” for children. Utah has a moral obligation to protect children from this harm.  Some say it’s not feasible, but the technology is already there. Utah has always put families and children first and has never let precedence get in the way. By mandating safeguard capabilities from the get-go, we make protecting children the standard, not an afterthought.  Others might object to the bill because “protecting kids is a parent’s responsibility.” And I wholeheartedly agree. We’re not asking Apple and Google to do the job of Utah parents. We’re asking them to make it less difficult for parents to do so.  It’s not a silver bullet. It doesn’t prevent all digital harm. Instead, it’s surgical, technical and simple. It doesn’t impact retailers, cellular network providers, film, television or streaming services. SB104, the “Children’s Device Protection Act,” is responsible, careful, narrow legislation. If enacted, it can prevent early, accidental exposure to potentially life-altering and obscene content for children. Utah has never shied away from tackling challenging issues, especially when it comes to helping our youth. Together, we can do right by them.

Big Tech asked to support child safety legislation in child sexual exploitation hearing,2024-02-01T18:57:30+00:00,https://www.deseret.com/2024/2/1/24057336/zuckerberg-lee-graham-social-media,"Several CEOs of social media companies spoke at the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday afternoon during the hearing on “Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis.”  Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, Shou Chew, CEO of TikTok, Linda Vaccarino, CEO of X, and Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snapchat, all appeared before lawmakers during the at-times contentious hearing.   During the hearing, Utah Sen. Mike Lee cited a study that referenced child sexual abuse material that “reappeared more than 490,000 times after it had been reported.”  Addressing Citron, Lee explained, “Discord allows pornography on its site,” and he added that 17% of minors on Discord reported to “have had sexual interactions” on the platform. A majority of those minors said they believed those interactions were with an adult.  “We need laws to mandate this” and to create a systematic way of getting rid of it, “because there is literally no possible justification, no way of defending this,” Lee said.  Lee also referenced a new bill he is sponsoring that requires age verification for “all participants in pornographic images.” As acting chair of the committee, Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said five recent bipartisan bills failed to become law because of a lack of support from Big Tech companies. He added the Communications Decency Act of 1996 “immunized” tech companies from liability for content users create.  While the bills have bipartisan support in the House and in the Senate, each tech CEO said they did not support the bills.  Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., ranking member on the committee, addressed the Facebook founder. “Mr. Zuckerberg, I know you don’t mean it, but you’ve got blood on your hands,” he said, to cheers in the hearing room. In 2023, Snapchat made “690,000 reports to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children leading to more than 1,000 arrests,” Spiegel said. He added, “We also removed 2.2 million pieces of drug related content, and blocked 705,000 associated accounts.” In the same time frame, Vaccarino explained, “X suspended 12.4 million accounts for violating our CSE (Child Sexual Exploitation) policies.” She compared 2023’s action to the 2.3 million accounts removed in 2022.  Addressing Zuckerberg, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., referenced data collected on teenage girls between the ages of 13 and 15 from a whistleblower who had previously worked as a senior executive at Instagram.  “Thirty-seven percent said they had been exposed to nudity unwanted within the past seven days,” Hawley explained. He added, “Twenty-four percent said they had experienced unwanted sexual advances that had been propositioned within the last seven days. Seventeen percent said they had experienced self-harm content pushed at them in the last seven days.” Hawley asked Zuckerberg if he had apologized to the families of victims of sexual exploitation. He added, “Would you like to do so now?” Zuckerberg then stood, turned around and addressed some of the families of...",-2
Mark Zuckerberg se disculpa con familias por los daños causados en redes sociales,2024-02-01T18:41:36+00:00,https://kesq.com/kunamundo/noticias-cnn/cnn-spanish/2024/02/01/mark-zuckerberg-se-disculpa-con-familias-por-los-danos-causados-en-redes-sociales/," urielblanco (CNN) — Mark Zuckerberg, CEO de Meta, pidió perdón a familias presentes en el Congreso de Estados Unidos durante una polémica audiencia este miércoles ante la Comisión Judicial del Senado, en la cual varios directores ejecutivos de las grandes empresas de redes sociales testificaron sobre los riesgos que sus productos representan para los jóvenes. Zuckerberg se disculpó por los daños que las plataformas de redes sociales han causado a diversas familias. “Lamento todo lo que han pasado. Nadie debería pasar por las cosas que sus familias han sufrido y por eso invertimos tanto y vamos a seguir realizando esfuerzos en toda la industria para asegurarnos de que nadie tenga que pasar por las cosas que sus familias han tenido que sufrir”, dijo el CEO de Meta durante la audiencia. Directivos de Meta, TikTok y otras grandes tecnológicas comparecen en el Senado de EE.UU. para defender el impacto de las redes sociales en los adolescentes En su respuesta, el senador Josh Hawley pidió a Zuckerberg que, como multimillonario, “compense” a las familias cuyos hijos se han visto afectados por sus plataformas. Mark Zuckerberg, en el centro, se dirige al público durante la audiencia de este miércoles de la Comisión Judicial del Senado en la ciudad de Washington. (Crédito: Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg/Getty Images) Activistas en defensa de los jóvenes se mostraron reacios a las disculpas de Zuckerberg, al afirmar que hablar es fácil y le pidieron a la empresa que “se aparte del camino” de la regulación nacional. Arielle Geismar, de 22 años, empezó a utilizar Instagram hace una década y dice que se vio directamente afectada por los contenidos sobre trastornos alimenticios en la aplicación. Durante una entrevista al margen de la audiencia, acusó a Zuckerberg de restar importancia a la relación entre las redes sociales y los daños a la salud mental, y rechazó sus afirmaciones de que Meta y otras plataformas están trabajando duro para crear espacios seguros para los usuarios. “Es repugnante sentarse ahí y que te mientan”, dijo Geismar a CNN. “Es muy, muy agradable para él ser capaz de decir unas pocas palabras y apaciguar todo, pero no devuelve a ningún humano y no quita el daño”. “Quiero que las grandes tecnológicas se aparten del camino de nuestros representantes electos en su intento de regular este sector”, añadió Geismar. Zamaan Qureshi, copresidente del grupo de defensa Design It For Us, calificó la disculpa de Zuckerberg de “momento bastante loco” durante una entrevista con la CNN. “Creo que fue muy emotivo para mucha gente en la sala. Si estás aquí, puedes sentir esa tensión ahora mismo. Ciertamente se siente como si hubiera una marea cambiando para tratar de hacer algo aquí”. La denunciante de Facebook que comenzó años de escrutinio sobre el impacto de las redes sociales en los adolescentes dijo que la disculpa de Mark Zuckerberg a los padres era “alucinante”.

Are social media apps ‘dangerous products’? 2 scholars explain how the companies rely on young users but fail to protect them,2024-02-01T18:40:10+00:00,https://themoderatevoice.com/are-social-media-apps-dangerous-products-2-scholars-explain-how-the-companies-rely-on-young-users-but-fail-to-protect-them/,"The Moderate Voice An Internet hub with domestic and international news, analysis, original reporting, and popular features from the left, center, indies, centrists, moderates, and right February 1, 2024 by Guest Voice Leave a Comment  Joan Donovan, Boston University and Sara Parker, McGill University “You have blood on your hands.” “I’m sorry for everything you have all been through.” These quotes, the first from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., speaking to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and the second from Zuckerberg to families of victims of online child abuse in the audience, are highlights from an extraordinary day of testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about protecting children online.  But perhaps the most telling quote from the Jan. 31, 2024, hearing came not from the CEOs of Meta, TikTok, X, Discord or Snap but from Sen. Graham in his opening statement: Social media platforms “as they are currently designed and operate are dangerous products.” We are university researchers who study how social media organizes news, information and communities. Whether or not social media apps meet the legal definition of “unreasonably dangerous products,” the social media companies’ business models do rely on having millions of young users. At the same time, we believe that the companies have not invested sufficient resources to effectively protect those users. Mobile device use by children and teens skyrocketed during the pandemic and has stayed high. Naturally, teens want to be where their friends are, be it the skate park or on social media. In 2022, there were an estimated 49.8 million users age 17 and under of YouTube, 19 million of TikTok, 18 million of Snapchat, 16.7 million of Instagram, 9.9 million of Facebook and 7 million of Twitter, according to a recent study by researchers at Harvard’s Chan School of Public Health.  Teens are a significant revenue source for social media companies. Revenue from users 17 and under of social media was US$11 billion in 2022, according to the Chan School study. Instagram netted nearly $5 billion, while TikTok and YouTube each accrued over $2 billion. Teens mean green. Social media poses a range of risks for teens, from exposing them to harassment, bullying and sexual exploitation to encouraging eating disorders and suicidal ideation. For Congress to take meaningful action on protecting children online, we identify three issues that need to be accounted for: age, business model and content moderation. Social media companies have an incentive to look the other way in terms of their users’ ages. Otherwise they would have to spend the resources to moderate their content appropriately. Millions of underage users – those under 13 – are an “open secret” at Meta. Meta has described some potential strategies to verify user ages, like requiring identification or video selfies, and using AI to guess their age based on “Happy Birthday” messages.  However, the accuracy of these methods is not publicly open to scrutiny, s...",-3
Meta Quest adds support for Apple’s Spatial Video ahead of Vision Pro launch,2024-02-01T17:59:13+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/meta-quest-adds-support-for-apples-spatial-video-ahead-of-vision-pro-launch/,"Apple’s brand-new Vision Pro headset has lost one of its competitive advantages over rivals, as Meta announced today that it, too, will add support for spatial video playback on its more affordable Meta Quest. Spatial video, also known as stereoscopic videos, are videos Apple customers themselves can film with any iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max. Support for the feature rolled out with the release of iOS 17.2 in December, letting users film in three dimensions, so they could later relive their favorite memories through Apple’s mixed-reality headset. While Meta’s adoption of the feature is a win for Apple in making spatial video more of a standard for 3D recordings, it also makes Meta’s headset more competitive with Apple’s Vision Pro. Starting at $3,500, but costing closer to $4,600 with the necessary add-ons and accessories, as The New York Times reports, Apple’s headset is out of reach for many consumers. Meta’s Quest line-up, by comparison, has lower-cost options including the currently $250 Quest 2, $500 Quest 3 and $1,000 Quest Pro. Apple’s spatial video will be supported on Meta Quest devices via the v62 software update that’s beginning to roll out now, Meta says. Afterward, customers will be able to upload their spatial video recordings to their Meta headset using the Quest mobile app, allowing them to experience their memories in 3D. Meta says the uploaded content will be converted for playback on the Meta Quest hardware and stored in the cloud, and users will be able to select the videos from the “Files” menu when they want to watch them. In addition, users will be able to manage their videos from the Meta Quest mobile app gallery or the new spatial videos section of the Files menu on your headset. Meta also created some demo videos that customers can view to get a taste of the experience, even if they don’t own an iPhone 15 Pro device. Other improvements in the coming update include support for external gamepads, including PlayStation, Xbox and others. PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controllers and PlayStation 4 DualShock will also gain enhanced support, Meta says. The gamepad can connect both via Bluetooth or USB-C and can be used with games like Halo Infinite or Forza Horizon 5 with the Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) App. (The latter requires a supported headset and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership.) Facebook livestreaming is also now available to all Meta Quest users, after its original release in the v56 update, the company noted. Users will be able to “go live” from the Camera icon in the Universal Menu, so they can stream their VR activities to their friends. Those streaming to YouTube will now also see their chats while livestreaming with the new update.  Plus, Meta Quest users will now be able to perform common actions by looking down at their palm and then performing a simple gesture — like a short pinch to show and hide the Universal Menu or a long pinch to recenter the display. This change is likely Meta’s response to Vis...",2

Meta Quest headsets now support spatial video playback - ahead of Vision Pro launch,2024-02-01T17:23:00+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/meta-quest-headsets-now-support-spatial-video-playback-ahead-of-vision-pro-launch/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular We're less than 24 hours away from the long-awaited launch of Apple's Vision Pro headset, which means there's no better time for a new update to Meta Quest headsets. Coming in the latest v62 update, Meta is bringing spatial video playback to its Quest headsets, including the Quest 2, Quest 3, and Quest Pro models, along with several improvements to how you game and live stream. Also: I've tried Vision Pro and other top XR headsets and here's the one most people should buy Spatial videos, a format coined by Apple with its Vision Pro headset but are basically stereoscopic videos, can be recorded with an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max to produce content with added depth and separation between subjects. They're achieved by leveraging both the main and telephoto lenses of the new iPhones to measure and record the distance of subjects, resulting in a much more immersive visual experience. Arguably, the ability to watch spatial videos is the best feature on Apple's $3,500 headset, so it's no surprise that Meta, on the day before Vision Pro officially goes on sale, is announcing its headsets' compatibility with the video format. On v62, spatial videos can be uploaded to a Quest headset via the Meta Quest mobile app. Once uploaded, Meta says ""the content will be converted for playback on Meta Quest hardware and stored in the cloud."" Users can access their spatial videos in the Files menu of the headset, meaning they don't have to manage the content from the phone app every time. Even if you don't have any pre-recorded spatial videos, Meta is providing demo videos that you can watch in the meantime, also found in the Files menu. Along with spatial video playback, the latest software update brings support for external gamepads -- via Bluetooth or USB-C -- on the Meta Quest Browser. That includes PlayStation (DualSense and DualShock) and Xbox controllers. Content creators will also be delighted by the official rollout of in-app live streaming, available through Facebook and YouTube. Also: The best VR headsets: Expert tested and reviewed Finally, Meta is making it easier to navigate controller-free with new single-gesture quick actions. Looking down at your hand and tapping your thumb and index finger opens or closes the Universal Menu, which shows general information like time and battery status, as well as your frequently used apps. A long pinch recenters the menu bar, in case you ever wander off in the virtual world. For users who prefer the traditional Quick Action Menu, myself included, which includes tools like screen recording, taking photos, and muting the microphone, you can switch back by going to Settings > Movement tracking > and turn off Expanded Quick Actions. Also: How these $400 XR glasses cured my Apple Vision Pro FOMO Meta says it's rolling out the v62 update ""gradually,"" so you'll have to hang in there a little longer before reaping the benefits of all the new features mentioned above.",2

Senators find tech CEOs’ responses hollow after four-hour hearing ,2024-02-01T16:26:46+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24057460/senators-confront-meta-tiktok-snap-x-discord-ceos-kids-online-harm,"By  Lauren Feiner, the senior policy reporter at The Verge, covering the intersection of Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill. She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform. During an unusually emotional hearing on Wednesday, senators spent hours trying to get a group of five tech CEOs to confront the harms their platforms have caused and submit to more checks on their power. The Senate Judiciary Committee invited the CEOs of Meta, TikTok, Snap, X, and Discord to face the families of children who’d died following cyberbullying, sexual exploitation, or other harmful events on their platforms. They asked why Section 230, the law that shields online platforms from being held liable for their users’ posts, should stop these families from facing them in court. The CEOs expressed condolences for the families hurt on their services but reiterated the work and investment they’ve already made to keep users safe. Advocates and lawmakers were left unimpressed by the CEOs’ remarks — but emboldened to push forward their proposals. “We can do this,” Senate Judiciary Ranking Member Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said to Chair Dick Durbin (D-IL) at a press conference after the hearing. “Working with you, I pledge my complete and total support to go to the floor of the United States Senate and ask for a reckoning.” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), too, sounded optimistic after the hearing at a rally of supporters for the Kids Online Safety Act. The bill, which he leads with Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), would create a legal duty of care for large platforms to make their services safe for kids. “I can guarantee you, we will win this fight for the Kids Online Safety Act,” Blumenthal said, exuding the kind of confidence that’s a rarity in Washington, given the difficulty of passing legislation in a deeply divided Congress. A package of five kids online safety bills has already passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee with unanimous votes, including the EARN IT Act, which seeks to weaken Section 230 protections, and the Cooper Davis Act, that would require platforms to report known illicit drug trafficking on their sites to the Drug Enforcement Administration. KOSA, which was introduced in another committee, already has the support of nearly half the Senate. Lawmakers and parents seemed mostly unimpressed with the CEOs’ performance. Graham called it “pitiful” and “borderline bullshit.” Even a direct apology from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seemed to fall flat. At the prompting of Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), who asked if Zuckerberg had apologized to the families of social media victims, the CEO stood up and faced the back of the room, where several rows of parents sat with pictures of their kids. “I’m sorry for everything you have all been through,” Zuckerberg said. “No one should go through the things that your families have suffered and this is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry-leading ...",2

U.S. Corporations Are Openly Trying to Destroy Core Public Institutions. We Should All Be Worried.,2024-02-01T15:34:28+00:00,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/v7bnyb/meta-spacex-lawsuits-declaring-ftc-nlrb-unconstitutional,"Trader Joe’s has become the second company in a month to argue in court that the National Labor Relations Board is “unconstitutional,” following the lead of Elon Musk’s SpaceX, as both companies face board charges for firing employees. These two major corporations aren’t alone in attempting to protect their interests by undermining public institutions; Meta is also arguing in an ongoing lawsuit that the Federal Trade Commission is unconstitutional.  A legal expert told Motherboard that these companies are attempting to take advantage of what they believe is a friendly Supreme Court—judges currently lean right by a six-to-three margin—while they can. SpaceX, accused of illegally firing eight workers who were critical of Musk, filed its lawsuit one day after the Board brought charges against it, arguing that the agency lacked presidential oversight and violated the “separation of powers” provision outlined in the U.S. Constitution. Trader Joe’s, accused of union-busting, stated in a hearing that the Board was unconstitutional, and that it would “preserve the issue for further briefing and argument,” according to a transcript of the hearing shared by the Huffington Post. These companies are not the first to bring charges of unconstitutionality against core government agencies. In November, Meta sued the Federal Trade Commission for unconstitutionality in a bid to prevent the FTC from preventing the social media giant from profiting off of data collected from minors.  “Meta respectfully requests that this Court declare that certain fundamental aspects of the Commission’s structure violate the U.S. Constitution,” the company’s complaint stated. It argued that the FTC violated the constitution because it served as both prosecutor and judge, its commissioner could not be removed by the U.S. president, and it denied the company’s right to a trial by jury. “My sense is that the trend is increasing both because the corporations believe they have a sympathetic audience with this Supreme Court, and because workers' efforts to organize unions are increasing,” said Kate Andrias, a legal scholar at Columbia University who studies constitutional law and labor law. “So corporations feel more need to use all possible tools to resist.”  In April, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of a company challenging the FTC’s constitutional authority. Axon Enterprise, a company that makes TASERs and police body cameras, acquired competitor and police camera maker Vievu in 2018. The FTC challenged the acquisition two years later. Axon sued the agency for exercising unconstitutional authority, and after losing an appeals court decision in 2021, argued the case before the Supreme Court.  The Court ruled that the FTC Act, which established the agency and its administrative procedures in 1914, did not “displace a district court’s federal-question jurisdiction over claims challenging as unconstitutional the structure or existence” of the commission. The FTC abandoned its ...",-2
Google launches an AI-powered image generator,2024-02-01T15:00:15+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/google-launches-an-ai-powered-image-generator/,"Taylor Swift deepfakes be damned, Google is releasing a new AI-powered tool, ImageFX, for image creation. Underpinned by Imagen 2, a GenAI image model developed by Google’s DeepMind team, ImageFX offers a prompt-based UI to create and edit images. That’s no different than tools like OpenAI’s DALL-E 3, Midjourney, Meta’s Imagine with Meta AI and Microsoft Designer. But ImageFX’s unique twist is “expressive chips” — basically a list of keyword suggestions that let users experiment with “adjacent dimensions” of their creations and ideas. “Designed for experimentation and creativity, ImageFX lets you create images with a simple text prompt, then easily modify them with a new take on prompting using expressive chips,” Google writes in a blog post. But what of the potential for abuse — especially in light of recent events? Image Credits: Google Image Credits: Google Google claims that it’s taken steps to ensure that ImageFX can’t be used in ways that it wasn’t intended, for example by adding “technical safeguards” to limit “problematic outputs” like violent, offensive and sexually explicit content. ImageFX also has a prompt-level filter for “named people,” presumably public figures — although Google wasn’t especially clear on that point in its press materials. “We invested in the safety of training data from the outset,” Google said. “Consistent with our AI principles, we also conducted extensive adversarial testing and red teaming to identify and mitigate potential harmful and problematic content.” As an additional safety measure, Google’s tagging images produced using ImageFX with SynthID, a digital watermark that’s allegedly robust against image edits and crops. An image sample from Imagen 2. Image Credits: Google An image sample from Imagen 2. Image Credits: Google “SynthID watermarks are imperceptible to the human eye but detectable for identification,” Google continues in the blog post. “With added insights in ‘About this image,’ you’ll know if an image may have been generated with Google’s AI tools when you come across it in Google Search or Chrome.” You’ll find ImageFX in AI Test Kitchen, Google’s web app for experimental AI projects. In related news today, Google said that it’s bringing Imagen 2 to more of its products and services starting this week, including to its next-gen AI search experience and family of managed AI services Vertex AI. Imagen 2 — which also now powers text-to-image capabilities in Google Ads and Duet AI in Workspace, Google’s GenAI suite of products for productivity — has made its way into Google’s SGE (Search Generative Experience). SGE, which began surfacing image generation tools for users in Google Image Search last October, now taps Imagen 2 for generating images. Users can enter a prompt specifying what sort of image they want and SGE will return four results directly in the SGE conversational experience. Another sample from Imagen 2.

The Morning After: Senate tells social media CEOs they have ‘blood on their hands’,2024-02-01T13:31:01+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-senate-tells-social-media-ceos-they-have-blood-on-their-hands-133101841.html?src=rss,"The CEOs of Meta, Snap, Discord, X and TikTok testified at a high-stakes Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child exploitation online. During the hearing, Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel, Jason Citron, Linda Yaccarino and Shou Chew spent nearly four hours being grilled by lawmakers about their records on child safety. Judiciary Committee Chair, Senator Dick Durbin, noted Discord’s Citron “only accepted services of his subpoena” after US Marshals went to the company’s headquarters. Compared to previous hearings with tech CEOs, it was a heavier setting. The room was filled with parents of children who had been victims of online exploitation. “Discord has been used to groom, abduct and abuse children,” Durbin said. “Meta’s Instagram helped connect and promote a network of pedophiles. Snapchat’s disappearing messages have been co-opted by criminals who financially extort young victims. TikTok has become a, quote, platform of choice for predators to access, engage and groom children for abuse. And the prevalence of CSAM (child sexual abuse material) on X has grown as the company has gutted its trust and safety workforce.” Of course, it wouldn’t be a US Senate hearing without politicians also embarrassing themselves: Senator John Kennedy asked Snap’s Evan Spiegel if he knew the meaning of “yada yada yada” (Spiegel claimed he was “not familiar” with the phrase). “Can we agree… what you do is what you believe and everything else is just cottage cheese,” Kennedy asked. (… What?) X’s Yaccarino, who repeatedly claimed X was a “brand new company” (and not Twitter with a poorly received rebrand), said the platform was considering adding parental controls. “Being a 14-month-old company, we have reprioritized child protection and safety measures,” she said. “And we have just begun to talk about and discuss how we can enhance those with parental controls.” Twitter launched in 2006. — Mat Smith ​​You can get these reports delivered daily direct to your inbox.

The hearing was about online child safety which became a subject on this week’s edition of King Charles. Charles Barkley and Gayle King delved into the age-old social media debate on their CNN show. Since they’re old friends, King knew that Barkley is notoriously social media-free. She asked him why though. His answer was trademark Sir Charles. “Because I don’t want to bring fools into my life.” Unlike his social media-savvy bestie, Shaquille O’Neal, Charles Barkley swears off X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and every other social media platform Meta and otherwise.

"Apple, Amazon And Meta Take Spotlight As Stock Rally Wavers",2024-02-01T12:55:03+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/apple-amazon-and-meta-take-spotlight-as-stock-rally-wavers,"(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech’s struggle to meet lofty investor expectations this earnings season has taken air out of a record-breaking stock run. Pressure is now on Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. to come through on Thursday.   The sector has led the S&P 500 lower this week after results from Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. were met with selling by traders. Investors had bid up the stocks to records on bets that artificial intelligence efforts are set to provide a big lift to profits and sales.  “The market seems to want more and more from these companies,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist of LPL Financial LLC. “The market knows it has gone too far too fast and is saying ‘unless you astound us, we’re going to bring you down a number of notches.’” Big Tech stocks powered the S&P 500’s rally into record territory in January, but if this week is to set the tone for the month ahead, signs are pointing to uncertainty. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Stock Index suffered its biggest drop in three months on Wednesday after earnings disappointed and Fed Chair Jerome Powell dashed hopes of a March interest rate cut. Futures pointed to a rebound Thursday, however. Read more: Microsoft, Alphabet and AMD Struggle to Meet AI Expectations  Apple’s results are top of mind for investors. The Cupertino, California-based company’s shares have reflected concerns over sluggish iPhone sales and its slow-moving approach to artificial intelligence.  Wall Street analysts expect Apple to report about $118 billion in revenue for its first fiscal quarter, 1% higher than the same period a year ago. If the company meets the estimate, it would mark its first revenue expansion after four-consecutive quarters of declining sales. A narrow return to growth would come despite global challenges for Apple, which include Chinese restrictions on foreign technology and antitrust scrutiny in Europe. While the firm earned its reputation as one of the Magnificent Seven of 2023, jumping nearly 50% and hitting a record as recently as December, the stock has struggled this year.  At Amazon, the focus will be on its Amazon Web Services business, as well as expectations for its advertising segment after rolling out ads on the Prime Video service in the US. AWS sales are expected to expand 12% to $24 billion of Amazon’s projected $166 billion in sales for the fourth quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Operating profit is expected to nearly quadruple. Facebook-parent Meta Platforms is expected to deliver revenue of $39 billion in the fourth quarter, a 21% jump from the previous period. Of the three, the stock has posted the biggest gain in 2024, up 10%.

"Tech sector navigating layoffs while riding GenAI wave, says GlobalData",2024-02-09T21:07:14+00:00,https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/tech-sector-navigating-layoffs-while-riding-genai-wave-says-globaldata/558494,"Videos PodcastsBlogsSlideshows The technology industry, says GlobaData, has already witnessed substantial changes in 2024, including layoffs by big companies such as Google, Amazon and Meta, a trend, it adds, that began last year, affecting over 191,000 employees, driven by factors like post-COVID-19 pandemic adjustments and a focus on emerging tech like artificial intelligence (AI). Despite these and other challenges, the data and analytics firm says there is a “positive outlook for AI roles, especially those in customized generative AI solutions and machine learning operations (MLOps). This underscores the dynamic nature of the employment landscape within the technology sector.” Kiran Raj, practice head of Disruptive Tech at GlobalData, said, “in the context of AI jobs, this trend represents a dual narrative. While layoffs create challenges within the tech industry, there is also a growing demand for specialized AI and machine learning talent as these technologies become increasingly integrated into business operations.” This demand, added Raj, is “particularly for generative AI-powered custom applications, catering to specific market needs while enhancing privacy and security.” According to Saurabh Daga, associate project manager of Disruptive Tech, “the shift towards tailored generative AI tools is increasingly evident, catering to the specific market niches and user needs. This approach is particularly advantageous in sectors like healthcare, finance, and legal, enhancing efficiency and privacy.” A release issued this week points out that recent analysis of Global Data’s Job Analytics database “underscores these trends where the job postings related to generative AI (GenAI) have grown by 42 per cent from Q3 2023 to Q4 2023. Moreover, the data points towards a much lower five per cent increase in overall AI-related jobs in the same period. This emphasizes the importance that enterprises are placing on transformative outcomes through generative AI.” In 2024, said Daga, the tech industry stands at a crossroads of transformation and adaptation: “The employment landscape is being shaped by a combination of macroeconomic and technological changes. This dynamic landscape underscores the need for workforce development, hiring, and reskilling to meet the industry’s evolving demands.” Our experienced team of journalists and bloggers bring you engaging in-depth interviews, videos and content targeted to IT professionals and line-of-business executives. © IT World Canada.

Meta shuts down Iranian leader’s accounts for his posts on Hamas and Israel,2024-02-09T20:26:31+00:00,https://www.jta.org/2024/02/09/politics/meta-shuts-down-iranian-leaders-accounts-for-his-posts-on-hamas-and-israel,"I accept the JTA Privacy Policy. By submitting the above I agree to the privacy policy and terms of use of JTA.org (JTA) — Meta has shut down the Instagram and Facebook accounts of Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, “for repeatedly violating our Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy.” The company did not elaborate on its policy, reported Friday by multiple media outlets, but since Oct. 18, 11 days after Hamas terrorists raided Israel and murdered more than 1,200 people and brutalized thousands more, Meta has banned “content containing praise for Hamas, which is designated by Meta as a Dangerous Organization, or violent and graphic content.” Khamenei has since the Oct. 7 raids repeatedly praised the terrorist organization, and anticipated with joy the demise of Israel and of Zionism, on his Meta accounts, as well as on X, the platform owned separately by Elon Musk. “God willing, the cancer of the usurper Zionist regime will be eradicated at the hands of the Palestinian people and the Resistance forces throughout the region,” he posted on Oct. 7, attaching a video of civilians fleeing terrorist attackers. “Never doubt that the hostile, usurper Zionist regime will be wiped off the world’s map one day,” he posted on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, on Dec. 23. His Instagram and Facebook posts are no longer available. The decision comes as Meta, a social media behemoth, is considering how to treat abuses of the term “Zionist,” a development first reported Friday by The Washington Post. “While the term ‘Zionist’ often refers to a person’s ideology, which is not a protected characteristic, it can also be used to refer to Jewish or Israeli people,”  Meta spokeswoman Erin McPike told the Post. “Given the increase in polarized public discourse due to events in the Middle East, we believe it’s important to assess our guidance for reviewing posts that use the term ‘Zionist.’” Jewish groups praised Meta for the ban. “We’ve long asked @Meta to take down the Facebook & Instagram accounts of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei & applaud that it’s finally happened,” Jonathan Greenblatt, the Anti-Defamation League CEO, said on X. “He’s used these platforms for years to incite violent antisemitism, to legitimize militant antizionism and to make genocidal threats. X has not banned Khamenei despite repeated appeals from Jewish groups. Officials of X and other social media have said they generally exempt world leaders from bans because of the newsworthiness of their statements, however vile. Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur, claims to be a free speech absolutist although he has complied with censorship laws in China and other autocracies and has removed content attacking him.

Feb. 9 (UPI) -- Meta removed accounts belonging to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei from its Facebook and Instagram platforms after he was accused of applauding the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.
A Meta spokesperson told CNN that Khamenei's Facebook and Instagram accounts, which are not currently available, had been disabled, meaning they are permanently removed from the platforms.

""We have removed these accounts for repeatedly violating out Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy,"" the spokesperson said.
The policy outlaws individuals and organizations that support terrorism and violence, including those falling under the United States' terrorist organization designation.

Former Iranian government adviser Mohammad Marandi said his account has been suspended by Meta while supporters of Israel have not faced the same scrutiny.
""Many thousands of Iranians, including myself, have had their Facebook and Instagram accounts suspended or deleted,"" he told Middle East Eye. ""So, this isn't unexpected.""
Jonathan Greenblatt with the Anti-Defamation League praised Meta's decision.
""We've long asked Meta to take down the Facebook and Instagram accounts of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and applaud that its finally happened,"" Greenblatt said on X. ""He's used these platforms for years to incite violent anti-semitism, to legitimize militant antizionismand to make genocidal threats.""
Iran also has been blamed for trying to limit and block social media use in support of the government. In 2022, Iran blocked Internet access and messaging app access during a crackdown of countrywide protests over the death of a Mahsa Amini at the hands of its morality police.

Instagram and Threads will no longer ‘proactively’ recommend political content,2024-02-09T17:24:42+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/instagram-and-threads-will-no-longer-proactively-recommend-political-content/,"Meta doesn’t want its new app Threads to become another Twitter, full of heated political debates and the resulting toxicity that entails. In an announcement today, the company detailed how it will approach the recommendation of political content across both Instagram and its sister app, Threads, a competitor to Elon Musk’s X. In short, it will no longer push politics on users. Similar to Meta’s existing policies on Facebook, Instagram and Threads’ recommendation engines now won’t proactively suggest political posts to users by default, the company said on Friday. On Facebook, Meta has reduced the amount of political content that appears in the Feed (formerly News Feed), Reels, Facebook Watch (videos), Groups You Should Join and Pages You May Like recommendations. Now, it’s announcing this same approach will come to Instagram and Reels in the months leading up to the U.S. 2024 elections. In an announcement shared on the Instagram blog and Meta Transparency Center, the company said the changes to Instagram’s app will impact areas like Instagram Reels and Instagram Explore, as well as the In-Feed Recommendations across both Instagram and Threads. With the latter move, Meta is differentiating its new app from Twitter, now called X, in a significant way. Twitter has often been home to political debate, an extension of its function as a real-time news network. But Instagram has been distancing Threads from news, having delayed the addition of a “trends” feature, as X offers. Instagram head Adam Mosseri also specifically stated in October that Threads won’t “amplify news” on its platform. To be clear, Meta’s coming changes impact Instagram’s role in recommending content, but not how it shows content from accounts users already follow, the company said. For example, if an account that’s not eligible for recommendation posts political content, like news about elections, laws or other social topics, that account’s content will still reach its followers via the Feed and Stories. It just won’t be proactively recommended to non-followers. Image Credits: Meta Image Credits: Meta Instagram says professional accounts will be able to use an Account Status feature to check their current eligibility status and can choose to edit or remove posts from this page. They can also request a review if they disagree with Instagram’s decision on a piece of content, or can choose to stop posting content to be eligible for recommendation again. (The company didn’t say how long it would need to refrain from political posts to once again be eligible, however.) In addition, users who do want political content recommended will be able to turn this on in their Settings on both Instagram and Threads. Facebook will also get a similar control at some point in the future. Removing politics from recommendation surfaces and forcing users to toggle it back on if they want to see it are changes that come after years of Meta shouldering the blame for much of the world’s political unrest.

Jennifer Lopez on How Reunion with Ben Affleck Inspired Her ‘This Is Me...

The soul-baring “This Is Me… Now: A Love Story” is loosely based on Lopez’s own journey through relationships that led to her reunion and marriage to the love of her life, Ben Affleck. She told Terri, “It’s very personal and meta, but has some autobiographical things in it. And so, it really was more of a message that I wanted to live with the album.” The album “This Is Me… Now” is J.Lo’s ninth, and features a scorching, too-hot-for-TV remix of her new single ""Can’t Get Enough"" with Latto. Jennifer shared, “The album is kind of a celebration. Kind of capturing the moment in time when I went into the studio to make the album… ‘This Is Me… Now’ is this moment in time and then there was more to say… She went on, “The message of the album is like, ‘If you ever wondered if true love is out there or forever, it kind of exists.’ I think so. I would say yes.” Terri commented, “You are a hopeless romantic,” and she agreed! “Yes! I am, but at the same time, there’s things you need to figure out. And there are things for me being on the journey that I needed to figure out. And I think the… cinematic original that we made, this Amazon Original, is really about that part of it and tells more of the story.” J.Lo's cinematic experience is packed with stars and zodiac signs symbolizing all the loves in her life. It premieres Friday, Feb. 16 on Prime. Fat Joe plays her therapist, and it also features Keke Palmer, Sofía Vergara, Jane Fonda, J.Lo's life coach Jay Shetty, astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, Derek Hough and Trevor Noah, who thought it was a prank when J.Lo called. Lopez explained, “There was all this talk about ‘let’s get Taylor Swift, let’s get Adele,’ you know, all these people. And I was like, ‘I love all of these people, but... it was more random for me, it was kind of people who affected me when I heard them talk about life and love… people whose music had affected me, whose lives had affected me, whose words had affected me, and I knew would understand what I was trying to do with this project… They also had to trust me.” She definitely trusts her husband. Terri asked her about being inspired by her reunion with Ben. J.Lo shared, “I can be creative at any time, but I find with music, for me… it’s more always about love. It’s more about when I’m happy in love. Kind of exploring that topic, the music flows more readily for me.” Jennifer continued, “I know some artists when they’re going through all the heartache and pain, they write all these great records and everything. I’ve never been that person.” She added with a laugh, “I’m the opposite of that person!” Stars arrive at the 2024 CMT Music Awards! See all the pics from inside the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards!

Instagram and Facebook delete the accounts of Iran’s supreme leader,2024-02-09T15:41:39+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/09/instagram-facebook-delete-iran-leader-account,"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei supported Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel, which Meta said violated its policies Meta has removed Instagram and Facebook accounts run on behalf of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, following criticism over his support for Hamas after the group’s 7 October attack on Israel that sparked the months-long war still raging in the Gaza Strip, the company confirmed on Friday. Meta, based in Menlo Park, California, offered no specifics about its reasoning. However, it said it removed the accounts “for repeatedly violating our Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy”. “We do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on our platforms,” the policy states. That includes those designated as terrorists by the US government. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Accounts associated with the supreme leader had been praising the Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw about 250 others taken hostage. Immediately after the attack, Khamenei backed Hamas in a speech, saying: “We kiss the hands of those who planned the attack on the Zionist regime.” Khamenei still maintains an account on X, formerly Twitter. Pressure has been growing on online platforms to remove Khamenei in recent years, particularly after the mass protests that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini after her arrest allegedly over how she wore the mandated headscarf in Iran. Khamenei’s use of Facebook has drawn criticism after he joined in 2012. The social network has been banned in Iran since its 2009 disputed presidential election and the Green Movement protests that followed. Iran began blocking Instagram and Meta’s WhatsApp messaging service after the protests over Amini’s death. Iran has provided arms and support to Hamas, though Tehran is not believed to have directed the 7 October attack. Since then, Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip has killed more than 27,000 Palestinians and sparked tensions across the wider Middle East. Iranian-backed militias such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi rebels have launched attacks against Israel in the time since. Khamenei and his vast patronage network inside Iran have long been targeted by US sanctions – Khamenei himself since 2019 by the administration of then president Donald Trump as tensions began to spiral in the Middle East over Trump unilaterally withdrawing the US from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers.",-2

The New Look to The Vince Staples Show: the seven best shows to stream this week,2024-02-09T07:00:36+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/09/the-new-look-to-the-vince-staples-show-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week,"The Christian Dior biopic is a rich, brilliantly cast look at the rise of Parisian haute couture, while a Californian rapper stars in a kaleidoscopic meta-comedy about his own life According to one admirer at an event looking back on his career, Christian Dior’s 1947 New Look collection “helped humanity find beauty again after the horrors of World War II”. But Todd A Kessler’s lavish drama suggests it wasn’t that simple. During the war, the likes of Dior and Coco Chanel found their positions in occupied Paris deeply compromised: as their wares were coveted by the Germans, self-preservation arguably tipped over into collaboration. With its slightly bizarre French-accented English and melodramatic flouncing, The New Look is never far from cheesy. But it is cheese of a rich, ripe variety, powered by a fine cast including Ben Mendelsohn, Juliette Binoche and John Malkovich. Apple TV+, from Wednesday 14 February Based on Jeff Benedict’s book, this access-all-areas series sees Apple dipping its toes into the world of the sporting documentary. But the story of NFL team New England Patriots is stranger than many fictions. In 1994, they were a laughing stock: almost bankrupt and stuck in a loop of on-field failure. Soon, everything changed. The arrival of head coach Bill Belichick and star player Tom Brady triggered a run of success with six Super Bowl titles. But, as this series shows, that’s nowhere near the whole story; the team’s history includes a controversy about extreme rule-bending and even a player being convicted of murder. Apple TV+, from Friday 16 February Another revealing standup special from Tomlinson, whose unflinching examinations of everything from mental health struggles to romantic disappointments succeed in universalising difficult subjects. As befits a comic who has just slipped neatly into the coveted late-night CBS slot vacated by James Corden’s Late Late Show, Tomlinson’s self-possessed confidence carries her through – as a performer who first cut her teeth on the Christian comedy circuit, she’s well versed in understanding the limits and expectations of an audience, even as she’s subverting them.  Netflix, from Tuesday 13 February Arguably the least romantic dating show in TV history returns for an improbable sixth season. “I want something real,” says one singleton as she prepares to enter a pod on the set of a TV show and talk to a bunch of prospective soulmates without seeing their faces. Of course, she might get lucky – but experience has shown that disappointment, via bouts of shrieking, squawking hysteria is a more likely outcome. As ever, the show is hosted by Marmite couple Nick and Vanessa Lachey, whose sometimes abrasive presenting style adds to the sense of alienation.

This high-profile union leader will protest at Meta’s offices in Cambridge. Here’s why.,2024-02-08T23:56:51+00:00,https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/02/08/this-high-profile-union-leader-is-protesting-at-metas-offices-in-cambridge/,"
								By Molly Farrar  Shawn Fain, the president of United Auto Workers who lead last year’s high profile auto workers strike, will be joining a local union in front of Meta’s offices in Cambridge on Friday, the union said.  Israeli dining operations company Yarzin Sella took over Meta’s office cafeteria last December, and has since refused to match the workers’ previous union contract, UNITE HERE Local 26 said. The workers, including line and prep cooks, dishwashers, and servers, have organized protests twice in front of Meta’s office in Kendall Square. On Friday afternoon, they are planning to protest again – with special guest Fain. Meta is the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Their local office is located on Binney Street. Fain, along with the union, are calling for the cafeteria company to bargain with the union. Without Yarzin Sella adopting the previous contract, more than 20 employees have lost their pension contributions and “face uncertain employment conditions,” the union said.  The union is fighting for comparable wages to Google’s food workers, which are in the same union. Yarzin Sella did not return a request for comment. Stay up to date on all the latest news from Boston.com  ©2024 Boston Globe Media Partners, LLC

Google giveth – bringing Gemini to Canada and Meta threatens to taketh away with a veiled threat against their Montreal workforce if the government regulates AI in a way they don’t like. All this and more on the “nice economy you got there, shame if something should happen to it” edition of Hashtag Trending. I’m your host Jim Love, CIO of IT World Canada and TechNewsDay in the US. I was about to do a story asking if Google was punishing Canada for our government’s insistence that they actually pay Canadian publishers for the news they use and make money from, but then the folks at Google made me eat my (almost) words. Google has announced the launch of its generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbot, Bard, now available in Canada and rebranded as Gemini. So not only are we getting the latest in Google’s AI, but we get in in Canada – no more VPN to pretend we’re American. And Google is offering this to both English and French-speaking Canadians. The rebranding to Gemini seems to indicate that Google is trying to turn a new page and give OpenAI a run for our money. There are various versions to cater to different devices and use cases, including Gemini Nano for smartphone processing and Gemini Ultra for more complex tasks like coding and logical reasoning. And Gemini Advanced is part of the new Google One AI Premium Plan, priced at $26.99 per month CANADIAN. It offers subscribers an integrated AI experience across Google Workspace applications, including Gmail, Docs, Slides, and Sheets. This integration, formerly known as Duet AI, embeds AI into everyday digital experiences, making sophisticated AI tools more accessible to a wider audience. Mobile apps are coming soon, but initially only in English, we hope that French will be coming soon. Sources include: IT World Canada, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has expressed concerns over Canada’s proposed Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA). During a parliamentary hearing, Rachel Curran, head of public policy for Meta Platforms in Canada, voiced that Meta might reconsider launching some of its products in Canada if the proposed AI law remains unchanged. More than that, she said, “Our global AI research is based in Montreal. The wrong regulatory framework, over-reach, or over-regulation by the government would drive that kind of activity out of the country. And I would hate to see that because we are leaders in AI research.” AIDA, part of Bill-C-26, seeks to regulate AI systems by categorizing them into three classes based on their potential impact. The legislation aims to mitigate risks of harm or biased outputs from AI systems, a move that has been met with both support and criticism from the tech industry. While some provisions of AIDA are applauded for their intent to maintain public trust in AI applications, tech leaders, including those from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, have called for mo...",-2
"Meta boots Iran despot Ali Khamenei from Facebook, Instagram after calls to ‘wipe Israel off map’",2024-02-08T21:14:57+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/08/business/irans-supreme-leader-khamenei-booted-from-facebook-instagram/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Meta has suspended the Facebook and Instagram accounts of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei due to what the company calls “repeated violations” of its “dangerous organizations and individuals policy.” Khamenei was booted from the popular social media platforms following his repeated calls to “wipe Israel off the map.” Iran is a sworn enemy of Israel, which has been engaged in warfare against Hamas after the Palestinian terrorist organization’s Oct. 7 assault which left nearly 1,200 people dead. News of Meta’s deactivation of Khamenei’s Facebook and Instagram accounts was first reported by Middle East Eye. Pro-Israel organizations have lobbied social media companies to remove Khamenei’s accounts.  His Persian-language Instagram page had more than 5.1 million followers, while the English-language version had a following of more than 204,000. X, the company formerly known as Twitter, has thus far deactivating Khamenei’s account. The despot has more than 1 million followers on the site. Facebook, Instagram and X are all blocked in Iran, but Khamenei does maintain accounts for audiences outside the country. The Post has sought comment from Meta, X and the government of Iran. Khamenei has referred to Israel and Zionism as “an obvious plague for the world of Islam.”  In 2020, Khamenei referred to Israel as a “cancerous tumor” that “will undoubtedly be uprooted and destroyed.” In the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 7 assault, Khamenei wrote on X: “God willing, the cancer of the usurper Zionist regime will be eradicated at the hands of the Palestinian people and the Resistance forces throughout the region.” X allowed the post to remain despite the fact that it violated its terms of service. “X has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the post to remain accessible,” X wrote in a note attached to Khamenei’s post.

How to charge Meta Quest 3 controllers,2024-02-08T20:00:48+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-charge-meta-quest-3-controllers/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? VR has come a long way, and the Meta Quest 3 continues to move the needle in the right direction for the platform. But while using the Meta Quest 3 is a wireless affair, you’ll still need wires to keep the headset charged up. As such, you may be wondering why you don’t have an option to plug in your controllers. Here’s what you need to know about keeping your Meta Quest 3 controllers powered up. The Meta Quest 3 controllers come out of the box using AA batteries for power, which means that you won’t be able to charge them in their original state. If they run out of power, you’ll simply need to swap out the old AA batteries for some new ones to continue playing games. Of course, you can opt for rechargeable batteries, which is the most sustainable and affordable method. But if you’re absolutely positive you’d like to charge your Meta Quest 3 controllers rather than swap out AA batteries, you can invest in a charging station from Meta. This official Meta Quest 3 Charging Dock provides a tidy place to dock the headset itself, as well as the controllers. The charging dock doesn’t get you around batteries themselves, of course — it simply provides a way to swap the original AA batteries with the rechargeable batteries included with the Charging Dock. These batteries are “genuine Meta batteries” that the company claims will last “hundreds of charging cycles” and even allow you to view the battery level of the controller. If you don’t want to shell out the $130 required to purchase the official Meta Quest 3 Charging Dock, you can find off-brand charging docks for much less money. So, while there’s no way to directly charge the controllers, there are a few different options for keeping your Quest 3 controllers powered up when you need them. Last year Meta released the Quest 3, a $500 VR headset that shares some features of the more expensive Quest Pro. If you'd like to explore virtual reality for games, entertainment, and work, there are several points to consider before making a decision between the Quest 3 and Quest Pro. The operating system and app library are virtually the same. So we need to examine the price, performance, image quality, comfort, and special features to determine the best VR headset and help you identify which is right for your needs. One of the best Meta Quest 2 deals is over at Woot but you’ve only got limited time to grab it. Once it sells out at this price, you’ll miss out. Woot deals tend to be pretty popular so you’ll need to be fast as the Meta Quest 2 is down to just $229. Sounds great, right? Here’s a quick look at what you should expect from it before you hit the buy button. Why you should buy the Meta Quest 2
One of the best VR headsets around even if it’s now been overtaken by the Meta Quest 3, the Meta Quest 2 is a great entry to VR gaming. It has a sleek design with a light and comfortable headset. On the inside is a Qualcomm Sna...",3

Fortnite is winning the metaverse,2024-02-08T18:30:00+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/24065901/fortnite-metaverse-disney-epic-partnership,"By  Andrew Webster, an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. In 2021, Facebook’s parent company got a new name and a new goal. “Over time, I hope we are seen as a metaverse company,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the time. He later called the metaverse “the successor to the mobile internet” and noted that the concept would be so big that it was too much for any one company to take on, spanning an entire industry. That hasn’t happened yet. Even Meta employees barely use the company’s flagship metaverse app, Horizon Worlds, and over the last few years, Zuckerberg’s definition of the metaverse seems to have shifted from a Ready Player One-style virtual world to one that blends the real and the virtual as new buzzwords like AI have taken root. Either way, this vision of the internet hasn’t exactly established itself the way Zuckerberg planned — at least not from Meta. But the metaverse business appears to be booming in Fortnite. Yesterday, Disney invested $1.5 billion in Epic Games, with the goal of creating what it describes as an “expansive and open games and entertainment universe” that’s tied to Fortnite. This comes off of a major restructuring for Fortnite earlier this year in which it shifted from a popular online shooter to a set of connected experiences ranging from a Lego survival game to a Rock Band-style music festival. (This new era began, in true Fortnite fashion, with a huge virtual concert.) Disney previously made its own efforts in the space. In 2022, the company tasked executive Mike White with leading its metaverse efforts, with former CEO Bob Chapek touting “the so-called metaverse, which I believe is the next great storytelling frontier.” A year later, its metaverse division was eliminated as part of a wave of mass layoffs. So what’s the difference? Why haven’t a massive entertainment conglomerate and a massive social network been able to crack the metaverse, but a goofy game where a banana can fight Ariana Grande has? The answer is that, well, it’s a goofy game. Meta and Disney (and every other company chasing the metaverse trend) started with the desire to create a new vision of the internet, an all-encompassing virtual world that could serve as a place to play and to work. But they didn’t give people a reason to want to exist in that space. Fortnite, on the other hand, began as a thing millions of people really wanted to do — play a fun game with characters they know and love — and built its virtual world aspirations on top of that. “We’re not fighting a trend,” Epic executive VP Saxs Persson told me last year. “We’re just trying to broaden something that we already see today in Fortnite. That’s all we’re doing really is doubling down on the things that we know are successful today.” Fortnite’s evolution has been slow...",-2

Super Bowl gambling: Why Utah shouldn’t legalize gambling | Opinion,2024-02-08T16:24:02+00:00,https://www.deseret.com/opinion/2024/2/8/24064117/super-bowl-gambling-laws-addiction,"Utah lawmakers and members of Congress are laser focused on social media and how it affects teenagers and young adults, and rightfully so. Under pressure recently, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg even apologized during a congressional hearing to the families whose children have suffered and died and whose perpetrators were aided by social media and its algorithms. It was a powerful moment, but it made me wonder. When do we get apologies to the victims of an ever-expanding gambling industry and its destructive tactics, aided by artificial intelligence? And why on earth would a conservative state lawmaker be pushing to make a state-run lottery legal in Utah? A growing body of research shows Utahns should be glad their state is one of the few that hasn’t been lured by a lottery’s false promises. The Super Bowl this Sunday will, for the first time, take place in Las Vegas. When I was a reporter there in the 1980s, that was unthinkable. As The New York Times reminded readers a couple of years ago, in 2012 “a lawyer for the NFL argued that the league was adamantly opposed to sports gambling because it would ‘negatively impact our long-term relationship with our fans, negatively impact the perception of our sport across the country.’” Now, you can’t turn on a game without being bombarded every few minutes by advertisements urging you to place bets on games, and even on plays within games. In my time in Las Vegas, the NFL treated the city as if it were possessed with a highly contagious disease. Now, it has a team in the city and welcomes all bettors, except active players or team employees, of course. ESPN cited American Gaming Association estimates that Americans may wager $23.1 billion on Sunday’s game, with 26% of all adults making bets. Despite the denials from gambling companies, to pretend gambling’s antisocial dangers, so evident in the past, have suddenly disappeared, is as ridiculous as pretending that gambling itself hasn’t surged because of all the ads. To couch this in terms of personal liberty is as tone deaf as to say the Founding Fathers sacrificed all so that we could play games of chance in our pajamas. Last weekend, the CBS show “60 Minutes” did a report on all this that included the startling fact that “there is no federal funding for gambling research,” meaning that Washington isn’t interested in gathering data about how unleashing a barrage of sports betting on the public has affected public health. “60 Minutes” interviewed Harry Levant, a reformed gambler and a therapist who specializes in gambling addictions. Sports gambling companies use algorithms fueled by artificial intelligence to produce odds and to draw people in, he said.  Levant said smartphones have fueled gambling addictions. “I have patients who gamble in the shower. I have patients who gamble before they get out of bed in the morning. I have patients who gamble while they are driving,” he said. “There are no guardrails.” The proponents of sports gambling will claim Americans...",-2
"Meta may not bring some products to Canada unless proposed AI law changed, Parliament told",2024-02-08T16:06:20+00:00,https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/meta-may-not-bring-some-products-to-canada-unless-proposed-ai-law-changed-parliament-told/558406,"Videos PodcastsBlogsSlideshows Officials from four of the biggest tech companies in the world — Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta — largely offered polite criticism of the country’s proposed artificial intelligence law to Canadian parliamentarians for over an hour at a hearing Wednesday. Several agreed the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA) legislation should be passed quickly, but with certain provisions more clearly defined, and allowing more rules to be set in regulations than in the law so it will be flexible. And then it was like a mask dropped. It came after Microsoft Canada’s Amanda Craig, the company’s senior director of public policy in the office of responsible AI, gave a lengthy explanation of things that could be improved. Then Rachel Curran, head of public policy for Meta Platforms in Canada, was asked to comment. “I think Amanda is being very diplomatic,” she told the House of Commons industry committee. “AIDA in a number of respects goes well beyond the most stringent proposal out there internationally, which is the EU Act — which is already the subject of a lot of debate amongst [European Union] member states. It doesn’t have the support of countries like France, for instance, who want to make sure their own domestic industry is given a chance to flourish. So AIDA has created a standard that doesn’t exist anywhere else in the world.” If AIDA passes as is, Meta could meet its requirements for regulating AI systems, she said. But, Curran added “the compliance costs are incredibly high. Would that mean certain [Meta] products would not be launched in Canada? Maybe. But all of us work for companies that are able to meet very high [regulatory] thresholds because we have the resources and money to do that.” On the other hand, “it’s going to have a significant impact on the Canadian AI industry and on innovation in Canada. “Canada should make sure it aligns itself [in AI legislation] with other jurisdictions. We’re a relatively small market. The EU is setting a benchmark that is world-leading. We should at the very least not exceed that.” Passing AI legislation fast is important, Curran said, if only to maintain public trust in artificial intelligence applications. But, she added, it’s also important to get the legislation right. AIDA is “a pretty good bill,” she said at one point. “It’s just a question of whether we can get the good details right.” But, at another point, she said this: “Our global AI research is based in Montreal. The wrong regulatory framework, over-reach, or over-regulation by the government would drive that kind of activity out of the country. And I would hate to see that because we are leaders in AI research.” Nicole Foster, director of Amazon Web Services’ global artificial intelligence and Canada public policy, agreed with Curran on the need to not get ahead of other countries. At the very least, she added, MPs should hear the opinions on the impact of AIDA from Canadian firms who are, or will be, using ...",-2
Zakerberg prvi put isplaćuje dividende! Ima i onih koji će se obogatiti,2024-02-08T12:17:11+00:00,https://biznis.telegraf.rs/it-biz/3832345-zakerberg-prvi-put-isplacuje-dividende-ima-i-onih-koji-ce-se-obogatiti,"Vreme čitanja: oko 1 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 1 min. Mark Zakerberg iznenadio je javnost kada se na saslušanju u američkom Senatu posvećenom internet bezbednosti dece javno izvinio porodicama koje su pretrpele ""bilo kakvu vrstu štete ili boli"" zbog prakse koju njegova kompanija Meta primenjuje na društvenim mrežama koje su joj u vlasništvu. Samo nekoliko dana kasnije, stiže novo iznenađenje: Zakerbergova Meta će prvi put isplatiti dividende, što će neke deoničare učiniti bogatašima. Tehnološki gigant u vlasništvu ima Instagram, Facebook i WhatsApp. U saopštenju za javnost Zakerberg je rast poslovanja u prošloj godini pripisao azvršetku inicijative za Centre podataka, otpuštanju 10.000 radnika i unapređenju vešetačke inteligencije i metaverzuma. Metina ""godina efikasnosti"" koju je Zakerberg osmislio u martu prošle godine, dobro se isplatila deoničarima, piše BBC. Ako je verovati saopštenju za medije, Upravni odbor Mete najavio je dividendu od od 0.50 dolara za svaku redovnu deonicu klase A i klase B, a isplata će biti obavljena 26. marta ove godine. Nakon toga, svaka tri meseca dividende će biti isplaćivani dokle god za to postoje tržišni uslovi (čitaj - zarada). Isplata će imati najveći uticaj na Vangard grupu i BlekRok, koji su najveći deoničari, ali i na Majkla Šrepfera i Dejvida Fišera - tehničkog i finansijskog direktora Mete. Zakerberg će zaraditi oko 175 miliona dolara kroz ovu isplatu, s obzirom na to da poseduje deonice Mete vredne 350 miliona dolara, javlja hrvatski Index. Potez koji je povukao pionir društvenih mreža naišao je na opštu podršku kod investitora i na tržištu: posle najave o isplati dividendi, deonice kompanije porasle su za 20%, a otkupljeno je čak 50 milijardi dolara deonica kompanije Meta. Ova isplata predstavlja distanciranje od Metine dosadašnje norme držanja velikih novčanih rezervi za preuzimanje drugih kompanija ili finansiranje istraživanja i razvoja.

Meta challenges EU’s Digital Services Act supervisory fee as unfair,2024-02-08T11:16:35+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/08/meta-challenge-dsa-fee/,"Meta is challenging a fee levied by the European Union on larger online platforms under its rebooted e-commerce rules. While a number of tech giants have taken issue with their designations under the law, this is the first suit that’s focused on the supervisory fee. The news of Meta’s legal challenge was first reported yesterday by Politico. Update: Per Reuters, TikTok has followed Meta and is also challenging the supervisory fee — with a spokesperson telling the news agency it disagrees with it on “a number of grounds,” including what it described as “flawed third party estimates of our monthly active user numbers as a basis for calculating the total amount.” The EU Digital Services Act (DSA), which goes fully into force on in-scope digital services later this month but is already being applied on a subset of larger platform providers like Meta, makes a provision for charging these so-called very large online platforms (VLOPs) and very large online search engines (VLOSE) to help fund the cost of the bloc’s oversight of their businesses. The regulation stipulates that the amount charged annually should take into account the costs incurred by the European Commission, which is the primary enforcer of the DSA on VLOPs and VLOSE, and should be “proportionate” to the size of the service (based on average active monthly regional users) and also factor in the provider’s “economic capacity,” or that of the designated service (or services) they offer. (In Meta’s case, it provides two services that are designated under the DSA: its social networks, Facebook and Instagram.) Per the Commission, the total pot of supervisory fees it has collected from VLOPs/VLOSE for 2023 is €45.24 million (~$48.7 million). The EU is not reporting per company fee payments. But TechCrunch understands Meta’s contribution to that total is just under a quarter — or around €11 million. Google, which is the tech giant with the most services designated under the DSA, is contributing the most — almost half (circa €22 million). Other VLOPs/VLOSE account for smaller amounts (e.g., TikTok is paying about 8.5% or €3.8 million; Apple €3 million; Microsoft €2.7 million; Booking.com €1.45 million). But there are a handful of designated platforms that aren’t paying anything in the first round as they reported a loss during the preceding financial year — including Amazon, Pinterest, Snapchat and Wikimedia. The DSA puts an overall cap on the level of annual fees the EU can charge VLOPs/VLOSE — which cannot exceed 0.05% of the worldwide annual net income of the preceding financial year, per Article 43 of the regulation. (In Meta’s case, the company’s full year 2022 revenue was $116.61 billion, implying a maximum possible fee of ~$58.3 million — well below what we understand it has actually been charged under the regulation’s fee calculation mechanism.) The EU says the existence of this cap means that if a company has reported a loss during the preceding financial year, it does not have to pay th...",-1
Meta’s not happy with its bill for enforcing the EU’s tough new DSA,2024-02-08T10:07:28+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065809/meta-european-union-digital-services-act-monitoring-compliance-charge-challenge,"By  Jon Porter, a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards. Meta and TikTok are challenging fees they must pay EU regulators tasked with enforcing tough new content moderation rules required by the Digital Services Act (DSA), both companies have confirmed to The Verge. Although the fee is capped at 0.05 percent of a company’s profits, Meta isn’t happy that loss-making companies won’t have to pay while it’s on the hook for a reported €11 million, while TikTok is also taking issue with how its user numbers have been calculated to work out its reported €3.9 million fee. “We disagree with the methodology used to calculate these fees,” Meta’s EMEA policy comms spokesperson Ben Walters tells The Verge. “Currently, companies that record a loss don’t have to pay, even if they have a large user base or represent a greater regulatory burden, which means some companies pay nothing, leaving others to pay a disproportionate amount of the total.” The challenge was first reported by Politico. “Some companies pay nothing, leaving others to pay a disproportionate amount of the total” “We disagree with the fee and are appealing on a number of grounds, including the use of flawed third party estimates of our monthly active user numbers as a basis for calculating the total amount,” TikTok’s director of corporate and policy communications Morgan Evans tells The Verge.  Under the DSA, the 20 companies identified as very large online platforms (VLOPs) are expected to fund the bloc’s enforcement of the new moderation rules. Meta and TikTok have been labeled as VLOPs because they have at least 45 million monthly active users in the EU. The DSA divvies up enforcement costs so that companies with the most users pay more, unless they were unprofitable. Meta and Google’s parent company Alphabet are believed to be on the hook to pay around three quarters of the €45.2 million (around $48.7 million) annual enforcement bill. That works out to €11 million (around $11.9 million) for Meta and €22.1 million (around $23.8 million) for Alphabet, according to a Bloomberg report last year, while TikTok’s fee was reportedly the third highest at €3.9 million (around $4.2 million). But because the fee is capped at 0.05 percent of a company’s annual global profits in 2022, companies like Amazon and X were likely to pay nothing despite consuming EU resources required to monitor and enforce DSA compliance. X, for example, is under official investigation by the European Commission over concerns that the company previously known as Twitter may have broken the DSA’s rules by failing to prevent “the dissemination of illegal content in the context of Hamas’ terrorist attacks against Israel.” Responding to Meta’s legal challenge, a European Commission spokesperson told Barrons that companies have a right to appeal, but insisted that its “decision and methodology are solid,” and said it will defend its position...",-2

As a result, Meta announced several efforts regarding AI-generated images to help combat the misinformation.  On Tuesday, Meta announced via a blog post that in the upcoming months, it will be adding new labels across Instagram, Facebook, and Threads that indicate when an image was AI-generated.  Also: I just tried Google's ImageFX AI image generator, and I'm shocked at how good it is Meta is currently working with industry partners to determine common technical standards that signal when content was created using generative AI. Then, by using those signals, Meta is building a capability that issues labels in all languages on posts across its platforms, delineating that the image was AI-generated, as seen in the photo at the top of the article. ""As the difference between human and synthetic content gets blurred, people want to know where the boundary lies,"" said Nick Clegg, Meta president of global affairs. ""So it's important that we help people know when photorealistic content they're seeing has been created using AI."" This labeling would work similarly to TikTok's AI-generated content labels, released in September, that appear on TikTok videos containing realistic images, audio, or videos that were AI-generated.  Also: The best AI image generators Meta includes visible markers, invisible watermarks, and IPTC metadata embedded in each image generated using Meta AI's photogeneration capabilities. The company then labels those images with an ""Imagined by AI"" label to designate they were artificially created.  Meta shares that it is building industry-leading tools that can detect invisible watermarks, such as IPTC metadata, in images generated by AI generators from different companies. These include Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Adobe, Midjourney, and Shutterstock, to include AI labels for those images as well.  Of course, this leaves a loophole for malicious actors. If the company doesn't comply with adding metadata to its AI image generator, Meta will have no way of tagging the image with the label. Still, it seems to be a step in the right direction.  Despite the efforts of companies to include signals on AI-generated images, the same effort has yet to be made regarding AI-generated videos and audio. In the meantime, Meta is adding a feature in which people can disclose that they used AI to generate an image so that Meta could add a label.  Also: The ethics of generative AI: How we can harness this powerful technology The company is enforcing voluntary disclosure by threatening to add penalties if a user fails to disclose. The company also retains the ability to add a more prominent label to images, audio, or videos that create a particularly high risk of deceiving the public.  ""We'll require people to use this disclosure and label tool when they post o...",2
How Twitter’s descent into chaos is paving the way for a new web,2024-02-07T22:06:24+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/07/how-twitters-descent-into-chaos-is-paving-the-way-for-a-new-web/,"The post-Twitter era has spurred the development and further growth of numerous social networks that prioritize brief posts, from open source standbys like Mastodon to new decentralized concepts like Bluesky, and those from smaller startups like Post, Spill, and Spoutible, to those from tech giants like Meta, which launched the Twitter-like Threads. While this is great news for people looking for a new place to land after Twitter’s demise (the network under Elon Musk is now called X and headed in a different direction), it’s a challenge for early adopters who want to experiment with new apps and services. Not everyone is satisfied with X’s current course. Though a top-ranked app today, it’s not the Twitter of years past. X takes a lax approach to content moderation, leaving advertisers and some users in search of new options. Even its owner dabbles in antisemitism and trolling, prompting more of the same from the user base. As top advertisers fled, X’s ads became worse and more spammy. Elon Musk says ‘go f*ck yourself’ to advertisers leaving X  The changes at X have been swift and troublesome, leading to a flurry of activity in the social sphere as X alternatives emerged. But now there’s too much of a good thing. The Twitter diaspora, so to speak, is hungry for a solution to save them from having to browse content from across half a dozen apps, in addition to the news websites, blogs, and other information sources they already consume while online. That problem is now being addressed by another group of developers — those who aren’t trying to re-create Twitter or improve upon it, but solve the problem of there being “too many Twitters” to keep up with. Last week, we reported on Tapestry, a new project from The Iconfactory, the app development shop best known for its work on the early Twitter client Twitterrific. Recently funded on Kickstarter after only showing off its prototype build, Tapestry aims to offer a unified app for tracking social media, news, and RSS feeds in one place. That includes posts from X, Bluesky, Mastodon, Tumblr, and others in the future, like perhaps Threads. The Iconfactory was only looking to raise $100,000 to start development of the new app. It was fully funded as of February 5 and has since exceeded that, which allows it to now chase stretch goals of $150,000 and up, which would fund additional features for the app, like muting, filtering, search, bookmarking, and more. Image Credits: The Iconfactory Image Credits: The Iconfactory The Iconfactory isn’t the only developer who has seized on this moment to develop a new multi-service social app. The developer behind the popular Mac and iOS newsreader app Reeder, Silvio Rizzi, is now working on something of a Reeder replacement. Though Rizzi says Reeder will continue to be supported, the new project aims to offer more than just news feeds. In an announcement on Mastodon last week, the developer teased plans for an app that’s “not just an RSS reader,” but instead a tool th...",2

			Trending:		 SAN FRANCISCO — In September, Amazon said it would invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a San Francisco startup working on artificial intelligence. Soon after, an Amazon executive sent a private message to an executive at another company. He said Anthropic had won the deal because it agreed to build its AI using specialized computer chips designed by Amazon. Amazon, he wrote, wanted to create a viable competitor to the chipmaker Nvidia, a key partner and kingmaker in the all-important field of AI. The boom in generative AI over the past year exposed just how dependent big tech companies had become on Nvidia. They cannot build chatbots and other AI systems without a special kind of chip that Nvidia has mastered over the past several years. They have spent billions of dollars on Nvidia’s systems, and the chipmaker has not kept up with the demand. So Amazon and other giants of the industry — including Google, Meta and Microsoft — are building AI chips of their own. With these chips, the tech giants could control their own destiny. They could rein in costs, eliminate chip shortages and eventually sell access to their chips to businesses that use their cloud services. While Nvidia sold 2.5 million chips last year, Google spent $2 billion to $3 billion building about 1 million of its own AI chips, said Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at New Street Research. Amazon spent $200 million on 100,000 chips last year, he estimated. Microsoft said it had begun testing its first AI chip. But this work is a balancing act between competing with Nvidia while working closely with the chipmaker and its increasingly powerful CEO, Jensen Huang. Huang’s company accounts for more than 70% of AI chip sales, according to research firm Omdia. It supplies an even larger percentage of the systems used in the creation of generative AI. Nvidia’s sales have shot up 206% over the past year, and the company has added about $1 trillion in market value. What is revenue to Nvidia is a cost for the tech giants. Orders from Microsoft and Meta made up about one-fourth of Nvidia’s sales in the past two full quarters, said Gil Luria, an analyst at the investment bank D.A. Davidson. Nvidia sells its chips for about $15,000 each, while Google spends an average of just $2,000 to $3,000 on each of its own, according to Ferragu. “When they encountered a vendor that held them over a barrel, they reacted very strongly,” Luria said. Companies constantly court Huang, jockeying to be at the front of the line for his chips. He regularly appears on event stages with their CEOs, and the companies are quick to say they remain committed to their partnerships with Nvidia. They all plan to keep offering its chips alongside their own. While the big tech companies are moving into Nvidia’s business, it is moving into theirs. Last year, Nvidia started its own cloud service where b...",2
"OpenAI, Meta and other tech giants sign effort to fight AI election interference",2024-02-17T12:07:49+00:00,https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/openai-meta-and-other-tech-giants-sign-effort-to-fight-ai-election-interference-417935-2024-02-17?utm_source=rssfeed,"Feedback In a landmark move announced on Friday, a consortium of 20 leading technology firms unveiled a collaborative effort aimed at thwarting deceptive artificial intelligence (AI) content that threatens to manipulate elections worldwide this year. The proliferation of generative AI, capable of swiftly crafting text, images, and video based on prompts, has fuelled concerns over its potential misuse to influence pivotal electoral outcomes. With over half of the global population poised to participate in upcoming polls, apprehensions surrounding AI-driven interference loom large. The tech pact, unveiled at the prestigious Munich Security Conference, boasts an impressive array of signatories. Among them are industry titans at the forefront of developing generative AI models, including OpenAI, Microsoft, and Adobe. Social media juggernauts like Meta Platforms, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) have also pledged their commitment, recognising the imperative of curbing harmful content on their platforms. Central to the accord are concerted efforts to devise tools for detecting and countering misleading AI-generated content across various formats, including images, video, and audio. Additionally, plans encompass widespread public awareness campaigns aimed at educating voters on discerning deceptive content, alongside decisive action to mitigate its dissemination on digital platforms. Technological solutions envisaged to combat AI-generated deception may encompass watermarking and metadata embedding, as outlined by the participating companies. However, the timeline for fulfilling these commitments and the specific modalities for their implementation remain unspecified. Nick Clegg, President of Global Affairs at Meta Platforms, underscored the significance of collective action, asserting, ""The utility of this accord lies in the breadth of its signatories."" Emphasising the need for a unified approach, Clegg cautioned against disparate efforts yielding a fragmented response to the burgeoning threat. Already, instances of generative AI being harnessed to sway political sentiment have surfaced. In January, voters in New Hampshire were targeted with a robocall featuring fabricated audio of US President Joe Biden, urging them to abstain from participating in the state's primary election. Despite the popularity of text-generation tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT, the coalition's focus remains steadfastly on combating the adverse ramifications of AI-driven visuals and audio. Dana Rao, Chief Trust Officer at Adobe, elucidated on this stance, citing the inherent credibility attributed to multimedia content by the human psyche. ""As opposed to text, there exists an emotional resonance with audio, video, and images,"" Rao observed. ""Our brains are predisposed to accord greater credence to such media.""

EU privacy watchdogs urged to oppose Meta’s paid ad-free service,2024-02-17T09:00:00+00:00,https://cde.news/eu-privacy-watchdogs-urged-to-oppose-metas-paid-ad-free-service/,"By Foo Yun Chee BRUSSELS, (Reuters) – Europe’s privacy enforcers should oppose Meta Platforms’ paid no-ads subscription service launched in Europe last November because it requires users to pay a fee to ensure their privacy, a model likely to be copied by other companies, a group of 28 organisations said on Friday. The joint letter by privacy activist Max Schrems’ advocacy group NOYB, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Wikimedia Europe, the Electronic Privacy Information Centre and others to the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) came as the EDPB prepares to issue guidance in the coming weeks on the consent or pay model. This followed a request from the Dutch, Norwegian and Hamburg privacy watchdogs to the EU privacy regulator for an opinion. Meta has said the service that applies to Facebook and Instagram aims to comply with EU rules to give users a choice whether their data can be collected and used for targeted ads. Users who consent to be tracked get a free service which is funded by advertising revenues. “If ‘pay or okay’ is permitted, it will not be limited to news pages or social networks but will be employed by any industry sector with an ability to monetise personal data via consent,” the 28 organisations said in the letter. “In practice, this would successfully undermine the GDPR, the high European data protection standard and wash away all realistic protections against surveillance capitalism,” they said, referring to the EU landmark privacy rules adopted in 2016. “We believe that Meta, and other companies likely to follow suit, are cognizant of the fact that a majority of users will neither be able nor willing to pay a fee.” Subscribe now to keep reading and get access to the full archive.

Meta Wants to Make it Harder to See Political Content On Threads. What Does that Even Mean?,2024-02-16T23:04:45+00:00,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/02/meta-wants-to-make-it-harder-to-see-political-content-on-threads-what-does-that-even-mean/,"AP/Jaap Arriens Earlier this week, Meta decided to create the grandest of Gordian knots for itself when Adam Mosseri, its executive in charge of Instagram and Threads, announced that the company doesn’t want Threads to “proactively amplify political content from accounts you don’t follow”—in effect, announcing the company hopes to limit how “political” content is spread and shared.  Given the boundless and ill-defined nature of politics, his plan seems nearly impossible to implement. Mosseri did not say the plan was to tone down “content involving electoral politics,” or even something as vague as “turning the volume down on toxic politics.” He referred only to leashing the vast but vague category of  “political content.”  Billionaire Mark Cuban did ask Mosseri on threads what Meta means when it says “political content.” But Mosseri never replied. When CNN’s Oliver Darcy pressed the company, he received a written reply: “Informed by research, our definition of political content is content likely to be about topics related to government or elections; for example, posts about laws, elections, or social topics,” with the caveat that “global issues are complex and dynamic, which means this definition will evolve.”  In effect, Mosseri was asking users of Threads to stick to dumb posts—nothing that would, actually, have to be moderated. It reminded me of the edict at the old Deadspin to “stick to sports.” Jim Spanfeller, the CEO of the blog’s new parent company, demanded that of staff, telling them to not write about politics. Apart from bad business, it quickly didn’t make any sense. Sure, you can write a story about Tiger Woods without contextualizing what it means for a Black man to dominate the whitest sport, but it would be stupid. And the only way to avoid politics in writing about the scandal that ensued when the then-Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protests would be not to write about it at all. The cynical read is that politics being ill-defined is the point. Anything annoying for them to deal with, that could even tenuously be described as “political,” can be contained by limiting its algorithmic boost. But we all know how quickly that paradigm will fall. It has been said so much that it’s almost trite to note, but opting out of politics altogether is not, really, possible.  What a tech platform says is, for example, politics. Did Mosseri make sure to not “proactively amplify” his own post? And, for many on the right, the existence of queer people teaching kids amounts to politics. Something as simple as existing as a person who is homeless, poor, a woman, transgender, queer, Black, Asian, or working class can be dubbed “political content.” The even more cynical read is that Meta is trying, metaphorically speaking, to preemptively kill a digital Oedipus by preventing, Threads, the app it spawned, from being weaponized against it. If we can just keep politics off here, we won’t have all those pol...",-2

"Yes, Threads is running a fact-checking program, but the system isn’t fully rolled out",2024-02-16T20:16:31+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/yes-threads-is-running-a-fact-checking-program-but-the-system-isnt-fully-rolled-out/,"Threads, Meta’s Twitter-like service and competitor to X, may be distancing itself from politics, but that doesn’t mean it won’t try to tackle the misinformation that spreads across social media — particularly in the lead-up to national elections. Following user reports of fact-checks spotted on the network, the company confirmed it’s engaged with fact-checking organizations to address false information circulating on Threads, but has not fully rolled out direct fact-checking of Threads content as of yet. Meta had announced in December that in early 2024 its fact-checking partners would be able to review and rate false content directly on Threads. In the meantime, Meta was only able to match existing fact-checks to “near-identical content on Threads,” it said. From the looks of the users’ reports of fact-checking now appearing on Threads, it’s a case of matched ratings, not the more anticipated direct fact-checking of Threads content that people are seeing. The company confirmed this was the case, telling TechCrunch that it hasn’t finalized the ability for fact-checkers to rate content directly on Threads yet, but would soon.     
Threads users had noticed that warning labels appeared on posts — in one case, both as an interstitial over a false AI-generated video and as a pop-up that appeared from the bottom of the screen. The warning message reads “False Information,” followed by an explanation that “the same false information was reviewed in another thread by fact-checkers. There may be small differences.” It also then noted that “independent fact-checkers say this information has no basis in fact,” and documents which fact-checking sources came to this conclusion. Below this, users can read the name of the fact-checking organizations, and the sources’ conclusion — e.g. “False” — along with additional information about the content and why it’s false. Image Credits: Threads screenshot Image Credits: Threads screenshot One example of this fact-check can be viewed here on Threads. It relates to a video that had been circulating in Telegram chats, which claims to be from a France 24 broadcast. However, the video had never aired or even been made — it was AI-generated, the fact-checking organizations both state. In our tests, the fact-check did initially hide the Threads post with the video but offered a “See Post” button to click through and view it. You could optionally tap on “See why” if you wanted to know why it was being hidden for false information. The feature feels a bit underdeveloped, however, as the links to fact-checking websites only worked on mobile, not desktop, and the informational warning below the video, once viewed, was in small text that could be easily missed. Image Credits: Threads screenshot Image Credits: Threads screenshot Though full fact-checking capabilities have not yet rolled out to Threads, when they do the feature will differentiate Threads from its rival X, where fact-checks are now largely managed via crowdsourcin...",2
Tech giants sign voluntary pledge to fight election-related deepfakes,2024-02-16T19:55:45+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/tech-giants-sign-voluntary-pledge-to-fight-election-related-deepfakes/,"Tech companies are pledging to fight election-related deepfakes as policymakers amp up pressure. Today at the Munich Security Conference, vendors including Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon, Adobe and IBM signed an accord signaling their intention to adopt a common framework for responding to AI-generated deepfakes intended to mislead voters. Thirteen other companies, including AI startups OpenAI, Anthropic, Inflection AI, ElevenLabs and Stability AI and social media platforms X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and Snap, joined in signing the accord, along with chipmaker Arm and security firms McAfee and TrendMicro. The undersigned said they’ll use methods to detect and label misleading political deepfakes when they’re created and distributed on their platforms, sharing best practices with one another and providing “swift and proportionate responses” when deepfakes start to spread. The companies added that they’ll pay special attention to context in responding to deepfakes, aiming to “[safeguard] educational, documentary, artistic, satirical and political expression” while maintaining transparency with users about their policies on deceptive election content. The accord is effectively toothless and, some critics may say, amounts to little more than virtue signaling — its measures are voluntary. But the ballyhooing shows a wariness among the tech sector of regulatory crosshairs as they pertain to elections, in a year when 49% of the world’s population will head to the polls in national elections. “There’s no way the tech sector can protect elections by itself from this new type of electoral abuse,” Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, said in a press release. “As we look to the future, it seems to those of us who work at Microsoft that we’ll also need new forms of multistakeholder action … It’s abundantly clear that the protection of elections [will require] that we all work together.” No federal law in the U.S. bans deepfakes, election-related or otherwise. But 10 states around the country have enacted statutes criminalizing them, with Minnesota’s being the first to target deepfakes used in political campaigning. Elsewhere, federal agencies have taken what enforcement action they can to combat the spread of deepfakes. This week, the FTC announced that it’s seeking to modify an existing rule that bans the impersonation of businesses or government agencies to cover all consumers, including politicians. And the FCC moved to make AI-voiced robocalls illegal by reinterpreting a rule that prohibits artificial and prerecorded voice message spam. In the European Union, the bloc’s AI Act would require all AI-generated content to be clearly labeled as such. The EU’s also using its Digital Services Act to force the tech industry to curb deepfakes in various forms. Deepfakes continue to proliferate, meanwhile. According to data from Clarity, a deepfake detection firm, the number of deepfakes that have been created increased 900% year over year. Last mo...",1

				If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.			 Major technology companies signed a pact Friday to voluntarily adopt “reasonable precautions” to prevent artificial intelligence tools from being used to disrupt democratic elections around the world. Tech executives from Adobe, Amazon, Google, IBM, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and TikTok gathered at the Munich Security Conference to announce a new voluntary framework for how they will respond to AI-generated deepfakes that deliberately trick voters. Twelve other companies — including Elon Musk’s X — are also signing on to the accord. “Everybody recognizes that no one tech company, no one government, no one civil society organization is able to deal with the advent of this technology and its possible nefarious use on their own,” said Nick Clegg, president of global affairs for Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, in an interview ahead of the summit. The accord is largely symbolic, but targets increasingly realistic AI-generated images, audio and video “that deceptively fake or alter the appearance, voice, or actions of political candidates, election officials, and other key stakeholders in a democratic election, or that provide false information to voters about when, where, and how they can lawfully vote.” The companies aren’t committing to ban or remove deepfakes. Instead, the accord outlines methods they will use to try to detect and label deceptive AI content when it is created or distributed on their platforms. It notes the companies will share best practices with each other and provide “swift and proportionate responses” when that content starts to spread. The vagueness of the commitments and lack of any binding requirements likely helped win over a diverse swath of companies, but may disappoint pro-democracy activists and watchdogs looking for stronger assurances. “The language isn’t quite as strong as one might have expected,” said Rachel Orey, senior associate director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “I think we should give credit where credit is due, and acknowledge that the companies do have a vested interest in their tools not being used to undermine free and fair elections. That said, it is voluntary, and we’ll be keeping an eye on whether they follow through.” Clegg said each company “quite rightly has its own set of content policies.” She stressed the seriousness of the issue, saying the “combination of AI serving the purposes of disinformation and disinformation campaigns might be the end of democracy, not only in the EU member states.” The agreement at the German city’s annual security meeting comes as more than 50 countries are due to hold national elections in 2024. Some have already done so, including Bangladesh, Taiwan, Pakistan, and most recently Indonesia. Attempts at AI-generated election inte...",0

The vagueness of the commitments and lack of any binding requirements likely helped win over a diverse swath of companies, but may disappoint pro-democracy activists and watchdogs looking for stronger assurances. “The language isn’t quite as strong as one might have expected,” said Rachel Orey, senior associate director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “I think we should give credit where credit is due, and acknowledge that the companies do have a vested interest in their tools not being used to undermine free and fair elections. That said, it is voluntary, and we’ll be keeping an eye on whether they follow through.” Clegg said each company “quite rightly has its own set of content policies.” She stressed the seriousness of the issue, saying the “combination of AI serving the purposes of disinformation and disinformation campaigns might be the end of democracy, not only in the EU member states.” The agreement at the German city’s annual security meeting comes as more than 50 countries are due to hold national elections in 2024.

			Trending:		 By MATT O’BRIEN and ALI SWENSON | Associated Press Major technology companies signed a pact Friday to voluntarily adopt “reasonable precautions” to prevent artificial intelligence tools from being used to disrupt democratic elections around the world. Tech executives from Adobe, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and TikTok gathered at the Munich Security Conference to announce a new voluntary framework for how they will respond to AI-generated deepfakes that deliberately trick voters. Thirteen other companies — including IBM and Elon Musk’s X — are also signing on to the accord. “Everybody recognizes that no one tech company, no one government, no one civil society organization is able to deal with the advent of this technology and its possible nefarious use on their own,” said Nick Clegg, president of global affairs for Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, in an interview ahead of the summit. The accord is largely symbolic, but targets increasingly realistic AI-generated images, audio and video “that deceptively fake or alter the appearance, voice, or actions of political candidates, election officials, and other key stakeholders in a democratic election, or that provide false information to voters about when, where, and how they can lawfully vote.” The companies aren’t committing to ban or remove deepfakes. Instead, the accord outlines methods they will use to try to detect and label deceptive AI content when it is created or distributed on their platforms. It notes the companies will share best practices with each other and provide “swift and proportionate responses” when that content starts to spread. The vagueness of the commitments and lack of any binding requirements likely helped win over a diverse swath of companies, but may disappoint pro-democracy activists and watchdogs looking for stronger assurances. “Every company quite rightly has its own set of content policies,” Clegg said. “This is not attempting to try to impose a straitjacket on everybody. And in any event, no one in the industry thinks that you can deal with a whole new technological paradigm by sweeping things under the rug and trying to play whack-a-mole and finding everything that you think may mislead someone.” The agreement at the German city’s annual security meeting comes as more than 50 countries are due to hold national elections in 2024. Some have already done so, including Bangladesh, Taiwan, Pakistan, and most recently Indonesia. Attempts at AI-generated election interference have already begun, such as when AI robocalls that mimicked U.S. President Joe Biden’s voice tried to discourage people from voting in New Hampshire’s primary election last month. Just days before Slovakia’s elections in November, AI-generated audio recordings impersonated a liberal candidate discussing plans to raise beer pri...",2

Meta Quest Pro VR headset just got an 11% price cut,2024-02-16T14:32:00+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/meta-quest-pro-vr-headset-deal-amazon-february-2024/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? The Meta Quest 3 is on its way to claim its spot among the best VR headsets when it launches on Oct. 10. However, you can already start taking advantage of Meta Quest 3 deals ahead of the device’s release. We’ve spotted the top offers for the VR headset right now, and it’s highly recommended that you take advantage of them before they get sold out. If you buy the 128GB model of the Meta Quest 3 for its sticker price of $500 from Best Buy, you’ll also get a copy of Asgard’s Wrath II. In this sequel to one of the most critically acclaimed VR games, you’ll be battling gods and monsters in an epic action RPG using unique weapons and different combat styles. The VR headset comes with a pair of Touch Plus controllers with wrist straps.  The 512GB model of the Meta Quest 3 is available for pre-order from Best Buy for $650. Not only does it come with a pair of Touch Plus controllers and Asgard’s Wrath II, you’ll also receive a free six-month trial of Meta Quest+, a subscription service that will give you two VR games to play every month. Usually costing $8 per month, the VR games that you get from the service will remain playable as long as your subscription is active.  Make the jump into virtual reality with the Meta Quest 3. The headset features a very simple design, but it offers realistic graphics, quick load times, and seamless gameplay through the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset. Instead of eye tracking, it uses an extensive camera-tracking setup that enables advanced mixed reality. It runs for up to 2.2 hours on a single charge with average, and once the Meta Quest 3’s battery goes empty, it only take 2 hours of charging with its 18W power adapter to get to full charge. The new Touch Plus controllers of the Meta Quest 3 utilize AI algorithms and an IR sensor, and they’re powered by AA batteries. In our Meta Quest 3 versus Meta Quest 2 comparison, the only negative about the latest model of the VR headset is its higher price. However, it does everything better than its predecessor, including improved image clarity through the use of pancake lenses, color passthrough for better mixed reality, 30% more resolution at 2064 x 2208 pixels per eye, a GPU that’s twice as fast, and 40% louder sound. Apple has long been known to turn out some of the best laptops, with models like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro regularly being among the most sought-after laptops. It can actually be difficult to land some decent Apple deals, as the brand's popularity keeps many of its products from seeing the bargain bin. Right now, however, Apple has a lot of options among the best laptop deals. The original Apple Silicon MacBook Air is seeing some of its lowest prices ever, and there’s even some newer MacBook Pros discounted right now. Whether you’re in search of a MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro, reading onward you’ll find the best MacBook deals currently available.

European digital rights group say the future of online privacy is on a knife edge,2024-02-16T07:00:31+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/no-consent-or-pay-pls/,"A coalition of more than two dozen digital and democratic rights groups, NGOs and not-for-profits, including noyb and Wikimedia Europe, have written to the European Union’s regulatory body for data protection urging it to reject a tactic that’s been controversially seized upon by Meta in its latest bid to circumvent the bloc’s privacy laws.  If the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) fails to move against so-called “consent or pay” approaches to processing citizens’ personal data it will create a fatal loophole in the bloc’s flagship data protection regime that could gut people’s privacy rights and reshape the web for the worse, the organizations warn. (See the base of this post for a full list of the signatories to the letter.) Last year in the EU Meta switched to claiming it would gather regional users’ consent to track and profile them to run its microtargeting ads business — following successful challenges, under the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), against the legal bases it had previously claimed for the same purpose (first performance of a contract; then legitimate interest). But Meta’s version of consent offers users a Hobson’s choice — of paying at least €9.99/month for an ad-free subscription (per each account they have on Facebook and Instagram); or agreeing to its tracking.  No other choices are available, despite the GDPR stipulating that for consent to be a valid legal basis for processing people’s information it must be freely given. (Meta seems to be playing on ‘free’ in a monetary sense here; but the law actually requires that users feel free to consent or not consent… which is basically the opposite of the costly scenario the adtech giant has concocted that puts a literal premium on privacy.) The NGOs are dubbing this tactic “pay or okay”. And the concerns they’re raising with the EDPB have been aired by noyb for several years, including — most recently — in two GDPR complaints filed with data protection authorities (DPAs) last year which are challenging Meta’s approach as unlawful. The privacy rights group has actually been fighting consent or pay (or pay or okay) for years — bringing a raft of earlier challenges against a number of European news publishers which devised the tactic to extract consent from their own users by putting their journalism behind a cookie paywall that demands readers accept tracking or cough up for a subscription. And, in some cases, news publishers have gained, if not full-throated approval from their local data protection authorities, then the equivalent of a wink and a nod and been allowed to carry on. So more of these cookie paywalls have been popping up on news sites around the region.  However Meta is not in the journalism business. Indeed, it typically denies it’s a publisher — saying it’s just an intermediary (platform) connecting users. Yet it’s now appropriating the same tactic as the publishers. (And, indeed, it may not be the only adtech giant to sniff the chance of a pri...",-2

Meta’s A.I. Chief Yann LeCun Explains Why a House Cat Is Smarter Than The Best A.I.,2024-02-15T20:24:57+00:00,https://observer.com/2024/02/metas-a-i-chief-yann-lecun-explains-why-a-house-cat-is-smarter-than-the-best-a-i/,"Yann LeCun, Meta (META)’s chief A.I. scientist and known in his field as one of the “godfathers” of deep learning, believes the widespread fear that powerful A.I. models are dangerous is largely imaginary, because current A.I. technology is nowhere near human-level intelligence—not even cat-level intelligence. And while he is certain that A.I. will reach the so called artificial general intelligence (AGI) stage eventually, that timeline may be a lot longer than most researchers think.

There were stories about the fact that you could use an LLM (large language model) to give you instructions of how to make chemical weapon or bioweapon. That turns out to be false,” LeCun said during an onstage interview at the World Government Summit in Dubai this week. “Those systems are trained on public data. They can’t really invent anything, at least today,” he went on to explain. “Some time in the future those systems might be actually smart enough to give you useful information better than you can get with a search engine. But it’s just not true today.” The French scientist, who won the 2018 Turing Award along with Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio for his contribution to artificial neural networks research, has famously said that even the most advanced A.I. systems today have less common sense than a house cat. “The brain of a house cat has about 800 million neurons. You have to multiply that by 2,000 to get to the number of synapses, or the connections between neurons, which is the equivalent of the number of parameters in an LLM,” LeCun said, noting that the largest LLMs have about the same number of parameters as the number of synapses in a cat’s brain. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model, which powers the free version of ChatGPT, has 175 billion parameters.

OpenAI’s newest model can generate videos — and they look decent,2024-02-15T19:35:43+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/openais-newest-model-can-generate-videos-and-they-look-decent/,"OpenAI, following in the footsteps of startups like Runway and tech giants like Google and Meta, is getting into video generation. OpenAI today unveiled Sora, a generative AI model that creates video from text. Given a brief — or detailed — description or a still image, Sora can generate 1080p movie-like scenes with multiple characters, different types of motion and background details, OpenAI claims. Sora can also “extend” existing video clips — doing its best to fill in the missing details. “Sora has a deep understanding of language, enabling it to accurately interpret prompts and generate compelling characters that express vibrant emotions,” OpenAI writes in a blog post. “The model understands not only what the user has asked for in the prompt, but also how those things exist in the physical world.” Now, there’s a lot of bombast in OpenAI’s demo page for Sora — the above statement being an example. But the cherry-picked samples from the model do look rather impressive, at least compared to the other text-to-video technologies we’ve seen. For starters, Sora can generate videos in a range of styles (e.g., photorealistic, animated, black and white) up to a minute long — far longer than most text-to-video models. And these videos maintain reasonable coherence in the sense that they don’t always succumb to what I like to call “AI weirdness,” like objects moving in physically impossible directions. Check out this tour of an art gallery, all generated by Sora (ignore the graininess — compression from my video-GIF conversion tool): Image Credits: OpenAI Image Credits: OpenAI Or this animation of a flower blooming: Image Credits: OpenAI Image Credits: OpenAI I will say that some of Sora’s videos with a humanoid subject — a robot standing against a cityscape, for example, or a person walking down a snowy path — have a video game-y quality to them, perhaps because there’s not a lot going on in the background. AI weirdness manages to creep into many clips besides, like cars driving in one direction, then suddenly reversing or arms melting into a duvet cover. Image Credits: OpenAI Image Credits: OpenAI OpenAI — for all its superlatives — acknowledges the model isn’t perfect. It writes: “[Sora] may struggle with accurately simulating the physics of a complex scene, and may not understand specific instances of cause and effect. For example, a person might take a bite out of a cookie, but afterward, the cookie may not have a bite mark. The model may also confuse spatial details of a prompt, for example, mixing up left and right, and may struggle with precise descriptions of events that take place over time, like following a specific camera trajectory.” OpenAI’s very much positioning Sora as a research preview, revealing little about what data was used to train the model (short of ~10,000 hours of “high-quality” video) and refraining from making Sora generally available. Its rationale is the potential for abuse; OpenAI correctly points out that bad actors could...",-2

"$3,000+ for a VR headset? No chance, grab the Meta Quest 2 for less than $250 at Walmart right now",2024-02-15T17:02:53+00:00,https://www.livescience.com/technology/dollar3000-for-a-vr-headset-no-chance-grab-the-meta-quest-2-for-less-than-dollar250-at-walmart-right-now,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Save over $50 on Meta's last-generation headset and jump into VR. You don't often see deals on the Meta Quest 2, but in Walmart's latest round of savings the retailer is trimming $52.03 off the price of the VR headset. Although there are newer headsets out there  — the Meta Quest 3 was released in 2023, while the eyewateringly-expensive Apple Vision Pro came out in January — the Meta Quest 2 remains an excellent way to jump into VR on a budget. And that budget is even more appealing now, thanks to the weirdly specific saving of $52.03 off the MSRP at Walmart (those extra 3 cents make all the difference), bringing the Meta Quest 2 under $250. Meta Quest 2: <a href=""https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/565706/9383?subId1=hawk-custom-tracking&sharedId=hawk&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMeta-Quest-2-All-in-One-Wireless-VR-Headset-128GB%2F723227733%3Fathbdg%3DL1600"" data-link-merchant=""walmart.com"""" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">Was $299.99, now $247.96 on Walmart
The Meta Quest 2 has more than $50 off, and comes with two controllers in the box. While the Meta Quest 3 improves the resolution of the lenses, the Meta Quest 2 (formerly known as the Oculus Quest 2) is still a visual treat for the eyes. Considering how many apps and games are available on the Meta Store, you'll appreciate the 128GB storage, and the Quest 2 has a surprising bonus if you have a PC, too. You can hook it up to your computer to run Steam VR games like Half-Life: Alyx, which would otherwise be too much for the headset's built-in GPU to handle. In our Meta Quest 2 review, we awarded it a four-and-a-half-star rating and said: ""Meta Quest 2 is a full VR ecosystem in a box for $399/£399 [price at time of publication], making it an attractive proposition for VR newcomers while still offering desirable features for experienced users.""

Meta says it will pass on the Apple tax to advertisers paying to boost posts on Facebook and Instagram,2024-02-15T16:49:35+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/15/meta-says-it-will-pass-on-the-apple-tax-to-advertisers-paying-to-boost-posts-on-facebook-and-instagram/,"Meta is looking to leverage advertiser outrage in its battle with Apple over in-app purchase fees by announcing that it will soon pass on Apple’s 30% service charge to its customers. In an announcement, the social networking giant explains that starting later this month, advertisers who want to pay to boost a post in the Facebook or Instagram iOS app will now be billed through Apple, where this additional charge will now be levied. Meta had apparently been skirting Apple’s rules with the pay-to-boost option, as the company notes it’s now required to “either comply with Apple’s guidelines, or remove boosted posts from our apps.” As it obviously doesn’t want to do the latter, it’s simply upping the cost of those in-app purchases so the impact on its own bottom line won’t suffer. Advertisers can avoid the upcharge by paying to boost posts from the web on either Facebook.com or Instagram.com, which works in both desktop and mobile browsers. But Meta understands that customers won’t see this as a convenience — in-app purchases are the easiest way to transact on Apple’s devices. So for those who choose to use in-app purchases, they’ll now have to pay more for the privilege. The company likely hopes that raising the price for boosts on iOS will help generate outrage that will aid it in its broader efforts to disrupt Apple’s stranglehold over the iOS app economy. Meta, like other tech giants, including Epic Games, Spotify, Match and others, wants to offer its own payment systems in its apps, and not be required to use Apple’s in-app purchases, which results in a 30% commission on its in-app sales. The company is among those pushing lawmakers and regulators to change how Apple does business. By passing on Apple’s 30% charge to the thousands of small business advertisers on iOS, it may have a few more allies in its war with Apple. In addition, the shift to Apple’s in-app purchases will mean that advertisers have to pay upfront, instead of after their boosted posts run, as before. This will require them to add prepaid funds to their accounts to draw from for a boost, Meta explains, which incurs the 30% fee. Adding funds to their account from the web, however, will not include the fee. The changes will initially apply to Meta’s apps in the U.S. but will roll out to other markets later this year. Meta and Apple have been increasingly at odds as Apple expanded its advertising business, cutting into Meta’s revenue. With the launch of App Tracking Transparency, which allows consumers to opt out of having apps track them, Meta lost advertising market share as Apple’s grew. The company also long argued that Apple’s ATT would cut into its ad revenues, warning investors that “headwinds” from ATT would impact its own ability to monetize through advertising. Meta has since recovered from the fallout from ATT, having just tripled its profit in Q4, and announced its first-ever dividend. The social networking giant was also among those that criticized Apple for its compl...",-1
New York City is suing TikTok and Instagram for ‘addicting’ children,2024-02-15T16:21:32+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073777/new-york-city-suing-tiktok-meta-google-snap-kids-mental-health,"By  Lauren Feiner, the senior policy reporter at The Verge, covering the intersection of Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill. She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform. New York City is the latest government to go after big tech companies for allegedly addicting kids to their platforms.  Several city agencies, including NYC’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and Department of Education, filed suit against Meta, TikTok, Snap, and Google, accusing them of “fueling the nationwide youth mental health crisis.” The city charged them with public nuisance and negligence. The city claims that the platforms’ design features, including recommendation algorithms and likes, addict children to the services and manipulate them into spending more and more time online.  The lawsuit adds to a growing wave of litigation from state and local governments that target tech platforms for allegedly addictive features that deceive and harm kids. The same set of social media companies faced a lawsuit from a Maryland school district last June that also accused them of contributing to a “mental health crisis.” Dozens of state governments sued Meta last fall for allegedly misleading the public about the harms its services could cause young users.  A ruling by a federal judge late last year indicates these kinds of lawsuits may survive early challenges. The California district court judge said that claims dealing with the “defects” of the platforms, rather than speech, could move forward and would not be considered in conflict with tech’s legal liability shield known as Section 230. However, none of the lawsuits mentioned above have had their core arguments tested in court. Protecting children from online harms has been one of the few internet policy issues that has seemed to maintain momentum across many levels of government, even as legislation is increasingly difficult to pass in Congress. A Senate hearing last month that featured several tech CEOs saw lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressing similar anger toward the companies’ handling of child safety. NYC Mayor Eric Adams has alluded to his skepticism of social media platforms in the past, including recently in his State of the City speech in January. In that speech, he spoke about his health commissioner’s advisory that categorized social media as a public health hazard. “Just as the surgeon general did with tobacco and guns, we are treating social media like other public health hazards and ensuring that tech companies take responsibility for their products,” the mayor said at the time, according to his prepared remarks. Alongside the lawsuit on Wednesday, Adams released a “social media action plan,” which includes holding tech platforms accountable for harms to children’s mental health, educating families on safer use, and researching social media’s impact on youth. The tech platforms named in the suit said they already take steps to ensure ...",-3

We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Legal weed shop owners in New York are pushing for investigation into social media companies and tech giants they say are allowing promotion of their unlicensed competition. It’s high time that Gov. Kathy Hochul step in — and even consider suing — Google, Meta and others for engaging in “false advertising” of unlicensed marijuana shops, some owners of legal dispensaries told The Post. “It would be disingenuous for them to say they don’t know what’s going on,” said Osbert Orduna, representing the Service Disabled Veterans in Cannabis Association. “They track every click that goes on their site.” Jayson Tantalo, co-founder and vice president of operations at the New York Cannabis Retail Association, said he and Orduna are gathering signatures for a letter to formally ask Hochul intervene, in her role overseeing the state Office of Cannabis Management. “If they are not licensed to sell cannabis, they should not have the right to advertise or market their services on Tik Tok, Yahoo and Google,” Tantalo said. The draft letter accuses the companies of being “complicit” and said they may be be in violation of state law. “These companies must be held accountable for their part in enabling illicit cannabis activity and failing to uphold the standards necessary to protect New York consumers and uphold the law,” the letter said. There are currently 75 licensed cannabis outlets in all of New York state, while Mayor Eric Adams and Sheriff Anthony Miranda estimate there are as many as 2,000 smoke shops illegally selling weed in New York City alone. Many illicit pot shops have operated with virtual impunity.  Few have been padlocked and of the $25 million in fines levied by state regulators against unlicensed stores, only a paltry $22,500 has been collected amid bureaucratic inertia and a lengthy appeals process — though Hochul has proposed new legislation that would make it easier to close illegal shops. A simple search on Google or Google Maps on “cannabis dispensaries near me” will show many unlicensed pot shops peddling their products with listed reviews — with little to distinguish illegal stores from licensed businesses. The sites give specific addresses, phone numbers and some include links to websites. Yelp also lists reviews for unlicensed stores while sites like Meta’s Instagram allow illegal shops to promote their products, licensed owners said. In the letter, the licensed operators note they are tightly regulated by the state with all cannabis products tested to rigorous standards to protect public health and safety. “The unchecked presence of unlicensed cannabis stores on popular social media platforms not only undermines the integrity of the regulated market but also poses serious risks to public health and safety …. potentially exposing consumers to untested and unsafe products, while depriving the state of much-needed tax reven...",-2

OpenAI unveils AI that instantly generates eye-popping videos,2024-02-24T13:00:16+00:00,https://www.denverpost.com/2024/02/24/openai-videos-artificial-intelligence/,"Digital Replica Edition Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts  Sign up for Newsletters and Alerts Digital Replica Edition 
			Trending:		 SAN FRANCISCO — In April, a New York startup called Runway AI unveiled technology that let people generate videos, like a cow at a birthday party or a dog chatting on a smartphone, simply by typing a sentence into a box on a computer screen. The four-second videos were blurry, choppy, distorted and disturbing. But they were a clear sign that artificial intelligence technologies would generate increasingly convincing videos in the months and years to come. Just 10 months later, the San Francisco startup OpenAI has unveiled a similar system that creates videos that look as if they were lifted from a Hollywood movie. A demonstration included short videos — created in minutes — of woolly mammoths trotting through a snowy meadow, a monster gazing at a melting candle and a Tokyo street scene seemingly shot by a camera swooping across the city. OpenAI, the company behind the ChatGPT chatbot and the still-image generator DALL-E, is among the many companies racing to improve this kind of instant video generator, including startups like Runway and tech giants like Google and Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram. The technology could speed the work of seasoned moviemakers, while replacing less experienced digital artists entirely. It could also become a quick and inexpensive way of creating online disinformation, making it even harder to tell what’s real on the internet. “I am absolutely terrified that this kind of thing will sway a narrowly contested election,” said Oren Etzioni, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in AI. He is also the founder of True Media, a nonprofit working to identify disinformation online in political campaigns. OpenAI calls its new system Sora, after the Japanese word for sky. The team behind the technology, including researchers Tim Brooks and Bill Peebles, chose the name because it “evokes the idea of limitless creative potential.” In an interview, they also said the company was not yet releasing Sora to the public because it was still working to understand the system’s dangers. Instead, OpenAI is sharing the technology with a small group of academics and other outside researchers who will “red team” it, a term for looking for ways it can be misused. “The intention here is to give a preview of what is on the horizon, so that people can see the capabilities of this technology — and we can get feedback,” Brooks said. OpenAI is already tagging videos produced by the system with watermarks that identify them as being generated by AI. But the company acknowledges that these can be removed. They can also be difficult to spot. (The New York Times added “Generated by AI” watermarks to the videos with this story.) The system is an example of generative AI, which can instantly create text, images and sounds. Like other generative AI technologies, OpenAI’s system learns by analyz...",-2

Meta’s Zuckerberg Seeks Out Of Lawsuits Blaming Him For Instagram Addiction,2024-02-24T04:31:00+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/zuckerberg-wants-no-personal-legal-blame-for-instagram-facebook-addiction,"(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg is seeking to avoid being held personally liable in two dozen lawsuits accusing Meta Platforms Inc. and other social media companies of addicting children to their products. The Meta chief executive officer made his case at a hearing Friday in California federal court, but the judge didn’t immediately make a decision. A ruling in Zuckerberg’s favor would dismiss him as a personal defendant in the litigation with no impact on the allegations against Meta. Holding him personally responsible may be a challenge because of a corporate law tradition of shielding executives from liability, especially at larger companies where decision-making is often layered. A loss for the billionaire who launched Facebook with friends as a Harvard undergraduate two decades ago could encourage claims against other CEOs in mass personal injury litigation.  Zuckerberg faces allegations from young people and parents that he was repeatedly warned that Instagram and Facebook weren’t safe for children, but ignored the findings and chose not to share them publicly.  The cases naming Zuckerberg are a small subset of a collection of more than 1,000 suits in state and federal courts by families and public school districts against Meta along with Alphabet Inc.’s Google, ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok and Snap Inc. US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, who is overseeing the federal cases, recently allowed some claims to proceed against the companies while dismissing others. Plaintiffs contend that as the face of Meta, Zuckerberg has a responsibility to “speak fully and truthfully on the risks Meta’s platforms pose to children’s health.” “With great power comes great responsibility,” plaintiffs’ lawyers said in a court filing, quoting the Spider Man comics in a footnote. “Unfortunately, Mr. Zuckerberg has not lived up to that maxim.” Zuckerberg, the world’s fourth-richest person, has argued that he can’t be held personally responsible for actions at Meta just because he’s the CEO. His lawyers also claim that Zuckerberg didn’t have a duty to disclose the safety findings that were allegedly reported to him. “There is ample legal precedent establishing that being an executive does not confer liability for alleged conduct of a corporation,” a Meta spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the claims against Zuckerberg should be dismissed in their entirety. At the hearing, Rogers pressed the plaintiffs about whether Zuckerberg was required to disclose safety information absent a “special relationship” with the users of his products. Plaintiffs had argued that the Meta CEO had a responsibility to Facebook and Instagram users given his “outsize role in the company,” but Rogers challenged them to point to a specific law that would support their argument. Rogers appeared more sympathetic to plaintiffs’ arguments that Zuckerberg could be held liable for personally concealing information as a corporate officer at Meta, asking Zuckerberg’s lawyers how...",-2

Meta allowed parents to exploit their kids by having pedophiles pay to see them in bikinis on Instagram: report,2024-02-23T16:45:11+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/23/business/meta-allowed-parents-to-exploit-kids-by-having-pedophiles-pay-to-see-bikinis-on-instagram-report/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Meta’s new paid subscription service allowed parents to exploit their children by charging pedophiles to gawk at their bikini-clad kids on Instagram, where girls as young as nine years old were attracting comments from men such as “perfect bikini body,” “those thighs are perfection” and “you’re so hot.” Staffers at Facebook and Instagram parent Meta said that they flagged hundreds of so-called “parent-managed minor accounts” that were using the subscription feature on those platforms to sell exclusive content that included photos of young girls in bikinis and leotards to mostly men, according to the Wall Street Journal. To make matters worse, Meta’s algorithm-run recommendation systems were reportedly promoting child-modeling accounts to adults who posted pedophilic comments. When Meta staffers tried to get the company to ban these accounts or at least force them to register with content moderators so that they could be monitored, their bosses declined — instead choosing to rely on a less-reliable automated system that allowed pedophiles to evade guardrails, sources told Journal. The report comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who personally apologized to parents who confronted him about their children being exploited through his platforms last month, is seeking to avoid personal liability in two dozen lawsuits accusing his company of getting kids hooked on his social media sites. Last year, Meta introduced a paid-subscription service to entice influencers to produce more content on their flagship social media platforms. Subscribers to these accounts who agreed to pay $19.99 a month were offered perks such as “in-person events” as well as “early access or releases,” according to The Journal report. The Journal found several instances in which banned accounts engaged in child exploitation were resurfacing — generating as many as hundreds of thousands of followers. One Facebook page with more than 200,000 followers featured pinup-style photos of children. The Meta staffers realized that the parents were well aware of highly explicit comments from adults toward their children — even going so far as to engage in sexual banter about their kids with subscribers. The company’s policy required that adults be the only ones eligible to sell content or solicit donations, though it did create a carve-out for kids to have their names on an account so long as it was co-managed by an adult. This led to the creation of child-model accounts which attracted the interest of strange men — prompting one Canadian activist, Sarah Adams, to warn of Instagram pages that included photos of prepubescent girls in bikinis that were being purchased by pedophiles. “We launched creator monetization tools with a robust set of safety measures and multiple checks on both creators and their content,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told The Journal. He said Meta’s effo...",-3
Mark Zuckerberg looks to skirt liability in two dozen lawsuits blaming him for Instagram addiction,2024-02-23T15:41:51+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/23/business/mark-zuckerberg-looks-to-skirt-blame-in-lawsuits-about-instagram-addiction/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Mark Zuckerberg will attempt to wriggle out of being held personally liable in two dozen lawsuits accusing Meta of addicting children to the company’s social media networks during a hearing in a California court Friday. Lawyers for Zuckerberg, the world’s fourth richest person, are expected to make the case to dismiss any litigation against him, which would not impact the allegations against Meta, Bloomberg reported. Zuckerberg did not attend the hearing. The Facebook and Instagram parent company has come under fire for not doing enough to protect children from scams like “sextortion,” where criminals trick kids into sending sexually explicit photos or videos and then threaten to release them unless they pay. Zuckerberg has publicly maintained that his platforms are safe — despite multiple lawsuits that Meta has put profits before safety when it comes to the mental health of children. Should US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers decide to hold Zuckerberg personally liable in the lawsuits, the decision could serve as a model for other social media users looking to hold tech behemoth CEOs responsible in mass personal injury litigation. However, overcoming corporate laws that traditionally shield executives from liability could prove tricky because decision-making at large companies like Meta is typically layered, legal experts said. A Meta spokesperson told The Post that there’s ample precedent establishing that being an executive does not confer liability for alleged conduct of a corporation. The spokesperson added that the claims also don’t say Zuckerberg violated a legal duty, and should be dismissed, in their entirety. Judge Gonzalez Rogers has asked counsel on both sides to clarify how laws covering negligent misrepresentation and corporate officer responsibility vary among individual states. Before making a ruling, the judge will certainly also weigh Zuckerberg’s involvement in day-to-day decisions at Meta, including his knowledge of the practices in question. Plaintiffs’ lawyers — who have declared that as the boss of Meta, Zuckerberg has a responsibility to “speak fully and truthfully on the risks Meta’s platforms pose to children’s health” — will have to prove that Zuckerberg has control over decision-making to score a victory, according to Bloomberg. “With great power comes great responsibility,” plaintiffs’ lawyers added in a court filing, a nod to the Spider-Man comics. “Unfortunately, Mr. Zuckerberg has not lived up to that maxim.” Representatives for Meta did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. Meta was a swath of lawsuits, including one filed by New Mexico Attorney General Raul Torrez claims that Instagram was “not only aware that users under 13 were lying about their age to gain access to the platform, but that executives believed the answer to this solution was to ‘upsell’ the service as opposed to instituting stricter registration procedures.” ...",-3

Tech layoffs in 2024: A timeline,2024-02-23T10:41:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685936/tech-layoffs-in-2023-a-timeline.html#tk.rss_all," After two years of massive layoffs at IT companies, 2024 was expected to be a year of recovery for the IT industry. While there are early signs of that, with global IT spending expected to increase 8% to cross $5.1 trillion in 2024 according to Gartner, jobs continue to be impacted in the sector. Some of the layoffs being seen this year are an extension of job cuts announced in 2023. Last year, tech giants including Amazon, Cisco, Facebook parent company Meta, Microsoft, Google, IBM, SAP, and Salesforce—as well as many smaller companies —announced sweeping job cuts. The problem: Big Tech went on a hiring binge during the pandemic when lockdowns sparked a tech buying spree to support remote work and an uptick in e-commerce, and now they face revenue declines. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,186 tech companies laid off about 262,682 staff in 2023, compared to 164,969 layoffs in 2022. In 2024, 168 tech companies have already laid off 42,324 employees. Here is a list—to be updated regularly—of some of the most prominent technology layoffs the industry has experienced recently. April 1: Dell acknowledges 13,000 job cuts Dell Technologies’ latest 10K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the company had laid off 13,000 employees over the course of the 2023 fiscal year; it characterized the layoffs and other reorganizational moves as cost-cutting measures. “These actions resulted in a reduction in our overall headcount,” the company said. A comparison to the previous year’s 10K filing, performed by The Register, found that Dell employed 133,000 people at that point, compared to 120,000 as of February 2024. Dell announced layoffs of 6,650 staffers on Feb. 6, but it is unclear whether those cuts were reflected in the numbers from this year’s 10K statement. Feb. 14: Cisco cuts 5% of workforce Cisco will shed 4,200 of its 84,900 employees as it refocuses on more profitable areas of its business, including AI and security. The company’s last major round of layoffs was in November 2022. Cisco’s sales of telecommunications equipment have been hit by delays at telcos in rolling out equipment they havealready purchased. AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billions—and that’s before it announced its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications.  Feb. 6 DocuSign will lay off 6% of workforce in restructuring Digital workflow company DocuSign will lay off 440 of its 7,336 staff as it seeks to cut costs. The lay-offs come amid reports that attempts to sell the company to investment firms have fallen apart after a failure to agree on price. Jan. 25: Microsoft axes 1,900 workers in its gaming division Roughly 8% of Microsoft’s Gaming division is headed for unemployment, the company announced Thursday, with the lion’s share of job cuts affecting the newly acquir...",2

Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that both features are available to only a small number of people. Users who have access to the draft can save only one post (bummer). You can write the post you might want to post later in the composer, and just swipe down to save the draft. The Threads app also shows a different composer icon in the bottom bar when there is a saved draft that you haven’t posted yet. The composer icon in the Threads app will now indicate if there is a saved draft. Image Credits: Threads The composer icon in the Threads app will now indicate if there is a saved draft.

Nvidia Tops Meta Record With $277 Billion Surge in Value,2024-02-23T00:48:45+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/nvidia-to-top-meta-record-with-nearly-250-billion-value-jump,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s surge to an all-time high is the biggest single-session increase in market value in history, besting Meta Platforms Inc.’s historic gain just three weeks ago. Shares of the chipmaker jumped 16% Thursday, adding about $277 billion in market capitalization and bringing its total market value near $2 trillion. The addition eclipsed the $197 billion gain made by Facebook-parent Meta at the start of the month.  “The company is printing money at this point,” Stacy Rasgon an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein said. “And the prospect for continued growth from here still seems solid.” Nvidia shares surged after it reported blowout results that cemented Wall Street bets on the potential for its artificial intelligence technologies. The chipmaker also gave guidance above expectations, driven by AI spending at its biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp. and Meta. A series of estimate-beating results means the shares have been getting cheaper on a price-to-earnings basis. Read: What Bubble? Nvidia Profits Are Rising Even More Than Its Stock Nvidia surpassed high expectations, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore. “We had never seen $2 billion+ of upside to quarterly revenue guidance until Nvidia did it a few quarters ago, but it has become routine during the AI surge,” he wrote. “Strength of AI demand continues to be remarkable.” --With assistance from Siddhartha Mahanta and Carmen Reinicke.

MARKET REPORT: Nvidia adds £206bn in biggest ever share rally,2024-02-22T22:00:58+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-13115045/MARKET-REPORT-Nvidia-adds-206bn-biggest-share-rally.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By John Abiona    Updated:  22:00, 22 February 2024      5 View  comments  Chipmaker Nvidia has jumped in value by £214billion, delivering the biggest increase in market value of any company in a single day’s trading in history. Shares surged 16 per cent yesterday in New York. The increase outpaces the £156billion gain made by Facebook owner Meta at the start of February. It comes after Nvidia on Wednesday night posted strong results and an upbeat forecast, pouring more fuel on the artificial intelligence-led rally in tech shares. Revenue more than doubled to over $60billion (£47.5billion) in its latest financial year, while profit soared to nearly $3billion (£2.4billion). Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said: ‘Accelerated computing and generative artificial intelligence have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide.’ In demand: Nvidia shares rose nearly 15% yesterday in New York. The increase outpaces the £156bn gain made by Facebook owner Meta at the start of February The group is one of Wall Street’s most valuable companies as the AI craze lifted US stock markets to record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.18 per cent, while the S&P 500 increased 2.11 per cent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 2.96 per cent. In London, the FTSE 100 rose 0.3 per cent, or 21.98 points, to 7684.49 and the FTSE 250 was up 0.8 per cent, or 144.53 points, to 19,263.50. Anglo American became the latest miner to slash its dividend after its payout for 2023 dropped to £940million, from the £1.9billion it paid the year before. Glencore and Rio Tinto earlier this week also handed out less to shareholders. It comes as weaker metals and diamond prices caused profits for Anglo American to fall 94 per cent to £223million.  The FTSE 100 miner had a torrid year as the markets for diamonds and platinum group metals collapsed and it slashed its copper production outlook. It has written down £2billion in its diamond and nickel businesses and booked a £1.3billion impairment charge on its De Beers diamond division as well as a writedown of £700million for a nickel mine in Brazil after the metal’s price tumbled from record highs in 2022.   Investors in Marlowe look set for a bumper payout after a £430million deal with European private equity firm Inflexion. The group, which helps firms comply with regulations in areas such as employment, and health and safety is selling some software assets. It will use the money to clear its debt and return more than £150million to shareholders. A restructure will also see Marlowe chief executive Alex Dacre, who founded it in 2015, depart.

DailyMail.com puts both to the test",2024-02-22T21:24:01+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-13110105/daily-mail-review-apple-vision-pro-meta-quest-headset.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ito=1490&ns_campaign=1490,"By Matthew Phelan Senior Science Reporter For Dailymail.Com   Published:  19:24, 22 February 2024   |  Updated:  21:24, 22 February 2024      29 View  comments  Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made waves last week when he posted his scathing review of Apple's Vision Pro, the rival to his company's mixed reality headset, the Meta Quest 3. Zuckerberg called the Quest a 'better product, period' in his Instagram story discussing Apple's $3,500 virtual reality headset, despite admitting he expected it to have a higher quality feel than his $500 Quest. But when DailyMail.com's own staff compared and contrasted the two headsets for ourselves, the results were decidedly split.  Though Zuckerberg was correct to point out the lighter weight and comfort of the Quest, its more affordable price point, and its 'immersive content library,' the Vision Pro comes with some truly impressive hardware specs and media partnerships. Many won't want to splurge on a toy-like goggled gadget at all — but if you're debating between the Vision Pro and the Quest 3 it might just come down to what you actually plan to use it for. Here are some of the unavoidable hard truths: First, the Apple Vision Pro does weigh more, 650 grams (1.4 lb), head strap included, compared to the 515-gram (1.1 lb) weight of the Meta Quest 3 and its head strap. The difference may not seem like a lot on paper, but it's likely to discomfort plenty of users after a few hours of continued use. Quest 3 (right) is 40 percent thinner and more comfortable than its predecessors - the Quest 2 (left) And that's not counting the Vision Pro's heavy external battery pack, which adds another 353 grams (0.8 lb) and a cumbersome, dangling wire that's sure to get in the way as you attempt to take in all of Apple's new 360-degree virtual environments. When I took the Vision Pro for my trial run at an Apple store, the Apple 'genius' guiding me would not let me stand up, which limited my ability to test just how much the wire and weight issues might annoy me.  But DailyMail.com social video producer Frank Muniz tried the device while standing and his verdict confirmed my suspicions: 'This is starting to get uncomfortable.' My sense is that many who will use the Vision Pro to watch 3D movies, do 3D design work, or other semi-sedentary tasks, won't be bothered by the wires at all.   But for many popular 'mixed reality' use-cases, like fitness apps and rhythm-based video games, these hardware choices are going to frustrating. While Meta's CEO is practically required to speak better of Quest, it's his fiduciary duty to Meta's shareholders, Zuckerberg was still right about Quest's advantages. 'We designed it to be 120 grams lighter, which makes a really big difference on your face,' Zuckerberg said. 'There's no wires that get in the way when you move around. Our field of view is wider and I found our screen to be brighter also.' So, on the mobility issues at least, there's no contest. Winner: Meta Quest 3 Many won't want to splurge ...",3

"Sony’s PS VR2 is getting compatibility, possibly by end of year",2024-02-22T19:23:58+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/22/sonys-ps-vr2-is-getting-compatibility-possibly-by-end-of-year/,"PlayStation VR often gets overlooked in conversations about mixed reality. These days, it seems all anyone wants to talk about is Apple Vision Pro versus Meta Quest. But Sony has been an enduring presence in VR for years now, throughout the industry’s various ups and downs (mostly downs, if we’re being honest here). The Japanese electronics giant this week confirmed plans to give the PS VR2 a new lease on life, as it has begun testing PC compatibility. The news was buried a few paragraphs deep in a PlayStation.Blog post highlighting a number of new titles for the platform. Here’s the entirety of what Sony Interactive Content Communications Manager Gillen McAllister wrote on the topic this morning: “Also, we’re pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5. We hope to make this support available in 2024, so stay tuned for more updates.” Phrases like “we hope to make” don’t instill a lot of confidence around when — or if — the cross-platform compatibility will arrive. Given that we’re only just entering late-February, we’re talking about a big window, assuming Sony does hit the 2024 deadline. That the feature was tossed off in a post of new titles is telling in itself. Content has always been an issue for mixed reality, but opening up the headset to Windows titles would suddenly bring in a flood of new experiences overnight. PlayStation exclusivity is likely a big part of the reason PS VR often doesn’t feel like a part of the broader mixed reality conversation. So, too, is the fact that the peripheral is focused pretty exclusively on gaming, whereas Apple, Meta and — to an extent — HTC are looking to encompass something broader that also includes spatial computing/productivity, enterprise applications and other entertainment avenues. Gaming is, of course, a big, broad category unto itself. The space has been the key driver of VR technologies for decades now, and there’s plenty of growth to navigate and grow in that line. Opening up to PC titles will certainly help PS VR on both of those fronts.",-1

"Spotify follows Meta, YouTube and others by offering AUX, a service to connect brands and creators",2024-02-22T15:46:44+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/22/spotify-follows-meta-youtube-and-others-by-offering-aux-a-service-to-connect-brands-and-creators/,"Facebook, Instagram, Snap, YouTube and other social networking companies offer programs to connect creators with brands, and now Spotify is doing the same. The company announced the launch of AUX, its new in-house “music advisory agency” for brands. While not necessarily a creator marketplace, the program has a similar aim — it will facilitate connections between brands and emerging artists for various campaigns benefiting both parties. For Spotify, AUX represents another source of income, as well, as the company says brands can pay Spotify to leverage the new service. The consultancy’s first client is Coca-Cola, which sees the beverage giant teaming up with Berlin-based DJ, producer, singer and songwriter Peggy Gou. Together, the brand and artist have established a long-term partnership that will include live concerts, events, social media content, a branded playlist and on-platform promotional support. The move sees Spotify taking a more proactive stance in helping to facilitate connections and offering its music expertise to brand partners, but it also positions the platform as more akin to a social network, where creators strike brand deals to pay the bills. The launch, notably, follows that of Spotify’s updated payment model, which arrived late last year, promising to drive an additional $1 billion toward artists. But critics of the model said that it did little to support emerging artists, and in fact, would cut payments to artists who already receive less, to boost payments to those who received more. Now, Spotify is offering those artists cut out of the benefits of the new streaming royalties model a new way to make money by partnering with brands. “Spotify AUX will broaden the opportunities available to artists, offering them a platform for creative expression, financial support, and strategic partnerships that go beyond traditional industry avenues,” the company explained, in a blog post. “We are proud to be an early partner to AUX, which integrates Spotify’s expertise to enable authentic connections with music fans worldwide,” said Joshua Burke, global head of Music & Culture Marketing at The Coca-Cola Company, in a statement shared by Spotify. “This is a natural progression of our long-standing partnership with Spotify and marks a key milestone for our commitment to artists and the music community. We are excited to launch Coke Studio at Spotify LA, which will provide recording support for emerging artists and a platform to promote their music.” Though Spotify touts AUX as giving artists another opportunity to “live off their art,” artists and musicians would likely rather get paid better for their streams, rather than having to forge brand deals like social media creators and influencers do. However, the overabundance of music offered by today’s streaming services — where 120,000+ tracks are uploaded to services daily — means it’s harder for new and emerging artists to be discovered, build an audience and get paid. And while Spotify ...",1
"How to keep your teen safe on Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook",2024-02-22T15:46:40+00:00,https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/mother-and-baby/512027/how-to-keep-teens-safe-instagram-whatsapp-facebook/,"Subscribe Does your teenager use any of the Meta apps such as WhatsApp, Instagram or Facebook? While the apps offer great enjoyment and connectivity with friends, you may have concerns about your child viewing unsuitable content for their age, experiencing online bullying, or even worse, exposure to unwanted messages from strangers. Did you know that WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook are for teens aged 13+? HELLO! spoke to Tara Hopkins, Meta’s Global Director for Public Policy, for advice on keeping our kids safe on their platforms. For young people in particular, Instagram provides a great place for self-expression and connecting with friends. We always love hearing from teenagers who have used Instagram to explore different hobbies and interests or meet friends who are into the same things as them and connect with like-minded people.   Start talking early:  Using social media can be a really exciting time for young people, but we must make sure they feel they can talk to their parents about it, and feel empowered to use our platforms in a positive way.  It’s important to start having these conversations early - I really encourage parents to start having these conversations well before their child even has their first phone. I also try and put myself in their shoes. I remember the difficult conversations I had with my parents growing up so listening to them and what they want is really important. There's lots of advice out there from organisations like Parentzone to help you get started, I’ve used them myself to talk to my kids. Activate Parental Supervision Tools: We’ve added a host of tools to help parents understand and help their teenagers use our apps. We know that these can be particularly useful as a young person begins their journey on social media and also provides peace of mind for parents. Using them allows you as a parent to see more information about when your teen reports an account or post. These tools can also guide the use of our apps, including setting time limits, seeing who their teen follows and who follows them, and having access to their privacy settings.  Get help from experts: There's no right answer when it comes to parenting through the digital age, so we’ve worked with a host of experts and charities to help us with this. Check out our parents’ guide on our website which has a wealth of material on how to keep teens safe online. And ask your friends with older children. I find that parents are always happy to share their experiences.  Report it! And talk about it. We hope young people never come across harmful content in the first place, but if they do, it’s really important that they report this directly using our in-app reporting tools. It’s all anonymous, which means no information about the person who has reported the content will ever be shared with the person whose account, post, or comment has been reported. And let your teen know they can talk to you about it, or another trusted adult.  Cyberbullying is somethi...",1
WhatsApp Text Formatting Shortcuts: Four new text formats introduced - Check shortcuts to use them,2024-02-22T15:13:53+00:00,https://www.zeebiz.com/technology/news-whatsapp-text-formatting-shortcuts-text-tricks-style-template-code-how-to-use-bold-bullet-number-italic-chat-meta-mark-zuckerberg-277671,"WhatsApp Text Formatting Shortcuts, WhatsApp Text Tricks Styles: Popular instant messaging platform WhatsApp has introduced four new text formatting options. The Meta-owned platform said that these formats are in addition to already available formatting options. So far, WhatsApp users had the option of using  Bold, Italic, Strikethrough, and Monospace formatting. ""Adding four new text formatting options to help people organize and craft their messages on WhatsApp. These help save time and help people communicate more effectively via their messages, especially in group chats,"" Mark Zuckerberg, Founder and CEO at Meta, said. Bulleted Lists - To outline steps in a process, list ingredients in a recipe or call out the main points of a message. Numbered Lists - To note a specific order of things such as instructions or a recap of events.  Block Quote - To highlight key text and make it more noticeable in messages. Inline Code - To help distinguish specific information within a sentence.  Bulleted Lists - Type the '-' symbol, followed by a space. Numbered Lists - Type 1 or 2 digits followed by a period and one space.  Block Quote - Type the '>' symbol followed by a space. Inline Code - Users can wrap text with '`' symbol - for example, `message`.  These new formatting options on WhatsApp are available to all users on Android, iOS, Web, and Mac desktop platforms.  Earlier, WhatsApp let users create, edit and share their stickers on WhatsApp when using iOS, without having to leave the app.   One can create stickers without having to drag-and-drop from image gallery or use unofficial third-party apps, all while benefiting from the security of WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption.

Meta's Oversight Board extends its scope to Instagram Threads,2024-02-22T13:45:15+00:00,https://www.zeebiz.com/technology/news-metas-oversight-board-extends-its-scope-to-instagram-threads-277667,"Meta's Oversight Board on Thursday said it is expanding its scope to include Instagram app Threads which allows users to share text updates and join public conversations. This is the first time the Board's review has expanded its scope to cover a new app, after it reviewed and decided appeals from Facebook and Instagram users since October 2020. “People using Threads will be able to challenge Meta's decisions by appealing eligible content to the Oversight Board."" ""The appeals process for Threads is similar to the one for Facebook and Instagram,” the board said in a statement. Once users have exhausted Meta's internal appeals process, the company will issue an Oversight Board reference ID that allows users to submit their cases for review on the Oversight Board website. “In addition to the 130 million people using Threads, Meta will also be able to refer cases about content on Threads to the Board,” it added. Board members will examine Meta's content decisions based on Instagram's Community Guidelines (which apply to Threads), the company's values and its international human rights commitments, especially to the principles of freedom of expression. “Our decisions will be binding, and Meta must implement them within seven days."" ""We will also be able to make recommendations for how Meta can improve its approach to content moderation, which the company must respond to within 60 days,” said the Board. Threads is still evolving rapidly and while it stabilises, Meta will be able to implement policy and enforcement recommendations from decisions about Threads but will not be able to implement product-specific recommendations.

Meta’s Oversight Board extends its scope to Threads,2024-02-22T13:00:57+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/22/the-oversight-board-extends-its-scope-to-metas-threads-app/,"Meta’s external advisory group, its Oversight Board, announced today that it is expanding its scope to Threads along with Facebook and Instagram to scrutinize Meta’s content moderation decisions. This means if users on Threads are unsatisfied with Meta’s decision on issues like content or account takedown, they can appeal to the Oversight Board. “The Board’s expansion to Threads builds on our foundation of helping Meta solve the most difficult questions around content moderation. Having independent accountability early on for a new app such as Threads is vitally important,” Oversight Board co-chair Helle Thorning-Schmidt said in a statement. In 2018, Mark Zuckerberg formally talked about having an independent oversight board for the first time. In January 2020, Facebook proposed the board’s bylaws and announced the first set of members in May. In October 2020, the board said that it would start reviewing cases. In 2021, the observatory body expanded its scope to review Meta’s decision to keep certain content up. The Oversight Board has ruled on some important cases over the years. The most notable ruling was criticizing Facebook for “indefinitely” banning former President Donald Trump. While it agreed that Trump broke the platform’s rules, the board said that the guidelines don’t have specifications for an indefinite ban. Earlier this year, the board called on Meta to reform its “incoherent” rules about fake videos. Since Threads launched in July last year, users have questioned its moderation practices multiple times. In October, The Washington Post reported that the platform has been blocking terms like “Covid” and “vaccines” along with “gore,” “nude,” “sex” and “porn.” The same month, Instagram head Adam Mosseri mentioned that this ban was temporary. However, the company hasn’t lifted the ban as of today. Earlier this month, Threads said that it is running a fact-checking program, and users were seeing labels on some of the posts. However, the company clarified that it is because it matches existing fact checks on Meta’s other properties to posts on Threads. Last year, Meta said it intended to introduce a separate fact-check program for Threads, but the company hasn’t finalized what fact-checkers will be part of. Mosseri has been adamant about the decision to not recommend political content and “amplify news” on the platform. However, the social network’s newly rolled out trending topics function could feature political content as long as it doesn’t break company policy, Meta said last week. Oversight Board co-chair Catalina Botero Marino pointed out that with polls coming up in countries like the U.S. and India this year, advances in AI and conflicts across the world, content moderation has become harder. “With conflicts raging in Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere, billions of people heading to the polls in global elections and growing abuse towards marginalized groups online, there is no time to lose. Advances in artificial intelligence ...",2
"Meta’s Oversight Board will now hear appeals from Threads users, too",2024-02-22T13:00:03+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/metas-oversight-board-will-now-hear-appeals-from-threads-users-too-130003273.html?src=rss,"Meta’s Oversight Board is expanding its purview to include Threads. The group announced that Threads users will now be able to appeal Meta’s content moderation decisions, giving the independent group the ability to influence policies for Meta’s newest app. It’s a notable expansion for the Oversight Board, which up until now has weighed in on content moderation issues related to Facebook and Instagram posts. “Having independent accountability early on for a new app such as Threads is vitally important.,” board co-chair Helle Thorning-Schmidt said in a statement. According to the Oversight Board, user appeals on Threads will function similarly to how they do on Instagram and Facebook. When users have “exhausted” Meta’s internal process, they’ll be able to request a review from the Oversight Board. Under the rules established when the board was formed, Meta is required to implement the board's decisions regarding specific posts, but isn’t obligated to adhere to its policy recommendations. Adding Threads’ content moderation to the board’s scope underscores the growing influence of the Twitter-like app that launched last summer. Threads has already grown to 130 million users and Mark Zuckerberg has speculated that it could one day reach a billion users. Officially, Threads has the same rules as Instagram. But Meta has already encountered some pushback from users over its policies for recommending content. Threads currently blocks search terms related to COVID-19 and other “potentially sensitive” topics. The company also raised some eyebrows when it said last week that it wouldn’t recommend accounts that post too much political content unless users choose to opt-in to such suggestions. Regardless of whether the board ends up weighing in on those choices, it will likely be some time before Threads users see any changes as the result of the board’s recommendations. The Oversight Board only accepts a tiny fraction of user appeals, and it can take several weeks or months for the group to make a decision, and many more months for Meta to change any of its rules as a result of the guidance. (The board can, in some cases, expedite the process.) Peter Higgs, the famous physicist who predicted the Higgs boson particle, has passed away at the age of 94.

Meta faces down a media more obsessed with peddling influence than public interest,2024-03-04T23:44:22+00:00,https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/05/meta-zuckerberg-news-media-bargaining-code/,"Support independent journalism Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Governments should fund public interest journalism, rather than slug foreign tech companies to prop up our dying media oligopoly. Bernard Keane Mar 05, 2024  49 Just as in early 2021, when the Morrison government introduced its shakedown of the big tech companies at the behest of Australia’s corporate media, the level of gaslighting, self-interest and conflict of interest being served up by media over the role of tech giants in funding journalism is extraordinary. Facebook’s refusal to submit to the shakedown — AKA the news media bargaining code — has elicited cries of outrage and demands for a declaration of regulatory war from News Corp, Nine and Kerry Stokes’ Seven West Media, which continue to lie to their audiences that this is about tech giants paying for content they are stealing from news media. What it’s really about is the way big tech has developed a new advertising model, one far more effective than its now rather quaint strategy of spraying advertising at as many people as possible in the hope of reaching the small minority interested in and capable of buying a particular goods or service. Moreover, traditional media companies have been the victims of a decoupling of news from whole asset classes of advertising, like property and cars, moved online, to sites owned by… erm… traditional media companies. The logic of the news media bargaining code isn’t that of ending a rip-off perpetrated by foreign tech giants. Instead, it’s similar to Coles and Woolworths successfully demanding, on the basis of all the great work they’ve done for the community, that the government forcibly transfer profit from an international competitor that had successfully disrupted their business model. At least in the case of the supermarket duopoly, selling necessities to the community is their core business model. In the case of Nine, public interest journalism is an occasional side effect of its main entertainment business model. In the case of News Corp and Seven, there is virtually no public interest journalism to speak of, only right-wing propaganda. The shrieks of rage currently coming from the media are like those of gangsters whose rich target has stopped paying protection money. Like many Australian companies, News Corp, Seven and Nine devote as much effort to trying to influence regulatory outcomes in their favour as they do to providing goods and services to consumers and other business. From streaming content regulations, to cross-media rules, to the near-abolition of licence fees, to their resistance to gambling advertising regulation and — in the case of Seven and Nine — anti-siphoning, the big media companies are assiduous in lobbying, threatening, cajoling and otherwise encouraging major party politicians to look after them, almost always successfully. Such efforts are now increasingly desperate because, unlike in the era of mass media that ended around 2008 with the arrival of ...",-2
Meta will delete your Quest account (and games) unless you update soon,2024-03-04T21:38:41+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/meta-will-delete-your-quest-account-if-you-dont-make-this-change-soon/,"Meta will delete your Oculus account on March 29, 2024, if you’re still using the old Quest login method. If you’re a longtime Quest 2 owner, you might have a big library of VR games at risk. This shouldn’t come as a surprise. Meta started moving people away from Oculus to a Facebook account as far back as 2020. That move was met with resistance and Meta removed the requirement for Quest users to sign in with Facebook, allowing the use of a Meta account instead. If you recently created a new account to play mixed reality games on your Meta Quest 3, you don’t have to do anything. This only affects older accounts created for the Oculus Rift, original Quest, and Quest 2. Meta allowed plenty of time to make the transition — over a year to switch to a Meta account that doesn’t have to be linked to Facebook. Now we’ve come full circle and it’s time for Quest owners to switch if they haven’t yet. Despite the early warning, some people were suspicious of a recent email reminder and warning from Meta about the need to update to a Meta account. Redditor tangentlyric posted the email they received, asking if it was a “fake email.” It’s good to be wary of scams, but in this case, it’s real. You need to update your Quest login to use a Meta account or you’ll lose access to all the games, apps, and downloadable content you’ve purchased, as well as your friends list and other Oculus account data. It’s easy to make the switch and Meta guides you through the process. Simply visit Meta’s account setup website and follow the instructions to create a new account to replace your Oculus login. Meta says you can also “Open the Oculus mobile app on your phone or put on your headset and follow the on-screen instructions.” Meta's Quest 2 is the world's most popular VR headset, and the latest Quest 3 is selling well and will quickly reach second place. However, the Vision Pro will arrive within days. While Apple's VR headset outclasses Meta's best in every way, the self-proclaimed ""metaverse"" company is reportedly optimistic about Apple entering the market. The timing of the Quest 3's launch in October 2023 was perfect, riding the wave of excitement Apple created about mixed reality with the Vision Pro announcement four months earlier. Meta captured VR holiday sales before Apple's headset was available and now benefits from increased media coverage and comparisons of the Vision Pro and Quest 3, often with a focus on the vast price difference. Profile views of the Apple Vision Pro (top) and Meta Quest Pro Digital Trends Following rumors of a new extended reality (XR) headset, LG CEO Cho Joo-wan made the news official, confirming it could arrive as early as 2025. For documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, Office is the go-to suite of apps many rely on. Trying to work on a small laptop screen can be restrictive, so Microsoft teamed up with Meta to bring owners of the excellent new Quest 3 a potential solution to work in VR.

Meta is accused of engaging in a “scheme to exploit young users for profit,” including by showing harmful content that keeps them glued to their screens. According to one recent poll, 17-year-olds in the US spend 5.8 hours per day on social media. How did it come to this? The answer, in a word, is “engagement.” Deploying algorithms to maximize user engagement is how Big Tech maximizes shareholder value, with short-term profits often overriding longer-term business objectives, not to mention societal health. As the data scientist Greg Linden puts it, algorithms built on “bad metrics” foster “bad incentives” and enable “bad actors.” Although Facebook started as a basic service that connected friends and acquaintances online, its design gradually evolved not to meet user needs and preferences, but to keep them on the platform and away from others. In pursuit of this objective, the company regularly disregarded explicit consumer preferences regarding the kind of content users wanted to see, their privacy, and data sharing. Putting immediate profits first means funneling users toward “clicks,” even though this approach generally favors inferior, sensational material, rather than fairly rewarding participants from across a broader ecosystem of content creators, users and advertisers. We call these profits “algorithmic attention rents,” because they are generated by passive ownership (like a landlord) rather than from entrepreneurial production to meet consumers’ needs. Mapping rents in today’s economy requires understanding how dominant platforms exploit their algorithmic control over users. When an algorithm degrades the quality of the content it promotes, it is exploiting users’ trust and the dominant position that network effects reinforce. That is why Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can get away with cramming their feeds with ads and “recommended” addictive content. As the tech writer Cory Doctorow has colorfully put it, platform “enshittification comes out of the barrel of an algor...",1

Ramadan Business Insights: Meta’s Guide To Meaningful Customer Engagement,2024-03-04T16:58:03+00:00,https://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2024/03/04/ramadan-business-insights-metas-guide-to-meaningful-customer-engagement/,"As the holy month of Ramadan draws near, 2 billion Muslims around the world eagerly anticipate a period of spiritual introspection and communal unity. Many describe it as a ‘reset button’ – a time when people reevaluate their habits and strengthen their connections with their family and community. During this moment of reflection, businesses worldwide are faced with a critical question – how can they respectfully engage with their customers and season’s spirit of giving and coming together. Discovery Mindset According to the latest 2023 YouGov study commissioned by Meta[1] to study online behaviours of Ramadan observers, over three quarters (¾) of Ramadan observers globally change their habits during Ramadan, while 72% tend to look at new sources of information. The number is even higher in the UAE and KSA, reaching almost 80% in both markets[2]. This openness also has an impact on the so-called “discovery mindset”, with 72% of consumers in the UAE browsing Facebook and Instagram for shopping inspiration during Ramadan.[3] For businesses, this discovery leads to more than sales. The more personalised an ad is, the stronger the connection point that it creates stacking up to a meaningful, durable relationship between a business and its customers. Today, AI-powered ad tools like Meta’s Advantage+ can help businesses optimise their ad personalisation efforts and give a noticeable boost to a campaign driving up to 32% increase in return on ad spend.[4] Connecting through Storytelling There are more ways than ever to create meaningful connections this Ramadan. With brand storytelling tools such as Reels, branded content, in-stream video and AR masks, businesses can bring communities together through rich and immersive experiences.  According to a 2022 study by Meta, 65% of Ramadan observers spend more time watching videos during Ramadan and Eid.[5] A Meta-commissioned Global Consumer Short-Form Video Survey by Factwork[6] also revealed that Reels are highly effective when it comes to attracting new customers with three quarters (¾) of respondents having followed a business after watching its Reels on Instagram. With that in mind, adding ads on Reels helps brands supercharge their results. As part of Meta’s larger performance ecosystem, Reels ads are powered by AI leading to much better outcomes. For instance, during Ramadan 2023 Maggi Arabia marketing team effectively leveraged ads on Reels to showcase their products and recipes in a fun, entertaining and highly shareable way leading to a 9.9% increase in ad recall. Partnering with creators The influence of creators in social media discovery during Ramadan has steadily risen. Today, creators are more than channels — they offer creativity, authenticity, and impactful connections with audiences, translating into real business outcomes. A YouGov study commissioned by Meta highlighted this shift, revealing that 71% of Facebook and Instagram users have taken a shopping action influenced by creator content....",2
Rape in the Metaverse: The U’s Response to Virtual Sexual Assaults,2024-03-04T16:30:34+00:00,https://dailyutahchronicle.com/2024/03/04/virtual-sexual-assault-oeo-upd/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=virtual-sexual-assault-oeo-upd,"  Virtual realities and simulation games have existed for years. One of the first virtual spaces, “Maze War,” was created in 1973. Popular games and platforms like “Second Life,” “Virtuality” and “Meta Quest” followed this release to grow the virtual world.  VR was created to allow people to play in a simulation of their life. Like in real life, people (or avatars) can make choices and engage in interactions with other characters — even if these actions are harmful. Last year, a girl younger than 16 from the U.K. was sexually assaulted in her VR experience. This event has led to discourse surrounding whether virtual sexual assault is a real issue, if people who engage in it should face repercussions in real life, if this is the start of a new wave of sexual violence and how authorities will handle these types of cyber crimes.  Ashley Guajardo, a professor in the University of Utah’s games department, says “games feel real to the people who play them.” Earlier versions of video games engaged with different sensory experiences, which has been extended to VR. “In the ’80s, you’re using your ears, you’re listening to what other people are saying … in the ’90s, you’re using your eyes, you’re reading the text on the screen,” Guajardo said. “In contemporary times, you’re using your eyes to see in the VR environment, you’re using your ears to hear in the VR environment.” Not only does VR use a combination of senses, but it can also use actual touch. Guajardo points to the example of “haptic vests,” or suits that simulate physical feelings in the game like gunshots, energy, explosions and recoils. Guajardo connects the experience of being in VR to a metaphor used by digital humanities academic Janet Murray, who compares being in a game to being underwater. “Your eyes, you see water. Your skin, you feel water. Your ears, your sound is distorted because you’re in water. All of your senses are completely immersed by water, ” Guajardo said. “That is the sensation that people feel when they’re in a video game.” Guajardo also points out that companies frequently use the hyperrealism of a video game as a selling point. Even with educational games, Guajardo says the player is “so immersed … so close to real life.” Players can learn things from playing the game, but this hyperrealism for good experiences also means that the hyperrealism exists for potentially harmful experiences. “The virtual worlds we’re interacting with can be as real as our ordinary physical world,” David Chalmers, a professor of philosophy and neural science at New York University, told The Guardian. “Virtual reality is genuine reality.” If a player experiences negative events in a gaming space, they are likely to process it the same way they would a negative event in real life. Some studies suggest that the brain cannot differentiate between real and imaginary threats and experiences. “The exact same stress response kicks in when you imagine danger, also producing cortisol and [adrenaline] an...",-1
Mark Zuckerberg Geeks Out Over Million-Dollar Watch at Indian Pre-Wedding,2024-03-04T16:12:42+00:00,https://www.tmz.com/2024/03/04/mark-zuckerberg-admires-anant-ambani-million-dollar-watch-india-wedding/,"Mark Zuckerberg was caught geeking out over a fellow billionaire's pricey watch -- and it's spurring quite a reaction online. The Meta CEO and his wife, Priscilla Chan, were filmed making small talk at Anant Ambani's pre-wedding celebration weekend in Gujarat, India -- which included a rare performance from Rihanna, who was reportedly paid $6 million for the gig. Mark Zuckerberg has become very good at small talk. Here he pretends to be impressed at some dude’s watch. And succeeds. This is bullish for AI, $META and $INDA. pic.twitter.com/LhPBKcgCUz Everyone was dressed to the nines ... as was instructed in an alleged nine-page dress code -- but it was Anant's pricey timepiece that caught the attention of Mark. The Facebook founder was seen practically drooling over the Richard Mille watch worn by Anant -- whose father, Mukesh Ambani, is Asia's richest man and reportedly worth $112 billion. Mark says in the video ... ""You know I never really wanted a watch but after seeing that I was like, 'watches are cool.'"" Mukesh hosted a 3-day rager -- attended by VIP guests Bill Gates, Hillary Clinton, Ivanka Trump and Google CEO Sundar Pichai -- in honor of Anant's upcoming nuptials to businesswoman Radhika Merchant at his home in Gujarat. And while the festivities cost a pretty penny -- a reported $152 million, FWIW -- it took place yards away from some of the poorest people in the world ... next to a slum, no less. So ... not that surprising people are finding Mark's behavior a little cringe-y considering what he was doing, and where they were. The pre-wedding weekend wasn't without a little charity. The couple of the hour was photographed hosting a communal dinner for 51,000 locals -- so the bash wasn't totally tone-deaf. Yes! Send me email updates and offers from TMZ and its Affiliates.

		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, were seen gushing over Indian billionaire Anant Ambani’s $1 million watch during an opulent pre-wedding bash held in Jamnagar this weekend.  Video taken during the lavish pre-wedding party attended by more than 1,000 global billionaires, heads of state and A-list celebrities shows Chan asking Ambani, 28, about his “fantastic” luxury timepiece made by Richard Mille. “I know, I told him already,” Zuckerberg immediately chimes in. “You know, I never really wanted a watch, but after seeing that, I was like, ‘Watches are cool.'”  “I might want that,” Chan can be heard saying as the video clip ends.  Zuckerberg and Chan were among many featured on the star-studded guest list during this weekend’s pre-wedding celebrations for Ambani and his wife-to-be, Radhika Merchant. Ambani is the youngest son of India’s richest man, Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani, who boasts a jaw-dropping net worth of $116.8 billion, while his fiancée is the daughter of Viren Merchant, CEO of Encore Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., and entrepreneur Shaila Merchant. The nearly 1,200-person guest list also included Bill Gates, Sunder Pichai and Ivanka Trump; Indian billionaires Gautam Adani and Kumar Mangalam Birla; legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar; and Bollywood celebrities such as Deepika Padukone, Shah Rukh Khan and Rani Mukherjee. The festivities lasted through Sunday and even included a performance by Rihanna.  Advertisement",0

"After Meta’s exit, where to next for Australia’s news media bargaining code?",2024-03-04T01:29:00+00:00,https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/04/meta-facebook-news-media-bargaining-code-crikey-clarifier/,"Support independent journalism Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au The Australian government is set for a second-round showdown with Meta after the tech company dumped funding deals with news publishers. Labor's key weapon is the news media bargaining code. But what is the code, exactly? Daanyal Saeed Mar 04, 2024  6 Last week, the Australian media industry jumped on a unity ticket, with several outlets coming together to advocate that the Albanese government enforce its news media bargaining code. The reason was tech giant Meta’s largely anticipated announcement that it wouldn’t be renewing its deals with Australian news publishers, negotiated in 2021 after the introduction of the code by the Morrison government.  The proposal of the code, designed to force tech companies to pay publishers for the news media distributed on their platforms, initially saw Facebook respond by removing news from Australian feeds and restricting links for Australian viewers over five dystopian days in February 2021 while the Coalition scrambled to negotiate a new framework with Meta (owner of Facebook and Instagram) and Google.  The code that eventually passed saw the treasurer given the ability to “designate” tech companies as subject to bargaining obligations if they didn’t pass satisfactory deals with individual Australian publishers to pay for displaying news on their platforms.  Facebook, as well as Google, reached a number of voluntary agreements with Australian publishers, and subsequently were not designated under the code. The deals have provided Australian media companies, including the ABC and Nine, with collectively up to $200 million, according to the government. They are due to expire in the next few months. The Financial Review’s Sam Buckingham-Jones also published the contents of Meta’s expiring deal with Network Ten on Monday morning, with the summaries showing what social media managers around the country already knew: Facebook placed an outsized value on video content. Ten’s deal was worth almost $14 million over three years, but included requirements for Ten to post over 18,000 video clips throughout the deal.  In deciding whether to designate a platform, the treasurer must consider whether:  That state of affairs, which saw Australian media companies compensated and the Australian public able to consume news through their regular channels, is set to be shaken up, with Meta announcing it will pull out of its news contracts after three years.  While Meta has committed to not blocking access to Australian news, the company has said that Australian users would no longer have access to “Facebook News”, a separate tab in the Facebook app.  Meta said that the decision came as a result of changing consumer trends.  “This is part of an ongoing effort to better align our investments to our products and services people value the most,” the company said in a statement. The company claims that the number of people using Facebook News in Australia and the US ...",-2
‘Never Pick a Fight With An Infinite Amount Of Paper And Ink’ – Media Buyers React To Facebook’s Stoush With Publishers,2024-03-04T01:07:52+00:00,https://www.bandt.com.au/never-pick-a-fight-with-an-infinite-amount-of-paper-and-ink-media-buyers-react-to-facebooks-stoush-with-publishers/,"Returning member? 
Sign in Home » ‘Never Pick a Fight With An Infinite Amount Of Paper And Ink’ – Media Buyers React To Facebook’s Stoush With Publishers Meta’s decision to walk away from news content deals has angered publishers and the Government, but will advertisers care? Media buyers and agency bosses, who spoke to B&T under the condition of anonymity, weigh in. Facebook officially unfriended publishers by revealing it plans to walk away from news content deals when the current lot expires. The social media company said news content traffic had plummeted by 80 per cent in the past year and that  users no longer visit Facebook for news. For the past three years, Facebook has paid Australia’s largest publishers for professionally curated content shared on its platform. Content deals are estimated to be worth north of $200m each year; Paramount-owned Network Ten’s deals with Facebook are alone worth about $14.5m over three years. Brokers at Macquarie estimate that Nine, Seven and News Corp will lose between 5 and 9 per cent of their net profits each year if the deals don’t continue. The move has angered media company executives and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who described it as “not the Australian way”, but will Facebook’s primary funders – advertisers – be dismayed? B&T approached media buyers and agency bosses to get a gauge. Due to the sensitive nature of the issue – media agencies nurture relationships with media companies and Meta – they agreed to speak under the condition of anonymity. One agency group leader told B&T that although private sector companies are entitled to allocate their time and resources to suit the needs of customers – Facebook claims news only accounts for 3 per cent of content consumed and is not a priority – the decision raises questions about the value equation between publishers and social media platforms. “Facebook does not think content posted on its platform drives traffic but media companies beg to differ,” the agency boss said. “The irony is that Facebook once encouraged media companies to post sticky news content onto the platform because it would drive traffic to their websites. Clearly there has been a change of heart.” Several media buyers said that regulators need to finally draw a line in the sand over whether Facebook is a publisher or distributor of content. “If it is distributing the work of media companies to drive attention on its platform, and without any compensation, then is that fair? This feels like a debate that has gone on for years and been lobbied out of the headlines,” one buyer explained.  Facebook’s move to abandon news is part of a wider global push rather than a specific attack Australia’s media industry. Nonetheless, a media agency boss who has witnessed previous battles between organisations and the press, believes Meta has made a powerful adversary. “A problem that Facebook now has is the old saying, ‘never pick a fight with an infinite amount of paper and ink’, and you can th...",-2
Zuckerberg’s abandonment of Australian media leaves journalists fighting for scraps,2024-03-03T23:05:44+00:00,https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/04/meta-australian-media-funding-news-media-bargaining-code/,"Support independent journalism Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au The expiration of Meta's funding will certainly be felt by the Australian media giants — but it's the journalists who'll be most affected. James Hennessy Mar 04, 2024  42 US tech titan Meta, owner of Facebook, announced last week that it is ending its brief commitment to funding Australian journalism. In 2021, the company, along with Google, struck content deals with local publishers in response to the passage of the news media bargaining code, which forced the two companies to the negotiating table to pay for the local news content they display. Now, with those deals expiring, Meta wants out. Behind the theatrics of power and the interests of Australia’s media giants, it represents another looming threat to journalism as a profession.  Meta claims, by way of justification, that the number of people using its Facebook News feature has collapsed by 80% in the past year as content consumption habits migrate towards short-form video, popularised by TikTok and Meta’s own Instagram Reels. This is quite plausible, but it is not an agnostic process the company is passively observing from the sidelines. Meta has considerable latitude over the content it distributes to its users and the form in which it appears. If Facebook users are consuming less news, it’s largely because Facebook is showing them less of it. Meta’s plan to escape the news game is a long-running project. Even before Australia’s world-leading effort to extract rents from major tech platforms for the benefit of publishers (now copied by the United Kingdom and Canada), the Mark Zuckerberg-led company was feeling the heat on news content. News was an enormous growth engine for Facebook in the 2010s, but mounting pressure from politicians, regulators and the press around election influence and political power has led the company to look elsewhere for user engagement. Threads, the company’s recently launched Twitter clone, won’t show political content at all unless users specifically request it. Despite the bellyaching from the Australian government and consumer protection bodies like the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over Meta’s decision, there was little reason to believe the news media bargaining code was anything but a temporary salve to a far deeper problem. Its functionally clumsy approach, which hinged on imposing a de facto tax on links to Australian publishers’ content, could only work as long as that remained the way Australians accessed news. In a world where content is just as likely to appear in a 30-second video, or stripped down and churned out by generative AI, it no longer feels fit for purpose. This leaves Australian publishers in a tough position. It is no secret the media companies covered by the news media bargaining code have used the funds raised by these deals — estimated as being worth up to $70 million a year from Meta alone — to hire journalists and expand news teams.

"Meta Deal Required Network 10 To Share 18,000 Videos On Facebook",2024-03-03T22:59:03+00:00,https://www.bandt.com.au/meta-deal-required-network-10-to-share-18000-videos-on-facebook/,"Returning member? 
Sign in Home » Meta Deal Required Network 10 To Share 18,000 Videos On Facebook Following Friday’s controversial news that Facebook is abandoning its news content deals with local content providers, the Australian Financial Review has shed some light on the nature of the deals. Summary agreements obtained by the AFR, owned by Nine, show that Network 10 was required to upload some 18,000 videos to Facebook in return for funding from Meta. The first contract between Network 10 and Meta (then named Facebook) began on June 15, 2021 with Meta agreeing to pay Network 10 USD$2,750,000 (AUD $4,215,062) for the three years that content is posted. Once Facebook has recouped its net expenditure, Network 10 would be entitled to 55 per cent of any additional net advertising revenue. The funds were paid monthly in a lump sum of $US229,166.67 (AUD$351,254). The deal was approved by six people at Network 10 including Paramount’s chief content officer Beverley McGarvey. The second agreement was between Network 10 and Facebook Ireland for $400,000 a year. This was an “agreement to monetise articles created by The Project on the Facebook News Surface platform via a content feed from 10Play”. As per this agreement, Network 10 agreed to post 6000 clips a year from its news shows including 5pm bulletin 10 News First, Studio 10 and The Project. The clips had to be a certain length and posted at certain times. The 1500 videos had to be at least three minutes long and had to be posted no later than 6 hours after the show ended. For The Project they could be posted 12 hours after The Project ended. If clips from these shows couldn’t be posted for any reason then Network 10 would need to suggest relevant videos “of equivalent or greater value, quantity, and quality”. The contracts funded several roles at Network 10 responsible for sharing video content to Facebook, sources with knowledge of the deals said. The deal included termination rights, in which Facebook was able to terminate the deal if it decided to pull news from its platform or if Meta was designated under the code. The financial impact of Meta pulling out of its deals with local providers is expected to be substantial. Brokers at Macquarie estimate that Nine, Seven, and News Corp will lose between 5 and 9 per cent of their net profits each year if the deals don’t continue. Media outlets including Seven, Nine, and News Corp expressed their disappointment with the Meta’s decision on Friday with Nine CEO Mike Sneesby saying “Meta’s decision does not recognise the significant and increasing value of Nine’s journalism, unique content and brands to its platforms”. A Network 10 spokesperson said: “We are disappointed with the decision by Meta announcing it will no longer pay for use of Australian news content on Facebook. “It is essential that Australian news media services are fairly remunerated for their trusted, local and impartial news content. Without fair compensation, it becomes increasingly ...",-2

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Toronto-based AI chip startup Tenstorrent CEO Jim Keller visited Korea last week. Just a month after the visit of Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, the two tech titans seemed to hurry to visit here for consultations on their cooperation with tech industry figures here, according to industry sources on Sunday. Sources believe the three Big Tech leaders traveled to Korea to find opportunities by establishing independent supply and demand systems by bolstering business alliances with Samsung Electronics, LG Electronics and SK hynix before the AI and extended reality markets fully mature while challenging the market dominance of Nvidia and Apple. “Depending on who takes the lead, the global industrial map in the next decade may be noticeably changed from what it is now. Therefore, the (Big Tech) chiefs chose to secure the specialized technological capabilities (of Samsung, SK and LG) by enhancing cooperation as a shortcut,” an industry insider who wished to remain anonymous told The Korea Herald. Zuckerberg met with business leaders here including Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jae-yong and LG Electronics CEO Cho Joo-wan, separately, during his three-day visit as part of an Asia tour, to discuss ways to expand cooperation in cutting-edge technologies, in AI chip development and the extended reality business. The Meta CEO recently pledged to build artificial general intelligence, or AGI, and work on a new AI chip. Samsung has also established the AGI Computing Lab, comprising a group of the world’s most talented researchers and engineers in the tech sector, in Silicon Valley, northern California. LG recently launched a team under its TV business unit that is dedicated to XR technology development, while hiring experts in the field since early this year, as it considers commercializing XR devices over several years. After meeting with Zuckerberg, LG chief hinted that its first collaboration device with Meta will likely come out in 2025. Meta released its virtual...",2

Facebook will stop paying newspaper publishers and will shut down its news section entirely, saying that people do not come to the social network for news or political content. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, said it would wind down deals with US and Australian publishers and remove a news tab that had served users a feed of articles next month. It said people would still be able to read news on Facebook posted by their friends and by accounts they follow, including those of news publishers. Telegraph  British telecommunications giant BT says it expects to launch its first so-called stand-alone 5G network in 2024.Howard Watson, BT’s chief technology officer, told CNBC that the telco group plans to switch on its stand-alone 5G network, which is often referred to in the industry as “true” 5G, later this year. “Others are talking about it. They’re talking about it. But we are working to get the right ecosystem in place, which means the right set of devices,” Watson said in an interview with CNBC at the Mobile World Congress tech trade show in Barcelona, Spain. CNBC Back in mid-February, Apple announced that iOS 17.4 would remove support for progressive web apps in the EU. The company blamed this on the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which goes into effect next week and is the reason why iOS 17.4 will come with support for alternative app stores. Following a huge amount of online backlash, today Apple has changed its mind and revealed that progressive web apps will still be supported even in iOS 17.4 in the EU. So, like before, you’ll be able to add a progressive web app to your home screen. GSM Arena The price of Bitcoin is close to its all-time high, thanks in large part to US finance giants. Investment firms like Grayscale, BlackRock and Fidelity, are pouring billions of dollars into buying the volatile digital asset. In the last few weeks, these powerful institutions have become so called ‘Bitcoin whales’. Because of Bitcoin’s system there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. 19 million have been created, but many are already accounted for and probably off the market.

It is now the oldest Mac in Apple’s current crop, having not been updated in 600 days. But rumors suggest that is unlikely to be the case for much longer.

The gains marked the second straight closing record for the Nasdaq, which also set an intraday record as AI-related names such as Nvidia and Meta Platforms led it past its prior peak of 16,212.23 set in November 2021. Through the end of February, the three major indexes notched their fourth straight month of gains in a rally largely fueled by growth prospects related to AI, which has also lifted semiconductor names. On Friday, shares of Nvidia climbed 4 per cent and closed above $2 trillion in market value for the first time. Rival Advanced Micro Devices shares gained 5.25 per cent to a record high close of $202.64, while the broader Philadelphia semiconductor index also closed at a record after a jump of 4.29 per cent on the session. Markets have drawn support from a resilient economy, as investors have tried to gauge the timing of the first interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, with investors currently targeting June and growing expectations the central bank can engineer a soft landing for the economy. ""Because the economy is doing well and because inflation remains a bit sticky, the Fed will be slower to lower interest rates,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. ""But that's good because then we're gradually coming off of the higher interest rate cycle and we're not in need of cutting rates aggressively.""

For the week, the S&P 500 gained 0.95 per cent, the Nasdaq rose 1.74 per cent, and the Dow fell 0.11 per cent.

Meta says it’s deleting all Oculus accounts at the end of the month,2024-03-01T21:51:19+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/1/24087855/meta-delete-oculus-accounts,"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  If you still haven’t migrated your Oculus account to a Meta one, you might want to do that soon. In an email sent to users, the company says it will delete Oculus accounts on March 29th, 2024, preventing you from reactivating or retrieving your apps, in-app purchases, store credits, and more. You’ll lose your achievements, friends list, and any content created with your Oculus account if you don’t migrate to a Meta account before then. Oculus accounts have been on the way out since 2020, when the company then known as Facebook started requiring new users to sign up with Facebook accounts instead. However, it added the ability to create a Meta account in 2022, offering an alternative to users who didn’t want to link their Facebook account to their Quest headset. Meta stopped letting users log in to their Oculus accounts in January 2023. If you’ve got a Quest gathering dust in a drawer somewhere, now’s your last chance to migrate your Oculus account to a Meta one. You can migrate your account by heading to this page and signing up for a Meta account with the same email you’ve used for Oculus. From there, you’ll be able to access all of the same games, data, and other purchases saved to your Oculus account.  Several of us here at The Verge received the email, including a couple of my colleagues who have already converted their Oculus accounts to Meta. It’s not clear whether Meta sent these emails by mistake or if there’s any action Meta account holders will need to take.

EC to grill Meta on Facebook ‘subscription for no ads’ plan,2024-03-01T21:15:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3713382/ec-to-grill-meta-on-facebook-subscription-for-no-ads-plan.html#tk.rss_all," The European Commission (EC) on Friday said it needs more information from Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta to assess its compliance with applicable privacy and security laws in the European Union (EU). The EC, in a statement, said Meta also needs to speed up its responses to requests in December for information, which centered on election information, terrorism and the protection of minors. The company has until March 15 to provide that information, with the new info about Meta’s pay-to-opt-out-of-tracking program due March 22. The  EC noted that, like all companies doing business in the EU and subject to the Digital Services Act, Meta could be subject to hefty fines for providing incomplete information or missing deadlines. European data protection authorities have levied heavy GDPR fines against a range of businesses, not just social media giants. “The present [request for information]  builds on Meta’s previous replies and asks additional information concerning the methodology underlying Meta’s risk assessment and mitigation measures reports, the protection of minors, elections and manipulated media,” the EC said. “The RFI also requests Meta to provide information related to the practice of so-called shadow banning and the launch of Threads.” The Digital Services Act was approved in April 2022. It governs how internet companies must manage user data, how they are allowed to use that data to target advertising, and steps they must take to police illicit or deceptive content. “It will ensure that the online environment remains a safe space, safeguarding freedom of expression and opportunities for digital businesses,” EC president Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement at the time. The latest request for information aimed at Meta comes a day after eight consumer protection watchdog groups in the EU filed complaints against the company for its opaque data collection and processing policies. The complaints, filed with national data protection authorities, accuse Meta of violating the GDPR, abusing its dominant market position to misuse customer information, and making merely superficial changes to its privacy policy instead of actually complying with the law. European authorities have long had Meta in their sights, having fined the company more than $2 billion since the GDPR took effect in 2018.

Meta is starting to test the Threads API with third-party developers,2024-03-01T20:01:25+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-starting-to-test-the-threads-api-with-third-party-developers-200125403.html?src=rss,"Meta is starting to bring the Threads API online, though it will still be some time before it’s widely accessible to developers. The company has begun testing its new developer tools with a handful of companies, Meta engineer Jesse Chen shared in a post on Threads. According to Chen, whose post was first spotted by TechCrunch, the API is currently in “beta” but a wider rollout could come “by the end of June.” The initial group of companies testing out the beta version of the API include social media management platforms Sprinklr, Hootsuite, Social News Desk and Sprout Social. Meta is also working with tech news aggregator Techmeme and live video platform Grabyo. For now, it sounds like the API will primarily enable the publishing of content to Threads from these services, but Chen said there are also plans to “enable reply moderation and insights capabilities.” Having an API could help Threads attract more publishers and power users, who often rely on third-party software for posting and analytics. Instagram head Adam Mosseri has previously expressed some reluctance to woo publishers, saying that his “concern” was that a dedicated API would “mean a lot more publisher content and not much more creator content.” (Mosseri has also said he doesn’t want to “amplify news on the platform.”) But with 130 million users, Threads is starting to look more and more like a viable alternative to X, and offering professional-level tools is a good way to get publishers and brands to post more to the platform. Having an API could also, potentially, aid the company’s plans to support interoperability with Mastodon and the rest of the fediverse, though Meta hasn’t publicly discussed its API in that context,.

Meta will no longer cough up cash for Australian news. What will it mean for Facebook and Instagram feeds?,2024-03-01T18:37:50+00:00,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-02/facebook-google-news-media-deal-media-pay-meta/103534342," Meta is ending its deals to pay for Australian news content. This is how it could change your Facebook and Instagram feeds If you ever get your daily news fix by scrolling through Facebook and Instagram, you may soon be seeing a whole lot less. For the past three years, Facebook owner Meta has been paying Australian news media organisations for their content. This has come at a cost of around $70 million a year, which has been helping many newsrooms across the country grow or stay afloat.  But on Friday, the $1.8 trillion tech giant announced it no longer wants to cough up cash for Australian news that appears on its platforms.  Meta informed Australian publishers on Friday that it won't be renewing the deals it made when the government introduced a highly contentious media bargaining bill. It also announced it will be shutting down Facebook's news tab features in Australia and the United States. The move has led to widespread backlash from the government and the country's biggest news outlets who are calling it an attack on the media. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told Channel 7 that journalists should be paid for the work they do.  ""And some multinational company just being able to get that free ride off the back of the hard work of news organisations here in Australia is not on,"" he said.  ""The government will look at all the options that are available to us. But we don't believe that Meta’s response — they make a lot of money, the idea they should just get free access undermines journalism."" He said Meta shouldn't get a ""free ride"".  ""But we think that a fair thing is for people to pay for any product that is the results of people's hard work. ""It is just fair."" The last time Meta and the government went into battle, it resulted in Facebook imposing an eight-day block on Australian news. So what could be the fate of our news feeds now? The Australian government wanted local publishers to benefit when links to their news content appeared on sites like Facebook and Google.  It argued that there was significant advertising revenue being generated from this ""premium content"" and media organisations were missing out on their cut. So in 2021, the Morrison government introduced the News Media Bargaining Code, which aimed to address ""bargaining power imbalances"" by requiring tech giants to pay for displaying news on their platforms.  Under the code, the government can ""designate"" digital platforms like Facebook and Google and force them into mediation to set terms for a revenue-sharing deal. If they don't cooperate, they could face fines. So far, no company has been designated by the federal government. The highly contentious media bargaining bill just passed Parliament, but don't rule out another Facebook news ban just yet. Instead, Meta and Google struck a flurry of independent deals with news companies, all of which are due to expire in the next few months. The deals, with organisations including the ABC, Nine and News Corp, have brought around...",-3
Threads says it will make its API broadly available by June,2024-03-01T18:32:25+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/threads-says-it-will-make-its-api-broadly-available-by-june/,"Meta-owned social network Threads said today that it will make its API broadly available to developers by June. Engineer Jesse Chen posted that the company has been building the API for the past few months. The API currently allows users to authenticate, publish threads and fetch the content they post through these tools. “Over the past few months, we’ve been building the Threads API to enable creators, developers, and brands to manage their Threads presence at scale and easily share fresh, new ideas with their communities from their favorite third-party applications,” he said. Chen added that the company is working with a limited number of partners, including social tools like Sprinklr, Sprout Social, Social News Desk, Hootsuite, tech news board Techmeme and a few other developers. The engineer added that Threads is looking to add more capabilities to APIs for moderation and insights gathering. Last October, Instagram head Adam Mosseri first confirmed that the social platform is working on an API to enable third-party experiences. At that time Chen had added that the company would start working on a content publishing endpoint. While the social network has added new capabilities to the API, it’s not clear if this will allow developers to build third-party clients to create a different way to experience Threads. Over the years, social networks have increased restrictions around access to user data for developers. This has stifled the third-party app ecosystem built for social platforms. Social networks are getting stingy with their data, leaving third-party developers in the lurch  Decentralized social networks such as Bluesky and Mastodon have allowed developers to create new apps. However, they have yet to reach the massive scale of the likes of Twitter/X, Reddit and Meta’s properties like Facebook and Instagram. While Meta has committed to adopting ActivityPub protocol for Threads and joining the fediverse, the company hasn’t spoken openly about allowing developers to build alternative Threads clients.",2

		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Meta Platforms decided against a partnership with Alphabet to use Google’s Android XR platform for its virtual and mixed-reality Quest headsets, The Information reported on Friday. Google had suggested that Meta partnered with its new software platform that is being developed for virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed-reality headsets, the report said, citing a source involved in the talks. But such a partnership could thwart Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s plan to “own the next computational platform for AR, VR and mixed reality,” according to the report. Meta is already talking to hardware companies, including South Korea’s LG Electronics, about building new VR devices using Quest’s software, the report said, quoting unnamed Meta employees. Meta and LG Electronics did not respond to Reuters request for comment, while Alphabet declined to comment.

Now the EU is asking questions about Meta’s ‘pay or be tracked’ consent model,2024-03-01T16:14:30+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/01/meta-rfi-dsa-ad-free-subscription/,"Meta’s controversial pay or be tracked ‘consent’ choice for users the European Union is facing questions from the European Commission. Today the bloc said it’s sent Facebook and Instagram’s owner a formal request for information (RFI) under the Digital Services Act (DSA), asking it to provide more detail on the “Subscription for no Ads options” it gives regional users of its two major social networks. “In particular, Meta should provide additional information on the measures it has taken to comply with its obligations concerning Facebook and Instagram’s advertising practices, recommender systems and risk assessments related to the introduction of that subscription option,” the Commission wrote in a press release. Meta was contacted for a response to the Commission’s RFI. But spokesman, Matthew Pollard, told us it has no comment at present. Meta made the controversial switch to a so-called “consent or pay” business model in the EU last fall, after challenges to two other legal bases it had claimed for processing users’ data for ad targeting forced it to rethink its approach. Meta’s ad-free subscription is controversial because under EU data protection law consent must be informed, specific and freely given if it’s to be valid. But the choice Meta has framed requires users to either pay it monthly subscriptions (starting at €9.99/month) in order to gain access to ad-free versions of the social networks — or else they must agree to being tracked and profiled for its targeted advertising. There is currently no way for EU users to access Facebook or Instagram for free without being tracked. Privacy and consumer rights groups quickly cried foul over Meta’s self-serving tactic and a raft of complaints have since been filed under EU data and consumer protection law — breaches of which can lead to fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover. (See: here, here, here and here.) Now the EU itself is stepping in with an RFI under the DSA, the bloc’s recently updated e-commerce rulebook. This separate pan-EU regulation has — since last August — applied a set of algorithmic accountability and transparency rules to larger online platforms (aka VLOPs), including Facebook and Instagram. The DSA is highly relevant because it stipulates that larger platforms must obtain consent from people to use their data for advertising; and that consent must comply with the bloc’s data protection rules and be as easy to withdraw as it is to provide. The regulation also entirely bans the use of sensitive data or minors’ data for ads — and it’s not clear how Meta prevents sensitive data from being processed by its ad targeting engines given how — for example — people’s political views may be inferred by its behavioral tracking and proxies used to target ads on sensitive categories. (The company claimed, back in 2021, to have removed advertisers’ abilities to target sensitive categories. But its ongoing tracking and profiling of users creates opportunities for advertisers to target ...",-3
"Meta to scrap news feature for Facebook users in US, Australia in latest broadside to media companies",2024-03-01T15:28:16+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/01/business/meta-to-scrap-news-tab-for-facebook-users-in-us-australia/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Meta said it will scrap Facebook’s news feature for US and Australian users in April – setting up a possible showdown with lawmakers in both countries who have ripped the tech giant’s treatment of the media industry. Meta said in a blog post late Thursday it “will not enter into new commercial deals for traditional news content in these countries and will not offer new Facebook products specifically for news publishers in the future.” Mark Zuckerberg’s social media giant said getting rid of Facebook’s “News Tab” was “part of an ongoing effort to better align our investments to our products and services people value the most.” The company said the number of people using the News Tab in both countries dropped by more than 80% in 2023. “As a company, we have to focus our time and resources on things people tell us they want to see more of on the platform, including short form video,” Meta said in the blog post. In the US, the removal of Facebook’s “News Tab” is the just the latest sign of pullback by Meta. In 2022, the company began telling US news publishers it would no longer pay for content and pulled all funding for the deals. On Friday, News/Media Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group that represents hundreds of news outlets, shredded Meta for ending the service. “This is consistent with Meta practices around the world to distance itself from news content,” News/Media Alliance president & CEO Danielle Coffey said. “Seems to be a conscious decision to steer away from quality and towards misinformation.” Meta informed outlets in Australia that it would not renew their deals at the same time the blog post went live on Friday, The Guardian reported. The country’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, blasted Meta’s decision, telling reporters it was “not the Australian way.” “We know that it’s absolutely critical that media is able to function properly and be properly funded,” Albanese said. “Journalism is important and the idea that research and work done by others can be taken free is simply untenable.” “Nobody should be under any doubts about the government’s resolve to ensure that we have a viable media industry in this country,” added Australia’s assistant treasurer Stephen Jones. The move came after Meta got rid of the News Tab in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany last year. Meta said the changes would “not impact the terms under our existing Facebook News agreements with publishers in Australia, France, and Germany,” and that its deal in the US and UK had already expired. Executive chairman Michael Miller of News Corp Australia – which shares a parent company with The Post – said he welcomed “the government’s support for the Australian media industry and its wholehearted commitment to upholding our laws and the News Media Bargaining Code.” “Meta is using its immense market power to refuse to negotiate, and the government i...",-2

Meta to drop 'Facebook News' tab in U.S. and Australia in April,2024-03-01T14:35:12+00:00,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/03/01/Meta-facebook-ends-news-tabs-United-States-Australia/2231709301140/,"


March 1 (UPI) -- Meta plans to remove the Facebook News tab from the social media platform in the United States and Australia in April.
The company said in a blog post Thursday that it made the decision because the feature was rarely used, adding that news makes up less than 3% of what users see in their feeds and asserting ""people don't come to Facebook for news and political content.""

""This is part of an ongoing effort to better align our investments to our products and services people value the most,"" Meta said. ""As a company, we have to focus our time and resources on things people tell us they want to see more of on the platform, including short-form video.""
The move comes after Meta removed the Facebook News tab in Britain, France and Germany last year.

The company noted that people in these countries will still be able to view news on their feeds and news publishers can still access and post news content including article links on the platform as well as utilizing other services such as advertisements and short-form ""Reels"" videos to expand their reach, while maintaining 100% of revenue from outgoing links on Facebook.

Former Instagram Offices In Downtown SF May Be About to Become TikTok Offices,2024-03-12T23:23:42+00:00,https://sfist.com/2024/03/12/former-instagram-offices-in-downtown-sf-may-be-about-to-become-tiktok-offices/,"In a clear sign of the times for social media, some newish, high-end office space in San Francisco's SoMa district that had been leased, pre-pandemic, by Meta when it was in a rapid growth phase, looks to be getting subleased by TikTok parent company ByteDance. At least three floors of what was a 34-floor office lease in 181 Fremont by Instagram and Facebook parent company Meta are the subject of ""ongoing discussions"" for a sublease by ByteDance, according to the SF Chronicle. We learned in January 2023 that Meta was looking to offload all 34 floors of the building that it had leased five years earlier, ostensibly to become the new headquarters of Instagram. We know that the space was at least partially occupied by Instagram workers between 2019 and 2020, but it was likely a fairly shortlived stay for many of them — once the buildout was complete and move-ins happened, the pandemic came along in March 2020 to make most office attendance verbotin, and later, highly optional.  We earlier understood, via the SF Business Times, that Instagram had 50 floors in 181 Fremont, but the Chronicle says it was 34 floors, or approximately 435,000 square feet. This represents the lower half of the building, and the entire office component of the tower, with the upper floors all being luxury residences. As the Chronicle notes, ""it was common [back in 2017] for big tech companies anticipating future growth to lease more space than they actually required,"" and it seems clear that Meta never really needed all that space. But at the time of the lease it was seen as Facebook's first acknowledgement that it needed a foothold in San Francisco if it was going to attract some top talent — who might be loath to live down on the Peninsula or suffer a two-hour roundtrip commute. The 181 Fremont offices had capacity for 2,000 workers, and Meta also took out a lease on a 755,000-square-foot office space in the nearby Park Tower at 250 Howard Street — which it has continued to hold on to. That has capacity for several thousand more workers who don't want to commute to Menlo Park. The entry of TikTok on the SF scene would also be a first for Chinese-owned ByteDance. The company had previously been looking at space in San Jose, and currently rents offices from WeWork at 600 California. Even if TikTok ended up occupying four floors in 181 Fremont, it would still leave much of the building still unoccupied. There has been at least one other taker, which is Navan, a travel tech company previously known as TripActions. They subleased 36,000 square feet, or about three floors worth, from Meta as of last fall. In related news, Donald Trump now no longer supports a ban on TikTok, because they compete with Facebook, and he really hates Facebook — and he apparently met with a TikTok investor recently.

Meta adds a new label to show whether third-party WhatsApp chats are secure,2024-03-12T09:31:30+00:00,https://betanews.com/2024/03/12/meta-adds-a-new-label-to-show-whether-third-party-whatsapp-chats-are-secure/,"New rules in Europe means that WhatsApp will have to offer interoperability with other messaging apps and platforms. This is something that Meta has already been talking about, having published its preference for third parties to use the Signal Protocol as the foundation for these E2EE communications. Use of the Signal Protocol will not be a requirement for interoperability, but whatever protocol is used by a third-party messaging app or platform, it will need to show they offer ""the same security guarantees as Signal"". To communicate security to users, WhatsApp is introducing a new ""end-to-end encrypted"" label that will be added to secure chats. See also: At the moment, the label can only be seen in the beta version of WhatsApp for Android -- and even then, it is not yet available to all beta testers. The security indicator appears at the top of a chat under the contact or group name. The label was spotted by WABetaInfo who shared the news on X: 📝 WhatsApp beta for Android 2.24.6.11: what's new?WhatsApp is rolling out a feature to indicate when chats are end-to-end encrypted, and it’s available to some beta testers!Some users can get this feature by installing the previous updates.https://t.co/g2i5S7d9R1 pic.twitter.com/KsTa13z0BO While there is definitely value in having the label, WABetaInfo points out: With this enhancement, users are always aware when their chats are securely encrypted using the Signal protocol, serving as a visual confirmation that nobody can read their messages and listen to their calls. It is important to note that this caption disappears after a few seconds so the last seen info can appear. As this is a feature that is currently in beta testing, it is possible -- or even likely -- that it will be tweaked slightly before it rolls out to everyone.

Meta Sues Former Employee Over Alleged Stolen Documents,2024-03-12T08:19:09+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/meta-sues-disloyal-former-vp-over-alleged-stolen-documents,"(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. sued one of its former vice presidents for what it called a “stunning” betrayal in his defection to a “stealth” AI cloud computing startup. Dipinder Singh Khurana, also known as T.S. Khurana, had worked at Meta for 12 years and rose to a senior position at the company as VP of infrastructure, but violated his contract as he was preparing to leave by taking a “trove of proprietary, highly sensitive, confidential, and non-public documents about Meta’s business and employees,” according to the complaint filed Feb. 29 in California state court in Contra Costa County, and which has not been previously reported.  Meta alleges that in “brazenly disloyal” conduct, Khurana uploaded documents related to employee pay and performance, as well as non-public business contracts, to his personal Google Drive and Dropbox accounts just before leaving the company. Meta says at least eight of the employees who were listed on the documents Khurana uploaded then left Meta to go work at Khurana’s new company last year.  “Khurana’s conduct while leaving Meta, and since then, reflects an utter disregard for his contractual and legal obligations,” the lawsuit reads. A Meta spokesperson said the company “takes this kind of egregious misconduct seriously. We will continue working to protect confidential business and employee information.” Khurana did not immediately respond to a LinkedIn message seeking comment.  More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",-2
Meta sues former executive over alleged AI theft,2024-03-12T07:32:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3714344/meta-sues-former-executive-over-alleged-ai-theft.html#tk.rss_all," Meta is suing its former vice president of infrastructure over allegations that he stole proprietary human resources data about the company’s top performers, and key information about its data center supply chain partners to bring to his new employer. In a complaint filed in late February in a California State Court, the software giant alleged that Dipinder Singh Khurana breached contractual agreements, loyalty, and fiduciary duties by taking proprietary, information related to Meta’s data centers, supply chain, as well as employee compensation to a Stealth AI startup where he holds a similar position to what he held at Meta.  “Khurana was given access to proprietary, confidential, non-public, and highly sensitive Meta documents and information that only a limited set of Meta’s employees can access,” according to the complaint. The complaint added that the unauthorized disclosures would hurt competitive advantage, particularly in areas such as AI, data center technology, supply chain operations, and talent retention. The company has accused Khurana of Breach of Contract, Breach of Duty of Loyalty, Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Unjust Enrichment, and violation of California’s Computer Data Access and Fraud Act. Meta has alleged that during his last days as an employee, Khurana leaned on subordinates to give him confidential agreements with suppliers for its data centers. “Unaware of Khurana’s plans, the employee provided Khurana with, among other things, Meta’s pricing-form agreement with that supplier for the computing hardware and the supplier’s Meta-specific preliminary pricing for a particular chip,” the complaint read.  Included in the allegations of documents taken by Khurana is Meta’s “Top Talent” dossier, which includes detailed information about the company’s top performers, including their performance reviews and compensation matrix. “Taken together, the sensitive, confidential, and non-public information in these spreadsheets provides an inside view as to how Meta makes compensation decisions, and also provides key information regarding not just the names of Meta employees but their levels, performance, and skills at Meta,” the complaint read. Meta also alleged in the court document that Khurana prepared a slide deck for his new employer that said, “We do not have the luxury of learning-as-we-go.” Meta said it believes this “mentality likely contributed to Khurana’s wrongful behavior.” Meta is seeking damages, disgorgement of profits unlawfully obtained by Khurana, restitution, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, interest, and other remedies for alleged contract breaches and misuse of proprietary information. The company is demanding a jury trial, and none of the allegations have yet been proven in court. Sam Reynolds is a Taipei-based journalist and contributing writer.",-2

"‘Didn&#039;t get enough sleep, had no hobbies’: Meta CTO on working at Facebook in its early days",2024-03-12T05:59:15+00:00,https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/didnt-get-enough-sleep-had-no-hobbies-meta-cto-on-working-at-facebook-in-its-early-days-421070-2024-03-12?utm_source=rssfeed,"Feedback When ""The Social Network"" hit screens in 2010, it ignited a spark of entrepreneurial ambition in many, painting a picture of the exhilarating journey of startup creation. Yet, a recent interview with Meta's Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, has peeled back the Hollywood glamour, exposing the harsh realities behind the scenes. In a candid discussion on Lenny's Podcast, Bosworth reminisced about his early days at Facebook, where he toiled alongside Zuckerberg and the pioneering team. Far from the glossy portrayal seen in movies, Bosworth revealed the gritty truth of their shared sacrifices and relentless dedication. Describing the intense camaraderie among early Facebook employees, Bosworth disclosed how they lived and breathed the company, often forgoing leisure activities and personal time. He shed light on the gruelling work hours, with 120-hour weeks and minimal sleep becoming the norm. Bosworth's reflections extended to the toll on his well-being, admitting to unhealthy habits and the pressures of constant vigilance against cyber threats. He spoke of the absence of traditional support systems, where solutions were self-derived rather than provided by specialist departments. While Bosworth's journey culminated in success as a tech titan, he cautioned against the romanticised notions of startup culture. Behind the glitz and glam, he warned of the profound sacrifices and uncertainties that define the path to entrepreneurial triumph. Copyright©2024 Living Media India Limited.

Dipinder Singh Khurana, also known as T.S. Khurana, had been at Meta for 12 years, ascending to a senior position as VP of infrastructure. However, Meta alleges that Khurana breached his contract by absconding with a cache of proprietary, highly sensitive, and confidential documents relating to Meta's business operations and personnel. The complaint, filed on February 29 in California state court in Contra Costa County, asserts that Khurana illicitly transferred these documents to his personal Google Drive and Dropbox accounts just prior to his departure from Meta. Meta contends that Khurana's actions were not only disloyal but also had tangible repercussions, as at least eight employees listed on the pilfered documents subsequently left Meta to join Khurana's new venture last year. ""Khurana’s conduct while leaving Meta, and since then, reflects an utter disregard for his contractual and legal obligations,"" the lawsuit states. A spokesperson for Meta told Bloomberg that the company ""takes this kind of egregious misconduct seriously"" and will ""continue working to protect confidential business and employee information.""

Trump calls TikTok a threat but says some kids could ‘go crazy’ without it,2024-03-12T02:42:19+00:00,https://www.bworldonline.com/technology/2024/03/12/581139/trump-calls-tiktok-a-threat-but-says-some-kids-could-go-crazy-without-it/," WASHINGTON – US presidential candidate Donald Trump said on Monday TikTok was a national security threat but also said a ban on the popular app would hurt some kids and only strengthen Meta Platforms’ Facebook, which the Republican has harshly criticized. Mr. Trump reiterated his concerns as lawmakers weigh a bill this week that would give TikTok’s Chinese owner ByteDance about six months to divest the short video app used by 170 million Americans. The US House of Representatives is set to vote on Wednesday under fast-track rules that require two-thirds of members to vote “yes” for the measure to win passage. TikTok told Congress late Monday in a letter seen by Reuters it is “not owned or controlled by the Chinese government” and argued if the company was sold another buyer would not continue TikTok’s $1.5 billion effort to protect US data. “Ironically, US user data could be less secure under a divestment scheme,” the company said. The FBI, Justice Department and Office of the Director of National Intelligence plan to hold on Tuesday a classified briefing for House members, two sources said. FBI Director Chris Wray reiterated concerns about TikTok at a hearing on Monday. The 2024 Annual Threat Assessment of the US Intelligence Community released on Monday said “TikTok accounts run by a PRC propaganda arm reportedly targeted candidates from both political parties during the US midterm election cycle in 2022.” The Justice Department detailed its security concerns about TikTok in a document last week first reported by Reuters. “I’m not looking to make Facebook double the size,” Mr. Trump told CNBC on Monday. “And if you if you ban TikTok, (then) Facebook and others, but mostly Facebook, will be a big beneficiary. And I think Facebook has been very dishonest.” Mr. Trump met recently with investor Jeff Yass, whose investment firm Susquehanna International Group has a stake in ByteDance, he confirmed on CNBC. Trump said they did not talk about TikTok. Meta Platforms shares closed down 4.4% at $483.59 on Monday. The company declined to comment.   ‘KIDS WILL GO CRAZY’ Mr. Trump previously criticized the company now called Meta Platforms for revoking his access to Facebook and Instagram after removing two of his posts during the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot. His accounts were reinstated in February 2023. Mr. Trump also said a TikTok ban could impact young people. “There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,” he said. “There’s a lot of good and there’s a lot of bad with TikTok.” Tiktok CEO Shou Zi Chew will visit Capitol Hill later this week on a previously scheduled trip to talk to senators, a source briefed on the matter said. President Joe Biden said last week he would sign the bill after a committee unanimously approved the measure. TikTok, which says it has not and would not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government, argues the House bill amounts to a ban. It is unclear if China would approve any sale or if TikTok ...",-2

Meta Execs Discuss How Its Content Moderators Are Preparing for 2024 Election,2024-03-11T21:54:50+00:00,https://observer.com/2024/03/meta-exec-social-media-content-moderation-2024-election/,"The 2024 Presidential election season has kicked into high gear, and it’s a big moment for social media content moderators. The internet is becoming more personal and stratified for its users, and algorithms are only getting better at delivering information that most resonates with each person individually, regardless if it’s good, bad or simply untrue.

Content moderators for major social platforms Meta (META)’s Facebook and Instagram are tasked with keeping the spread of misinformation at bay, but they often are dealing with issues as they come. Because of this, they haven’t been able to prevent some historical civil unrests, such as political insurrections, that were built on false information largely distributed through social media platforms.   During a panel discussion on the future of online content moderation at SXSW yesterday (March 10), Ronaldo Lemos, a member of Meta’s oversight board, an independent advisory body, spoke about how the consequences played out in his home country of Brazil. Similar to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, where around 10,000 supporters of former President Donald Trump marched on the Capitol grounds out of false belief that the 2020 Presidential election was stolen, thousands of Brazilian supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro stormed their government building for the same reason in 2023.     “It was a failure on the part of moderation because that content stayed up. It should have been taken down because it’s clearly incitement for a violent action,” Lemos said. “The case was escalated to the oversight board, and we immediately not only decided to take the content down, but we made some very important recommendations to Meta in regards of how we should approach this extremely important year for democracy.”  Also on the panel were Maxime Prades, Meta’s director of product for integrity, and Brittan Heller, a cyber policy expert and Stanford University lecturer. The panel was moderated by Charlotte Willner, executive director of the Trust and Safety Professional Association.  Prades said Meta has been working on its election-year strategy by using a policy forum to update users on its efforts. Specifically, the company has been using third-party fact checkers and consulting with non-government organizations and a separate organization of independent “trusted partners.” “We need to have this pulse-on-the-ground movement within hours sometimes,” Prades said. “So we work with all these organizations and external bodies to get that pulse of how things are going and what we should be changing in our enforcement, in our policies.” Lemos said Meta should be looking for a c...",-2
Trump calls Facebook the enemy of the people. Meta's stock sinks,2024-03-11T20:50:12+00:00,https://www.wral.com/story/trump-calls-facebook-the-enemy-of-the-people-meta-s-stock-sinks/21323424/,"New York (CNN) — Facebook once again finds itself in the crosshairs of former President Donald Trump. And that’s making some traders on Wall Street nervous.Meta Platforms (META), the owner of Facebook and one of the stars of the recent market rally, fell about 4% on Monday after Trump called into CNBC and labeled Facebook “an enemy of the people.”Meta shares also retreated 1.2% on Friday following a post by Trump on Truth Social where the former president blasted Facebook as “a true Enemy of the People!”Meta’s market valuation has dropped by more than $60 billion since Trump’s attacks began Thursday evening.No major news appeared to drive the Meta selloff, other than the condemnation from the former – and possibly future – president of the United States.“It has everything to do with the comments from former President Trump,” Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, told CNN. “Facebook has gone through waves of being dragged into the political debate – and it never bodes well for them.”Trump surprised many last week by reversing his stance on TikTok and coming out against the TikTok ban that many in Congress – including many Republicans – are pushing for.Why? Well, Trump argues that banning TikTok would help Facebook, a company the former president has a long history of battling with.“The thing I don’t like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media,” Trump told CNBC Monday morning before US markets opened.Facebook imposed a two-year ban on Trump in the wake of the Jan 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Meta reinstated Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in February 2023.“I think Facebook has been very dishonest. I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections,” Trump said.Meta did not respond to a request for comment.Investors are clearly taking notice of the attacks from Trump. At one point, Meta shares were down about 5% Monday, leaving them on track for the worst day since December 2022.Luria, the D.A. Davidson analyst, said Trump’s comments raise concerns about Facebook becoming a target of Washington once again.“When a presidential candidate refers to them as the enemy of the people, that really brings them back into the center of the debate – where they haven’t been for a few years,” Luria said.Specifically, Luria said Trump, if elected president, could pressure Facebook by making it harder for Meta to make acquisitions in the future. The company’s prior acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp have been central to its growth.“If it can’t buy the next great thing in the future, it will have trouble competing,” Luria said. “There are pretty impactful things a president can do, not to mention using the power of the podium to limit a company’s attractiveness to a certain voter base.”Of course, Trump himself is very much involved in social media.US regulators recently gave the green light to a controversial merger betwee...",0
Trump Calls Facebook an 'Enemy of the People' For No Particular Reason,2024-03-11T18:44:48+00:00,https://sfist.com/2024/03/11/trump-calls-facebook-an-enemy-of-the-people-for-no-particular-reason/,"Donald Trump is attacking Facebook again for no particular reason, calling it an ""enemy of the people"" and sending Meta's stock price tumbling. Trump spent part of his Monday morning calling in to CNBC to talk about TikTok, and why he disagrees with a bill in Congress that would ban TikTok, saying the app poses a national security risk due to Chinese government ties. But Trump isn't so concerned with TikTok as he is with Facebook, probably because Facebook banned him for two years following January 6th. “The thing I don’t like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media,” Trump said in his CNBC call. Trump added, ""I think Facebook has been very dishonest. I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections."" The call happened before markets opened Monday morning, and subsequently, Meta shares fell 4%, and at one point were trading down 5%. As for TikTok, Trump said ""there’s a lot of good and there’s a lot of bad"" on the platform. “There are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it,"" he said. Both Twitter and Facebook suspended Trump's accounts on the grounds that he incited a violent insurrection on January 6th, and used both platforms to celebrate that violence and spread the lie that he won the 2020 election. Twitter's ban on Trump was indefinite, however after Elon Musk took the company over in 2022 he reinstated Trump's account along with those of other alt-right and fringe personalities who had been suspended for various reasons. (And, late last year, Musk also reinstated the account of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, despite years of his damaging lies about the Sandy Hook massacre.) Facebook's Oversight Board ruled that indefinite bans were wrong, and the company ultimately decided to suspend Trump's account for two years — or until he no longer posed ""a threat to public safety,"" which, arguably, he still does. Trump got his accounts back by early 2023, but he hasn't been back on Twitter, opting instead to ""tweet"" on Truth Social, though his audience there was never as large as his Twitter following. He, or members of his campaign, have been fairly active on Facebook, though, posting videos from his live appearances and putting out calls for volunteers. He still seems to have a grudge against the company, though, and he'd likely do his best to make life difficult for Meta if he were to become president again. Meta, so far, has not commented on Trump's remarks.

Trump calls Facebook ‘enemy of the people.’ Meta stock sinks,2024-03-11T18:00:59+00:00,https://www.siliconvalley.com/2024/03/11/trump-calls-facebook-enemy-of-the-people-meta-stock-sinks/,"Today's E-Edition Morning Report in your inbox!  Morning Report in your inbox! Today's E-Edition By Matt Egan | CNN Facebook once again finds itself in the crosshairs of former President Donald Trump. And that’s making some traders on Wall Street nervous. Meta Platforms (META), the owner of Facebook and one of the stars of the recent market rally, fell about 4% on Monday after Trump called into CNBC and labeled Facebook “an enemy of the people.” Meta shares also retreated 1.2% on Friday following a post by Trump on Truth Social where the former president blasted Facebook as “a true Enemy of the People!” Meta’s market valuation has dropped by more than $60 billion since Trump’s attacks began Thursday evening. No major news appeared to drive the Meta selloff, other than the condemnation from the former – and possibly future – president of the United States. “It has everything to do with the comments from former President Trump,” Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, told CNN. “Facebook has gone through waves of being dragged into the political debate – and it never bodes well for them.” Trump surprised many last week by reversing his stance on TikTok and coming out against the TikTok ban that many in Congress – including many Republicans – are pushing for. Why? Well, Trump argues that banning TikTok would help Facebook, a company the former president has a long history of battling with. “The thing I don’t like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people, along with a lot of the media,” Trump told CNBC Monday morning before US markets opened. Facebook imposed a two-year ban on Trump in the wake of the Jan 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Meta reinstated Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts in February 2023. “I think Facebook has been very dishonest. I think Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections,” Trump said. Meta did not respond to a request for comment. Investors are clearly taking notice of the attacks from Trump. At one point, Meta shares were down about 5% Monday, leaving them on track for the worst day since December 2022. Luria, the D.A. Davidson analyst, said Trump’s comments raise concerns about Facebook becoming a target of Washington once again. “When a presidential candidate refers to them as the enemy of the people, that really brings them back into the center of the debate – where they haven’t been for a few years,” Luria said. Specifically, Luria said Trump, if elected president, could pressure Facebook by making it harder for Meta to make acquisitions in the future. The company’s prior acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp have been central to its growth. “If it can’t buy the next great thing in the future, it will have trouble competing,” Luria said. “There are pretty impactful things a president can do, not to mention using the power of the podium to limit a company’s attractiveness to a certain voter base.” Of course, Trump himsel...",-3

Facebook and Instagram owner Meta’s decision to opt out of commercial deals with Australian news publishers has prompted an “existential moment” for media companies, says Nine chairman Peter Costello, former head of the Future Fund. Making the comments at The Australian Financial Review’s business summit in Sydney on Monday, Costello said Meta’s decision to pull almost $70 million in annual revenue for news organisations would put reputable journalism at risk. Nine chairman Peter Costello said Meta should be subject to improved government regulation.Credit: Peter Rae “If our media goes the way of everybody being drawn on platforms with free unedited content, then you won’t have anyone investing in reputable media,” he said. “This is quite an existential moment for Australian media.” Costello was also federal treasurer between 1996 and 2007. He recently stood down as chair of the Future Fund after 10 years. He has been chair of Nine, the owner of this masthead, since 2016. Costello said the $1.8 trillion tech giant’s monopoly position needed to be subject to improved government regulation, but that it was in Meta’s interests to continue to support reputable journalism in Australia. Responding to the comments, a Meta spokesperson said, “it doesn’t make sense to invest in areas that don’t align with consumer preferences”, pointing to its own reports that users do not use the platform for news. Publishers could continue to use its free services, they added. Despite Meta’s plans to shift resources away from its news functions, the spokesperson said the platform was retaining its ongoing commitment to keep misinformation and harmful content off its services. Meta announced at the start of this month that it would not renegotiate its 13 commercial deals it signed with publishers in 2021 as part of the news media bargaining code when they expire this year, a decision prompting criticism from the industry and politicians. The code was created to address the perceived power imbalance between US tech giants and Australian news organisations. Nine is among those to have a commercial deal with Meta, alongside Guardian Australia, the ABC, Seven West Media, News Corp, Network 10, Australian Community Media and others. About two-thirds of the $200 million in revenue provided to media companies under the code is covered by Google. Meta said its decision was a response to how people were using its services — news now accounted for less than 3 per cent of what users saw in their Facebook feeds.

Joe Biden has said he would sign legislation banning popular video-sharing app TikTok in the United States. Legislation passed through the US House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously on Thursday calling on China’s ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or effectively face a US ban. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, who supports the bill, has indicated it will soon come up for a full vote in the House. Sky News  Britain’s hard-pressed carers need all the help they can get. But that should not include using unregulated AI bots, according to researchers who say the AI revolution in social care needs a hard ethical edge. A pilot study by academics at the University of Oxford found some care providers had been using generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Bard to create care plans for people receiving care. That presents a potential risk to patient confidentiality, according to Dr Caroline Green, an early career research fellow at the Institute for Ethics in AI at Oxford, who surveyed care organisations for the study. The Guardian  Craig Phillips, former winner of the reality TV show Big Brother, has described his fear when the brakes failed on his Jaguar I-Pace electric vehicle while he was driving. It is the second report of the brakes failing on this particular model while in motion. Mr Phillips said it was “terrifying” to feel “out of control” of the vehicle while his family were also inside. Jaguar said it was investigating and took both claims seriously. Earlier this week, another I-Pace driver claimed to have found himself unable to brake on a motorway as the car accelerated and had to be flanked by police. BBC  Massive discounts and plenty of incentives will be offered by manufacturers desperate to shift their EV stocks and avoid being fined. That’s the view of former UK CEO and president of Hyundai Tony Whitehorn, who said the ball had already started rolling with a financial deposit allowance of up to £8,000 on one volume-selling vehicle alone as UK car brands try to speed up the switch to electric. Whitehorn said EV manufacturers operating in the UK faced hefty fines under the ZEV mandate if they failed to hit certain targets. Car Dealer Shortly after Apple terminated Epic Games’ developer account, the EU Commission launched a probe against the Cupertino-based company to see if there’s any violation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). And a swift decision followed. In an X post, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said that Apple will be reinstating the European developer account after the EU Commission enforced the DMA. The X post even suggests that the EU’s decision paves the way for an Epic Games Store on iOS in Europe. This has been a long-standing dispute between Apple and Epic Games, as the former does not allow third-party app stores on its platform, which directly violates EU’s Digital Markets Act.    The DMA went through its first major challenge with Apple banning Epic Games Sweden from competing with the App Store, and ...",0

"Meta, Microsoft, X and Match Group come out swinging against Apple's third-party payment rules",2024-03-20T20:07:05+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/meta-microsoft-x-and-match-group-come-out-swinging-against-apples-third-party-payment-rules-200705867.html?src=rss,"Several notable names have joined Epic Games in taking a stance against Apple's decision to charge a fee for iOS payments made outside of the App Store. Meta, Microsoft, X and Match Group filed an amicus brief in the case, as The Wall Street Journal reports. That lends some heavyweight backing to Epic's cause. Apple was forced to enable third-party payments on iOS due to the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and a court ruling in the US. It also has to allow alternative app marketplaces on iOS in the EU. The company takes up to a 30 percent cut of App Store purchases. Perhaps fearing that it was about to lose out on a significant chunk of commission, Apple said it would charge a fee of up to 27 percent when developers process purchases outside of the App Store. Epic this month filed a petition asking District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to enforce a permanent injunction she issued against Apple in 2021 as part of her ruling in the case between the two companies. The decision compelled Apple to allow developers to direct users to alternative payment systems. Most of Rogers' ruling was in Apple's favor, however, and both companies appealed the decision all the way up to the Supreme Court. However, in January, the highest court in the US declined to hear the appeals. That means Rogers' permanent injunction against Apple stood, but Epic was not happy about the way Apple implemented the third-party payment changes. The four companies supporting Epic's petition claim that the fee Apple is charging on external payments effectively leaves the previous rules in place. ""The Apple Plan comports with neither the letter nor the spirit of this Court's mandate,"" their brief states. As X put it, the 27 percent fee doesn't give developers much incentive to link to external payment methods. Microsoft, which has been working on its own mobile game store, noted that Apple's latest policy limits its ability to offer users subscriptions and discounts. Match Group argued that Apple's decision will affect many developers and users, and that it stymies the court's attempt to offer consumers competition on pricing. Meta, meanwhile, charges more for its ad-free plans and boosted posts on its iOS apps than it does on the web. (The ad-free subscription is also more expensive in the company's Android apps, as Google takes a cut of in-app payments too). Meta states in the amicus brief that it ought to be able to direct users to other payment options for boosted posts. Apple claims to have complied with the court order. According to the Journal, the company (which is reportedly facing a Justice Department antitrust case) says its current external link policies are important to protect user privacy and security. Apple has also been dinged over its compliance with the DMA, with critics suggesting the company might be adhering to the letter of the law, but not its spirit. For what it's worth, Meta, Microsoft, X and Match Group filed their petition one day after the EU's ...",-1

EU signals doubts over legality of Meta’s privacy fee,2024-03-20T18:44:52+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/20/meta-privacy-fee-eu-assessment/,"The European Union has given its strongest signal yet that a controversial tactic rolled out by Meta last November to extract consent to tracking from regional users of Facebook and Instagram — by forcing them to choose between paying a monthly subscription or agree to tracking — won’t wash under the bloc’s updated digital governance and competition rules. On Tuesday, digital EVP and competition chief Margrethe Vestager cast doubt on Meta’s privacy fee, telling Reuters: “I think there are many different ways to monetize the services that you provide. Because one thing are the very targeted advertising that builds on data being consumed. Another way of showing your advertising is to make that contextual. So I think it’s important to continue the conversation with Meta and we will assess also finally, what is the next push in order for them to be compliant with the DMA [Digital Markets Act].” In wider remarks to the news agency — discussing a new fee Apple announced in response to the DMA — she also said: “There are things that we take a keen interest in, for instance, if the new Apple fee structure will de facto not make it in any way attractive to use the benefits of the DMA. That kind of thing is what we will be investigating.” The comments suggest the Commission is paying careful attention to any attempts by gatekeepers to use economic coercion as a tactic to circumvent the intended impact of the bloc’s digital rules. Or, in other words, that tech giants are going to need to abide by both the letter and the spirit of the law. The EU’s goal for the DMA is to loosen Big Tech’s grip on tipped digital markets and stamp out unfair tactics that flow from their ability to throw their weight around when it comes to imposing their own rules on other businesses and consumers. Europe’s DMA rules for Big Tech explained  Meta was designated a gatekeeper under the DMA last September, with the EU listing several so-called core platform services — including its ads business and aforementioned social networks — falling in scope of ex ante competition rules that include limitations on the use of people’s data for ads. The Commission itself is responsible for enforcing this rulebook on gatekeepers. Meta is also subject to the bloc’s Digital Services Act (DSA), an updated approach to online governance that includes a subset of extra rules for very large online platforms (VLOPs). Meta’s social networks, Facebook and Instagram, are both designated. And the Commission oversees Meta’s compliance with the DSA’s rules for VLOPs, too. Both the DSA and the DMA demand in-scope platforms obtain consent for ads processing. Whereas Meta stands accused — by privacy rights campaigners, consumer protection organizations and some EU lawmakers — of using unfair tactics and economic coercion to force Europeans to hand over their data. While the Commission didn’t appear to take much note when Meta switched on its controversial paywall last fall, it has clocked the growing outrage by...",-3
"Apple isn’t living up to the letter or spirit of court order in Epic suit, Meta and Microsoft say",2024-03-20T18:02:22+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106838/apple-epic-anti-steering-developers-in-app-payments-meta-microsoft-match,"By  Lauren Feiner, the senior policy reporter at The Verge, covering the intersection of Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill. She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform. Apple is not living up to the letter or spirit of an order issued by a California federal judge in its trial against Epic Games. That’s what Meta, Microsoft, Match Group, and X told the court in an amicus brief on Wednesday. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers told Apple in 2021 that it could not prevent app developers from using “buttons, external links, or other calls to action” informing users of payment options outside of their apps. Epic and other developers have taken issue with Apple’s 15 to 30 percent fees on in-app purchases, which Apple makes difficult to avoid by also preventing them from directing users to payment options at a lower price outside of the iOS ecosystem. Apple has defended the fees as reasonable compensation for its own services on the App Store. But the companies that filed the brief Wednesday, all of which say they’ve been subject to Apple’s rules against steering users away from its own payment processing, say Apple’s idea of compliance would not fix the problem. Its proposal to let developers point to an external purchase link is complex and burdensome, the companies say.  “Apple’s new restrictions are plainly designed to render alternatives to Apple’s IAP impractical for developers, and inaccessible and unappealing to consumers, thus circumventing both the spirit and underlying goals of the injunction,” the companies wrote in their brief.  Epic itself has asked the judge to enforce her original order, saying that Apple is in “blatant violation” of the injunction. But it’s notable that other large developers, like Meta and Microsoft, have decided to weigh in now and shows that Apple’s rules can impact even the largest of tech companies. The amici say that Apple’s 12 to 27 percent fee on external purchases defeats the purpose of the new requirement since it’s only a few percentage points below what developers would otherwise be required to pay for in-app purchases. The external purchase fee could make it unrealistic for developers to even set up an external payments system, given that other transaction costs they might incur through that route could eliminate any of the 3 percent gains they’d get from moving away from Apple’s system. Plus, customers are unlikely to choose the external option if it’s the same price or higher. The companies explain how Apple’s in-app payment requirements impact them and allegedly harm them and their users. Meta, for example, says that Apple decided in 2022 to require Meta to pay the IAP fee for its product that lets advertisers boost posts within their apps to reach more users. Meta says this change increases the costs of using the feature, which would not be the case if Meta could steer users to its own payment options. When asked for comment on the amicus brief...",-2

Facebook, Instagram and Messenger were down Wednesday, with nearly two thousand users worldwide reporting that they couldn’t log in to the popular social media platforms, according to DownDetector. Reports that the Meta-owned sites began to spike around 10 am ET and quickly snowballed, DownDetector reported. The tracking site showed that 70% of the roughly 1,700 who reported an outage couldn’t log in to the apps, while 22% had trouble accessing the websites. Another 8% were having log-in issues. The Post has sought comment from Meta. Meta users also took to rival platform X to report the outages and ask if others were experiencing the same issues. This is the second time in just over two weeks that Meta’s widely used social media platforms have suffered outages. A technical issue caused widespread login issues for a few hours across Meta’s Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and Messenger platforms on March 5. Andy Stone, Meta’s head of communications, acknowledged the issues on X, formerly known as Twitter, and said the company “resolved the issue as quickly as possible for everyone who was impacted, and we apologize for any inconvenience.” Users reported being locked out of their Facebook accounts and feeds on the platform as well as Threads and Instagram were not refreshing. A senior official with the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told reporters that the agency was “not aware of any specific election nexus nor any specific malicious cyber activity nexus to the outage.” This is a developing story.",-2

"The AI Assembly Line Ends With Microsoft, Google And Meta",2024-03-20T14:37:16+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/bloomberg/inflection-takeover-the-ai-assembly-line-ends-with-microsoft-google-and-meta,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It’s almost impossible for an artificial-intelligence startup to build anything as good as ChatGPT, but Inflection was getting there.  Last year the Palo Alto, California-based firm raised $1.3 billion in a single fundraising round to turn its chatbot Pi into a personal assistant for everything. It built up a phenomenal cache of computing power, gaining access to thousands of coveted graphics-processing unit chips from Nvidia Corp. and was on track to surpass OpenAI’s free version of ChatGPT with a model it had built, remarkably, . Compared to most startups, Inflection’s path to success looked smooth. So it came as a shock to the industry on Tuesday when Inflection announced that its co-founders Mustafa Suleyman and Karén Simonyan, along with most of its employees, were joining investor Microsoft Corp. as employees, and that Suleyman would lead the software giant’s consumer AI business.  What happened? Had Inflection run out of all that money in less than a year? If large portions of the funding were in cloud credits, perhaps it had, and those credits can now flow back to Microsoft. Suleyman also told Bloomberg last year that Inflection lacked a business model. But plenty of tech startups have coasted on venture capital dollars for years before being able to open the revenue spigots. That Inflection has been swallowed so quickly by Microsoft underscores a stark new reality: With AI, legacy tech companies are sucking the innovation out of the room like a giant squid and more rapidly than with previous waves of technology. And they’re doing it right under the noses of regulators.    Requirements around computing power and talent have made it too expensive for most companies to build cutting-edge generative AI models without the patronage of a tech giant like Microsoft, Google or Meta Platforms Inc. Case in point: Apple is thinking of outsourcing its generative AI efforts to Google. Until now, Microsoft’s strategy seemed to be one of hedging its bets. It made a major investment in OpenAI, but it also invested in hot AI rivals including Inflection and Mistral. Now, it’s starting to adopt the Mark Zuckerberg School of Competition playbook, blasting smaller contenders out of existence so they’re no longer a threat, and pulling their talent into its orbit as it’s now doing with Inflection.  That may have been the plan all along for Inflection, whose other co-founder is Reid Hoffman, the billionaire who sold LinkedIn to Microsoft and then joined the software giant’s board. Hoffman went on to broker the meetings that led to Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI, so he may well have been pivotal to the Inflection deal. (The night before Tuesday’s announcement, I happened to spot Hoffman walking out of an AI conference in Paris and into a private meeting with Kevin Scott, Microsoft’s chief technology officer.) Hiring Inflection’s staff, rather than buying the company outright, is a clever sleight of hand by Microsoft in the face of rising ...",-2

What’ll happen when Facebook stops paying for news? Here’s what happened when radio stopped paying for music,2024-03-20T03:44:44+00:00,https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/03/20/facebook-meta-australia-news-publishing-deal-radio/,"Support independent journalism Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au The news media bargaining code allows the government to force Meta to pay, but only if it continues to link to news. It's given every indication it won’t. Peter Martin Mar 20, 2024  7 Why are musicians so keen to get played on the radio? It can’t be because of the money. In Australia they are paid at rates so low they come close to making streaming services look generous. By law, no radio station can be made to pay more than 1% of the station’s gross revenue for all of the music it plays, even if it is an all-music station. By the time the labels have had their cut, the artists get a lot less. Legislation now before the Senate would remove the ceiling, allowing radio stations and the representatives of musical artists to negotiate freely, with a final decision made by a tribunal in cases where they can’t reach agreement. It’s a bit like the legislation set up to arbitrate disputes between platforms such as Facebook and news organisations about the amount to pay for news. The parallels tell us an awful lot about where the power lies in disputes between platforms and providers. Here’s a hint: it doesn’t lie with providers, whether they provide music, or news, or, for that matter, fruit to Coles and Woolworths. Here’s what happened with radio. Legislation dating back to 1968 has given Australian radio stations a blanket right to play whatever music they want so long as they negotiate a payment rate with the relevant collecting society. If the station and collecting society can’t agree on the rate, the decision is made by an independent tribunal, but, for commercial stations, the tribunal is limited to awarding no more than 1% of the station’s gross revenue, and for ABC stations, a mere half of one cent per Australian resident per year. The attorney-general introduced the ceilings to “allay the fears” of radio stations and initially promised a review after five years, a provision he later dropped from the final draft of the legislation. A half a century of inflation has rendered the ABC’s ceiling of half a cent per person worth a fraction of what it was. The ceilings only apply to radio stations and only to the recordings. Television stations (including ABC stations) pay much more per track. And composers, who are paid separately with no legislated limit, get much more. This means the composers of “You’re the Voice” get paid quite well, but the performer, John Farnham, does not. The record industry has tried time and time again to remove the ceiling. In 2010 it even went to the High Court, arguing along the lines of the case depicted in the movie The Castle that the constitution prevented the Commonwealth from acquiring property other than “on just terms”. The High Court said “no”, finding copyright wasn’t property. Now, independent Senator David Pocock is trying again. Pocock’s Fair Pay for Radio Play Bill would remove the ceilings, allowing the radio industry and the record industr...",0
Personal carbon emissions by the numbers (Sustainability Spotlight),2024-03-20T01:00:00+00:00,https://www.castanet.net/news/Sustainability-Spotlight/477669/Personal-carbon-emissions-by-the-numbers,"Are you interested in reducing your personal carbon footprint? Have you ever wondered exactly how much recycling reduces global warming? In 2020, a meta-analysis paper was published by Diana Ivanova and her co-authors who reviewed studies covering a range of personal consumption options. The researchers started with a dataset of 6,990 studies from all over the world and used machine learning to winnow this down to the most relevant 53 studies. The meta-analysis is great for two reasons—it gives a reliable average and it shows the uncertainty. The data from the study is publicly available and I focused on two baskets, one with transportation choices and a second with common household actions like recycling. Let’s look first at transportation options. The amount of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) saved is measured in tonnes per person per year. Living car-free saves 2.1 tonnes of CO2e per person per year. (The average Canadian footprint is 15.2 tonnes of CO2e per person per year.) Driving a battery operated vehicle (BEV) saves two tonnes of CO2e per person per year. In the global study, shifting to a smaller car generates a savings of 0.42, but I suspect that would be much greater in Canada where we drive the heaviest fleet in the world because we buy so many large pickup trucks. Actions cause “backfire” or “rebound,” where a measure which is supposed to reduce carbon emissions actually increases them. You will notice this rebound effect in Figure 1 for “Shift to plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV)/hybrid electric vehicles (HEV)” and Figure 2 “Produce renewable energy.”  Some of the error bars are large. Should we be surprised at the size of error bars for BEVs or for installing renewable energy on your house? In both those cases, the amount of carbon you can save depends on how clean your electricity mix is. Provinces with high-carbon electricity include Alberta, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia. The Canadian Energy Regulator reports those provinces make about 85% of their electricity from fossil fuels. A really dirty electricity mix reduces the advantage of driving a BEV, but gives solar panels on your home a large positive impact. The authors commented in the paper the “electricity mix alone was found to explain almost 70% of the variability.” If you are interested in solar panels or buying a BEV, you may be better off using an online calculator that factors in your local electricity mix.  People are often surprised that reducing or recycling stuff doesn’t reduce their carbon emissions by very much. Here, less packaging, fewer purchases, less plastic, recycle and less paper each have an impact of less than 0.2 tonnes of CO2e, approximately 1% of your total footprint. I do these things because they are sustainable (better for the planet) not because they reduce my overall carbon emission. I also expect better recycling technology will also increase the carbon savings.  As a numbers geek, I think this study is awesome. Having accurate numbers all...",0

Threads kicks off 'Trending Now' feed in the US - here's how to access it,2024-03-19T19:34:04+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/threads-kicks-off-trending-now-feed-in-the-us-heres-how-to-access-it/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular Threads has finally launched another feature that users have been requesting, namely a Trending Now feed. Available in the US, Trending Now displays the hottest topics being discussed on Threads on any given day. The goal is to encourage people to learn about and chime in on popular and relevant subjects. ""Trending now is rolling out to the US today so you can see what people are talking about on Threads,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post on Threads. Also: I tried replacing Twitter with Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon: What I found Those of you in the US can access the Trending Now feed via the Threads website and the mobile app for iOS or Android. Either way, select the Search magnifying glass icon. The Trending Now topics appear at the top. Tap or click a specific topic to view the latest posts about it. For its debut on Tuesday, the Trending Topics feed highlighted five subjects, including the day's Spring equinox, Aaron Taylor-Johnson reportedly being picked as the next James Bond, Netflix unveiling a new sports series, the latest legal woes of Trump lawyer Alina Habba, and Trump suing ABC and George Stephanopoulos for allegedly defaming him in an interview with South Carolina representative Nancy Mace. The Trending Topics is one feature that certain other social networks already offer.  X, aka Twitter, provides a list of trending topics in its Explore section. To catch up with the likes of X, Threads started testing top topics in the US last month. Zuckerberg has also promised that it would reach other countries and languages once the feature is up and running. Also: 5 reasons to try Twitter rival Bluesky (no invite needed) In his own post on Threads, Instagram head Adam Mosseri said that the trending topics will be accessible from the search page and the For You feed. To generate the feed, Threads taps into AI to learn what subjects people are discussing on the platform, according to Mosseri. But the topics are also reviewed by plain, old-fashioned human beings. ""Our content specialists will review the topics selected by our AI systems to make sure they're not duplicative or confusing, but by and large, we want them to accurately represent what is actually topical on Threads,"" Mosseri said, adding that political trends are eligible for the list.",2
"Threads Adds 'Trending' Page, Moving Ever Closer to Old Twitter",2024-03-19T19:22:26+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/threads-finally-adds-trending-now-page-1851348822,"Threads users in the United States will finally be able to see what topics are trending on the app, a longheld staple feature of Twitter, according to a post from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday. The “Trending Now” page appears under the search bar on Threads. “Trending now is rolling out to the US today so you can see what people are talking about on Threads,” said Mark Zuckerberg in a post on Threads. Trending now is rolling out to the US today so you can see what people are talking about on… Meta tested a trending page on Threads earlier this year called “Today’s Topics.” It appears the company shifted the name of the page to a more familiar name. The “Trending” page has been a staple of Twitter, Threads’ competitor, for years and it’s been highly cited as a missing feature of the Threads platform. The topics trending on Threads “trending now” page on its first day of launch were: Aaron Taylor Johnson, spring equinox, Bruce Willis’ birthday, Hong Kong security law, and former president Donald Trump’s attorney, Alina Habba. The page appears to link to the most popular topics on the platform of the day.  Meta launched Threads last summer, and it blew up in popularity with 49 million users in the first two days. Then all the hype faded away as many of those millions of people who signed up for the platform when it was first released just stopped using it. Since then, Meta continued to add new features such as a web browser version, a retweet-like feature called reposts, and even an edit button. These new features have made Threads a popular app once again, and Meta said last month that there are more users now than at launch.  Two relatively political topics, Trump’s attorney and Hong Kong security law, were trending on the first day of Threads’ “trending now” feature. Politics are trending despite Meta’s firm stance that Threads is not the place for it. Meta says it will not proactively boost political content on Threads, though the company claims it also will not demote it. The social media app is still missing a few key features that would make it just like Twitter. There are hashtags on Threads, but they don’t work as well as they do on Twitter and other platforms making it difficult to find everything about a certain topic. Threads also has yet to integrate DMs into the platform. However, Meta seems to be updating the app to make it more like Twitter every couple of weeks.",2

Meta is finally rolling out trending topics on Threads,2024-03-19T18:43:11+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-finally-rolling-out-trending-topics-on-threads-184311138.html?src=rss,"Meta is finally providing a bit of visibility into what kinds of conversations are happening on its Twitter competitor, Threads. The service is rolling out its “trending now” feature to all US users, Mark Zuckerberg said in a post. The feature, which the company began testing in February, uses AI to surface a handful of topics “based on what people are engaging with right now.” Trends will appear in Threads’ search page and will also appear in between posts in users’ For You feeds. For now, the feature is still fairly limited. Threads only shows five trending topics at any one time, which is likely an attempt to keep the list relatively curated and avoid some of the issues that have plagued the feature on Twitter and now X. Meta has said it employs human “content specialists” to review topics and ensure that trends comply with the company’s safety rules. Still, the official arrival of trends brings a much-requested feature to the app. Up until now, users had very few ways to get insight into what others are talking about outside of what they can see in their own feeds. Trends also gives users a way to keep up with some news and current events on the platform, despite Meta’s reluctance to “encourage” news content on Threads.

Meta offers to lower ad-free subscription fees in the EU,2024-03-19T16:52:39+00:00,https://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/meta-eu-ad-free-subscription-plan-price-drop-facebook-instagram,"

19 Mar 2024  Image: © kovop58/Stock.adobe.com A Meta lawyer told the Commission today that it can lower its EU subscription fees to €5.99 for a single account and charge €4 for every additional account. Meta has offered to lower the price of its ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in the EU market. In a hearing with the European Commission today (19 March), the company said that it can bring the fees for the ad-free tier in the EU from €9.99 to €5.99, according to Reuters. Meta first shared plans to introduce an ad-free paid tier for Instagram and Facebook in the EU in October last year to address EU privacy concerns without taking a hit financially. However, the move – which would give EU users a choice between ad-enabled free services and ad-free premium services – was not well received by privacy rights activists. Max Schrems, the privacy rights advocate who set up the non-profit NYOB (None of Your Business), said in a statement at the time that fundamental rights “cannot be for sale”. “Are we going to pay for the right to vote or the right to free speech next? This would mean that only the rich can enjoy these rights, at a time when many people are struggling to make ends meet,” he said. “Introducing this idea in the area of your right to data protection is a major shift. We would fight this up and down the courts.” Meta lawyer Tim Lamb told the hearing today that the price drop applies to a single account and EU users will be charged €4 for any additional accounts. “That is by far the lowest end of the range that any reasonable person should be paying for services of this quality. And I think that is a serious offer. The regulatory uncertainty at the moment is out there and it needs to settle down quickly.” NOYB said in October that the move by Meta followed successful litigation by the non-profit in which the European Data Protection Board and the Court of Justice of the European Union declared the tech giant’s so-called “consent bypass” practices illegal. Just last month, this ‘consent-or-pay’ model was under fresh fire from eight consumer groups from the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) network, which filed complaints with their national data protection authorities against Meta, including in Spain, France, Denmark and Greece. Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of BEUC, said at the time the new model is Meta’s latest effort to justify “massive commercial surveillance” on its users. “Meta’s offer to consumers is smoke and mirrors to cover up what is, at its core, the same old hoovering up of all kinds of sensitive information about people’s lives which it then monetises through its invasive advertising model,” she said. “Surveillance-based business models pose all kinds of problems under the GDPR and it’s time for data protection authorities to stop Meta’s unfair data processing and its infringing of people’s fundamental rights.” Find out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our n...",-2

"Meta To Operationalise Elections Centre; To Curb Misinformation, Misuse Of AI-Made Content",2024-03-19T14:45:02+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/meta-to-operationalise-elections-centre-to-curb-misinformation-misuse-of-ai-made-content,"Facebook and Instagram-owner Meta on Tuesday vowed to crack down on any misinformation and misuse of AI-generated content during general elections in India, saying it will remove them if they suppress voting, incite violence and use a network of fact-checkers to label content that is fake, altered or manipulated. Meta said it will operationalise an India-specific Elections Operations Centre, bringing together experts from across the organisation to identify potential threats and put specific mitigations in place across its apps and technologies in real-time. The social media giant said it is building tools to label AI-generated images from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, and others that users post to Facebook, Instagram and Threads, as the social media giant pledged its commitment towards election integrity efforts ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. The general election is scheduled to be held in seven phases starting from Apr. 19, and results will be declared on June 4. Meta said it firmly believes that it is important for people to know when photorealistic content has been created using AI, adding it already labels photorealistic images created using 'Meta AI' by putting visible markers that can be seen on the images, and both invisible watermarks and metadata embedded within image files. ""We are also building tools to label AI-generated images from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Adobe, Midjourney, and Shutterstock that users post to Facebook, Instagram and Threads,"" Meta said in a blogpost titled 'How Meta Is Preparing For Indian General Elections 2024'. ""We are dedicated to the responsible use of new technologies like GenAI and collaborating with industry stakeholders on technical standards for AI detection, as well as combating the spread of deceptive AI content in elections through the Tech Accord,"" it said. The social media giant said the India-specific Elections Operations Centre will bring together experts from across the company from intelligence, data science, engineering, research, operations, content policy and legal teams, to identify and mitigate threats in real-time across its apps and technologies. Meta said that starting this year, the company also requires advertisers globally to disclose when they use AI or digital methods to create or alter a political or social issue ad in certain cases. This applies if the ad contains a photorealistic image or video, or realistic-sounding audio, that was digitally created or altered to depict a real person as saying or doing something they did not say or do. Or if an ad depicts a realistic-looking person that does not exist or a realistic-looking event that did not happen, or depicts a realistic event that allegedly occurred, but that is not a true image, video, or audio recording of the event. As the world's largest democracy prepares for the general elections, Meta said it will continue its efforts to limit misinformation, remove voter interference, and enhance transparency and accountability on its pl...",1
Ad-free Facebook might get way cheaper to appease EU regulators,2024-03-19T13:10:48+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105660/meta-ad-free-subscription-facebook-instagram-gdpr-dma-eu-privacy-regulation,"By  Jon Porter, a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards. Meta says it’s offered to reduce the price of its ad-free subscription for Instagram and Facebook in Europe to address regulatory concerns, Reuters reports. Speaking in a hearing with the European Commission, Meta lawyer Tim Lamb said the company has “offered to drop the price from €9.99 to €5.99 for a single account and €4 for any additional accounts” in its discussion with privacy regulators in an attempt to “get to a steady state.” Lamb said €5.99 is “by far the lowest end of the range that any reasonable person should be paying for services of this quality” and hoped that the “regulatory uncertainty” will “settle down quickly.” It reportedly made the offer to cut its prices to data protection authorities earlier this year. The company launched its ad-free subscription last November after European Union regulators challenged the legal basis for its collection and processing of user data. Meta hoped that this “Subscription for no ads” program would allow it to effectively get consent to process user data under the EU’s GDPR rules as well as the Digital Markets Act. The subscription is available in the European Economic Area and Switzerland. But the paid tier was quickly the subject of complaints from consumer groups, who’ve attacked the measure as a “pay-or-consent” smokescreen. “Meta’s offer to consumers is smoke and mirrors to cover up what is, at its core, the same old hoovering up of all kinds of sensitive information about people’s lives which it then monetises through its invasive advertising model,” the European Consumer Organisation’s (BEUC) deputy director general, Ursula Pachl, said in a statement in February. Eight consumer groups from the BEUC’s network filed complaints with their respective national data protection authorities accusing Meta of not complying with the GDPR. The group said Meta doesn’t have a “valid legal basis” to justify its data collection and that “the choice it imposes on its users can not lead to their freely given and informed consent.” It’s unclear whether simply lowering the price of this monthly subscription will address these privacy concerns. Although privacy rights group NOYB attacked the cost of the subscription for being “way out of proportion” to the value Meta gets from tracking EU users, other groups have more structural complaints with the way the subscription has been implemented. BEUC, which serves as an umbrella group of 45 consumer organizations, has called for Meta to give consumers more time to think about their choice, for example, and to be more transparent about which data is collected under the paid option.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

 Wall Street analysts say the tech giants could get a split of billions in revenue Sharks are circling TikTok after House lawmakers last week passed a bill that if signed into law would essentially ban the app in the U.S. — unless China-based owner ByteDance sells it to a company without ties to the Chinese Government.  Should the ban take effect, three of TikTok’s competitors stand to benefit the most: Meta, Alphabet, and Snap Inc. These companies could see a bump in engagement on their short-form video platforms and get a split of billions in revenue, Wall Street analysts said. “Given the enormous usage and engagement of TikTok in the U.S., banning TikTok would be a windfall for Meta, Google and Snapchat,” Lightshed Partners analyst Rich Greenfield wrote in a blog post on Thursday.

 As the world’s largest democracy prepares for the 18th General Elections, Meta (erstwhile Facebook) will continue efforts to limit misinformation, remove voter interference, and enhance transparency and accountability on its platforms to support free and fair elections, the company said on Tuesday.  “Towards this, we have around 40,000 people globally working on safety and security, with more than $20 billion invested in teams and technology in this area since 2016,” it said adding that this includes 15,000 content reviewers who review content across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads in more than 70 languages — including 20 Indian languages. The company said it is also “closely engaged with the Election Commission of India via the Voluntary Code of Ethics” that it joined in 2019, which gives the Commission a high priority channel to flag unlawful content to Meta.   “We are dedicated to responsible use of new technologies like GenAI and collaborating with industry stakeholders on technical standards for AI detection, as well as combating the spread of deceptive AI content in elections through the Tech Accord,” the Mark Zuckerberg owned company said.  More recently, the company has committed to taking a responsible approach to new technologies like GenAI and it will be drawing on all of these resources in the run up to the elections.  “As for all major elections, we’ll also activate an India-specific Elections Operations Center, bringing together experts from across the company from our intelligence, data science, engineering, research, operations, content policy and legal teams to identify potential threats and put specific mitigations in place across our apps and technologies in real time,”it further said.  On addressing online misinformation, it said the company removes the most serious kinds of misinformation from Facebook, Instagram and Threads, such as content that could suppress voting, or contribute to imminent violence or physical harm.   “During the Indian elections, based on guidance from local partners, this will include false claims about someone from one religion physically harming or harassing another person or group from a different religion. For content that doesn’t violate these particular policies, we work with independent fact-checking organisations,” the company said.   Meta added that it was continuing to expand the network of independent fact-checkers in the country – from 11 partners across India covering 15 languages, making it one of its largest networks for a country.   Tech-giant Google had also last week announced that it has partnered with the ECI to provide authoritative information on voting processes for the upcoming general elections via Google Search and YouTube videos.  Both Google and Shakti (a pan-India network) will work together to aid in the detection of on...",2
Meta offers lower cost for EU ad-free subscription under privacy review,2024-03-19T11:58:16+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/19/meta-ad-free-subscription-price-cut-offer/,"Meta has proposed to drop the price of an ad-free subscription in the European Union — currently the only way regional users of its social networks, Facebook and Instagram, can avoid its tracking and profiling. Meta’s lawyer Tim Lamb revealed the detail at a workshop taking place in Brussels today to discuss its approach to complying with the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), per Reuters — which reports Meta offered to almost halve the cost of the subscription in discussions with privacy regulators, from €9.99 per month per Facebook or Instagram account, to €5.99 (and with a slightly reduced monthly fee per each additional account). “We have wanted to accelerate that process for some time because we need to get to a steady state … so we have offered to drop the price from 9.99 to 5.99 for a single account and 4 euros for any additional accounts,” Reuters quoted Lamb as saying. The reduced offer was made to regulators earlier this year, it also reported. Meta spokesman Matthew Pollard confirmed the report is accurate. But it’s not clear whether Meta will actually drop the price or not. “[W]e await feedback from the Irish Data Protection Commission [DPC], our lead data protection regulator in the EU,” he added. The DPC’s deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, declined to answer questions about what exactly it’s assessing as regards Meta’s pricing. He also wouldn’t give an update on the authority’s wider assessment of the legality of Meta’s approach to obtaining consent — which it has been reviewing since last summer. “We can’t comment on this matter at the moment, as the assessment is continuing,” Doyle said. Using Meta’s social networks privately without charge is not currently an option in the EU despite the adtech giant (briefly) allowing regional users who exercised a right to object to its tracking to opt out of use of their data for ads last year — when it was claiming a “legitimate interest” (LI) for ads processing, after its earlier claim (contractual necessity) was found to breach data protection rules in January 2023. The Court of Justice of the EU went on to dismantle Meta’s ability to claim an LI for the processing in a ruling last summer — after which Meta said it would shift to consent. However, the consent mechanism it devised is controversial because it offers users a Hobson’s choice of paying it money to access the mainstream social networks or continuing to get free access but with tracking. Critics say Meta’s approach relies upon economic coercion to manipulate users to accept tracking, arguing it does not comply with the bloc’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — which requires consent to be freely given. So Meta’s level of pricing is explicitly contested. (In one of its complaints, privacy rights group noyb contends the pricing is “way out of proportion,” for example). There are other privacy complaints, too. Additionally, consumer protection complaints about Meta’s approach have also been raised. The regulatory picture is fu...",-1

Twitch’s newest meta is playing video games on people’s butts and breasts,2024-03-19T10:50:48+00:00,https://metro.co.uk/2024/03/19/twitchs-newest-meta-playing-video-games-peoples-butts-breasts-20489159/,"Streamers have found yet another creative way to broadcast their content, this time with the help of green screens and body parts, While some streamers play video games the traditional way, others find very creative ways to gain some attention on platforms like Twitch and Kick. Some recent examples include playing Elden Ring with Morse code and, more controversially, the fake nudity trend that saw streamers pretend to be naked or cover themselves up with censor bars – which was eventually banned by Twitch. Now another unnecessarily sexual meta has popped up on Twitch, where streamers are using green screens to show content and play games on their bodies. Streamer Morgpie, who spearheaded the nudity trend from last year, was the first to popularise the idea, by green-screening her shorts and displaying the contents of her monitor on herself. She’s done this with YouTube videos and while playing Fortnite, and many other streamers have followed her example. This includes VTuber Nyx Nekota arranging it so her avatar’s chest is displaying the games she’s playing. The future of streaming is here https://t.co/S2osOeAdBT pic.twitter.com/Ix8jv3tFac It hasn’t taken long for the newest Twitch meta to turn into satire, though, as male streamers have started making fun of the trend. Streamer Abstract copied Morgpie’s shorts trick and broadcasted playing Overwatch 2. Another streamer, Drew The Dude, did the same thing but put the display of him playing Fortnite on his forehead. the boys can get in on this new twitch meta also pic.twitter.com/uxjzzotn2q Dr Disrespect claims he lost Nike and Oakley deals after Twitch ban Twitch accused of having multiple view-botters abusing the system Twitch challenge goes viral with streamers trying to name 100 women Twitch CEO personally unbans streamer accused of showing sexual content Nobody seems to have been banned for it yet, so Twitch could be fine with it or is just waiting to see if it’ll all blow over, like most trends. It probably won’t grow in popularity much, as it’s quite difficult for the viewer to see what’s happening on the screen, but it’s certainly different. ð pic.twitter.com/e9IZqIGqp5 Email gamecentral@metro.co.uk, leave a comment below, follow us on Twitter, and sign-up to our newsletter.

"OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Google, Tesla, and more are all on the NVIDIA Blackwell train",2024-03-19T06:59:02+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96963/openai-microsoft-amazon-meta-google-tesla-and-more-are-all-on-the-nvidia-blackwell-train/index.html,"NVIDIA has unveiled its next-gen Blackwell AI GPU, which features 208 billion transistors, 192GB of super-fast HBM3E memory, a cutting-edge custom TSMC 4NP process, and groundbreaking new networking that sees NVIDIA NVLink deliver 1.8TB/s bidirectional throughput per GPU. The company also announced its new NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which connects two NVIDIA B200 Tensor Core GPUs to the NVIDIA Grace CPU ""over a 900GB/s ultra-low-power NVLink chip-to-chip interconnect."" With serious AI horsepower, NVIDIA's powerful next-gen AI hardware arrives during the AI boom, so, unsurprisingly, it announced its long list of Blackwell partners. NVIDIA writes, ""Among the many organizations expected to adopt Blackwell are Amazon Web Services, Dell Technologies, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla, and xAI."" Even though most, if not all, of these companies are investing in creating their own AI chips and hardware for generative AI-which is used in everything from scientific research to medicine and chatbots-Blackwell will drive many of the advances over the next few years. Blackwell's entry into AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure data centers and clusters is impressive and will probably increase NVIDIA's fortunes even more. With today's announcements, many of the leaders of the biggest tech companies in the world have issued statements reaffirming their commitment to AI while singing Blackwell's praises. However, it is pretty funny that Elon Musk's statement is basically, ""NVIDIA hardware is good."" ""Scaling services like Search and Gmail to billions of users has taught us a lot about managing compute infrastructure. As we enter the AI platform shift, we continue to invest deeply in infrastructure for our own products and services, and for our Cloud customers. We are fortunate to have a longstanding partnership with NVIDIA, and look forward to bringing the breakthrough capabilities of the Blackwell GPU to our Cloud customers and teams across Google, including Google DeepMind, to accelerate future discoveries.""Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google.

Could it be that the information revolution – big tech, big data, the internet and social media – is changing how the economy works in ways we’ve yet to understand and won’t like? The world abounds with economists repeating their conventional wisdom about how the economy works and will keep on working.

In the Middle Ages, feudalism was a system of reciprocal military and economic obligations running from the king to his land-owning lords, whose vassals managed their land worked by serfs. In Varoufakis’s dystopian vision, the digital revolution, led by a few big technology companies – Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google), Apple, Amazon and Microsoft – is turning capitalism into “technofeudalism”. Hence the title of his book, Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism. In the internet’s initial phase, it was characterised by open protocols and decentralised networking, focused on information sharing and communication. Now, however, it has evolved towards more commercialised, centralised services, including social media, e-commerce and cloud computing. His metaphor for the changed parts of the economy is the “cloud”. The capitalists – owners of physical capital - are being replaced by “cloudalists”: individuals or businesses that control the major digital platforms (such as the Facebook, Google and Twitter sites) and related infrastructure, which allows them to extract “cloud rent” from the consumers and businesses using their platforms. “Fief” is the feudal word for land. But “cloud fiefs” are Varoufakis’s term for the digital domains and platforms controlled by the cloudalists. These can be specific services, apps or platforms where the cloudalists have significant control, allowing them to extract “cloud rent”. This process is similar to the way feudal lords controlled land and extracted ordinary rent from those using it.

Facebook News tab will soon be unavailable as Meta scales back news and political content (Business),2024-03-28T21:38:00+00:00,https://www.castanet.net/news/Business/479341/Facebook-News-tab-will-soon-be-unavailable-as-Meta-scales-back-news-and-political-content,"Meta will be sunsetting Facebook News in early April for users in the U.S. and Australia as the platform further deemphasizes news and politics. The feature was shut down in the U.K., France and Germany last year. News is, of course, banned from Meta platforms in Canada. Launched in 2019, the News tab curated headlines from national and international news organizations, as well as smaller, local publications. Meta says users will still be able to view links to news articles, and news organizations will still be able to post and promote their stories and websites, as any other individual or organization can on Facebook. The change comes as Meta tries to scale back news and political content on its platforms following years of criticism about how it handles misinformation and whether it contributes to political polarization. “This change does not impact posts from accounts people choose to follow; it impacts what the system recommends, and people can control if they want more,” said Dani Lever, a Meta spokesperson. “This announcement expands on years of work on how we approach and treat political content based on what people have told us they wanted.” Meta said the change to the News tab does not affect its fact-checking network and review of misinformation. But misinformation remains a challenge for the company, especially as the U.S. presidential election and other races get underway. “Facebook didn’t envision itself as a political platform. It was run by tech people. And then suddenly it started scaling and they found themselves immersed in politics, and they themselves became the headline,” said Sarah Kreps, director of the Tech Policy Institute in the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy who studies tech policy and how new technologies evolve over time. “I think with many big elections coming up this year, it’s not surprising that Facebook is taking yet another step away from politics so that they can just not, inadvertently, themselves become a political headline.” Rick Edmonds, media analyst for Poynter, said the dissolution of the News tab is not surprising for news organizations that have been seeing diminishing Facebook traffic to their websites for several years, spurring organizations to focus on other ways to attract an audience, such as search and newsletters. “I would say if you’ve been watching, you could see this coming, but it’s one more very hurtful thing to the business of news,” Edmonds said. News makes up less than 3% of what users worldwide see in their Facebook feeds, Meta said, adding that the number of people using Facebook News in Australia and the U.S. dropped by over 80% last year. However, according to a 2023 Pew Research study, half of U.S. adults get news at least sometimes from social media. And one platform outpaces the rest: Facebook.

"Ontario schools are suing firms behind TikTok, Meta, Snapchat. Here’s why",2024-03-28T19:51:33+00:00,https://globalnews.ca/news/10390383/ontario-schools-are-suing-firms-behind-tiktok-meta-snapchat-heres-why/,"Instructions: Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first. 
				If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.			 Four Ontario school boards are taking some of the world’s biggest and most popular social media giants to court, seeking damages worth $4.5 billion. The Toronto District School Board, the Peel District School Board, the Toronto Catholic District School Board, and the Ottawa Carleton District School Board on Wednesday filed a claim in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. They sought damages from the companies behind Snapchat and TikTok as well as Meta, which owns both Facebook and Instagram. The schools have alleged that these social media platforms impact the mental health and learning capacities of students and create “widespread disruption to the education system.” Toronto District School Board trustee Rachel Chernos Lin said schools have noted social withdrawal, anxiety, mental health concerns and rise in aggressive behaviors in students linked to social media use. “Over 45 per cent of young people are spending over five hours on social media a day,” she said. “That’s having a tremendous impact on their mental health, their well-being, their behaviors, their attention span.” Here’s what to know. Duncan Embury, head of litigation at the Toronto law firm Neinstein LLP, said, “We’ve issued claim on behalf of four of the biggest school boards in Ontario against the social media giants Meta, Snap and TikTok for the disruption of the education system and the effect on adolescents and students of these products and what that means for their education and what it means for the resources at the schools.” The lawsuit claims that social media giants owe a responsibility because they “knowingly and/or negligently engineered products and design features to manipulate brain neurochemistry and to induce excessive and/or compulsive and/or addictive and/or problematic use amongst students.” Lin said, “They’re (the apps) doing tremendous harm to young people. They’re affecting the way they learn, the way they behave, the way they feel.” She added, “When students are distracted, when they’ve withdrawn socially, when they’re having anxiety… that has an impact on a teacher’s ability to actually deliver the educational piece and the content that kids need to learn.” Imran Ahmed is the CEO of the think tank, Center for Countering Digital Hate in Washington, D.C. He said teens are now facing a digital environment “full of disinformation, full of lies, full of hate, full of eating disorder and self-harm content. But it’s also changing the way that they process information.” The statements of claim point out specific design choices in certain social media apps, that the lawsuit alleges are intended to keep young users engaged while simultaneously reducing their attention spans. They said in addition to providing “endless and infinite content,” these apps lack effective pa...",-3
The ‘Funniest Joke’ In The ‘Invincible’ Comics Has Finally Made It To The TV Show,2024-03-28T19:16:23+00:00,https://uproxx.com/tv/invincible-funniest-joke/,"Fans of The Boys TV show who read the source material waited years for “Herogasm.” Now, Invincible, another Amazon Prime Video series based on a popular comic book series, will have its “Herogasm” moment (minus the “airborne penetration,” “dildo-based maiming,” and “icicle phalluses”).  On Thursday, the show’s official X account wrote, “Turns out the funniest joke in the comic works in the show too!!!” along with a clip from season two, episode seven. In it, Mark (voiced by Steven Yeun) meets a comic book creator named Filip Schaff (Tim Robinson) (!!) whose face is obscured the first time we see him. It’s part of a lengthy joke about animated shows cutting corners to save money. “You ever notice that sometimes whoever’s speaking has their mouth off camera so you never see their lips moving?” Filip says off camera. When the scene cuts back to Mark, he has his hand over his mouth.  The conversation continues: Filip: “Or we’ll cut to the back of someone’s head when they’re talking for the same reason. Other times we’ll do a wide shot and slowly pan across it. It looks like it’s animated but it’s so far away you don’t notice nothing’s moving. The best part is, because all these scenes have limited animation, we can make the drawings even better. But sometimes the artists get carried away and it kind of looks like a different show. It’s crazy what you can get away with. Thanks for coming by! Mark: “No, thank you! I’m gonna watch season two way closer.” You can watch the clip below. Turns out the funniest joke in the comic works in the show too!!! pic.twitter.com/nbYHJXHWTf — INVINCIBLE (@InvincibleHQ) March 28, 2024  Invincible season two is available to watch on Amazon Prime Video.",0

Mark Zuckerberg told Meta executives to ‘figure out’ how to crack encrypted Snapchat data: court docs,2024-03-28T15:37:33+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/28/business/mark-zuckerberg-told-meta-executives-to-obtain-snapchat-data-court-docs/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg once pressed executives to “figure out” how to obtain encrypted data from rival Snapchat in order to gain a leg up in the advertising market, according to unsealed court documents. Zuckerberg gave the directive in a 2016 email to Javier Olivan, who formerly served as Facebook’s head of growth and has since become Meta’s chief operating officer, and two other executives. At the time, Facebook was facing fierce competition from a rising Snapchat, which had yet to go public and was experiencing rapid user growth. “Whenever someone asks a question about Snapchat, the answer is usually that because their traffic is encrypted we have no analytics about them,” Zuckerberg wrote in the email. “Given how quickly they’re growing, it seems important to figure out a new way to get reliable analytics about them. Perhaps we need to do panels or write custom software. You should figure out how to do this,” he added. The email surfaced this week as part of a class-action lawsuit underway in California federal court. Meta stands accused of deceiving users about its data collection practices as part of a broader anti-competitive effort to dominate the social media market. Zuckerberg’s order jumpstarted an internal effort to glean useful data about Snapchat usage that was known internally by the project name “Ghostbusters” — a likely reference to Snap’s logo, according to the documents. The Post has reached out to Snap for comment. To fulfill the boss’s wishes, Facebook employees allegedly used an app called Onavo, which was shut down in 2019 following revelations that the company had paid teenagers in exchange for tracking their online habits, TechCrunch reported. As a result of the effort, Facebook developed software “kits” that allowed the company to “intercept traffic for specific sub-domains, allowing us to read what would otherwise be encrypted traffic so we can measure in-app usage,” according to a July 2016 email cited in the documents. Facebook later used the same tactic to glean crucial data from rivals such as Alphabet-owned YouTube and Amazon, the suit alleges. “There is nothing new here — this issue was reported one years ago,” a Meta spokesperson said. “The plaintiffs’ claims  are baseless and completely irrelevant to the case.” Meta also fired back in its own court filing on Tuesday. “Snapchat’s own 30(b)(6) witness on advertising confirmed that Snap cannot ‘identify a single ad sale that [it] lost from Meta’s use of user research products,’ does not know whether other competitors collected similar information, and does not know whether any of Meta’s research provided Meta with a competitive advantage,” the filing said. The lawsuit is one of several legal headaches for Meta, which has faced intense scrutiny from federal lawmakers over its failure to protect underage users from harmful content that has fueled...",-3

                                                 4 Canadian school boards sue Snapchat, TikTok and Meta for disrupting students’ education                                                  TORONTO (AP) — Four of the largest school boards in the Canadian province of Ontario said Thursday they launched lawsuits against TikTok, Meta and SnapChat alleging the social media platforms are disrupting student learning. The lawsuits claim platforms like Facebook and Instagram are “designed for compulsive use, have rewired the way children think, behave, and learn” and teachers have been left to manage the fallout.  Meta Platforms Inc. owns Facebook and Instagram, while Snap Inc. owns SnapChat and ByteDance Ltd. owns TikTok.  Rachel Chernos, a trustee for the Toronto District School Board, said teachers and parents are noticing social withdrawal, anxiety, attention problems, cyber bullying and mental health issues.  “These companies have knowingly created programs that are addictive that are aimed and marketed at young people and it is causing significant harm and we just can’t stand by any longer and not speak up about it,” Chernos said.  Dozens of U.S. states, including California and New York, are also suing Meta Platforms Inc. for harming young people and contributing to a youth mental health crisis by knowingly and deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. The school boards in Canada suing are the Toronto District School Board, the Peel District School Board, the Toronto Catholic District School Board and the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board. They are seeking damages in excess of $4 billion Canadian (US$2.9 billion) for disruption to student learning and the education system. A spokeswoman for Snap Inc., Tonya Johnson, said Snapchat helps its users stay connected with their friends.  “Snapchat opens directly to a camera — rather than a feed of content — and has no traditional public likes or comments,” she said. “While we will always have more work to do, we feel good about the role Snapchat plays in helping close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence.” Representatives of Meta and ByteDance didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.  Duncan Embury, a lawyer for the firm representing the boards, said there is a real addiction issue with the designed algorithms.  Embury said proper warnings are needed, age parameters need to change and there needs to be an increase in the level of resources school boards get to adapt to the new reality. He said the companies have knowingly and negligently designed their products to maximize the amount of time young people spend on their platforms at the expense of their wellbeing and education. “There is an inability for students to focus,” he said.  The use of social media among t...",-3

MLB Home Run Derby VR gives gamers the chance to explore 30 different ballparks and play up to 100 different levels. ""This upgraded game offers an exciting opportunity to experience each venue like never before and utilizing advanced motion controls and realistic batting mechanics, users can step into the virtual batter's box to emulate their favorite sluggers from anywhere in the world,"" MLB shared in its announcement. The game also offers multiplayer mode for up to four people or tournaments for up to eight. Users can choose winners by score, fastest exit velocity or longest home run. Plus, achievements can unlock bat skins, batting gloves and more for their Meta avatars. MLB Home Run Derby VR is available for $30 in the Meta Quest Store, but non-Meta users can pick it up on Rift or Steam VR platforms. This launch isn't MLB's first foray into VR: The organization hosted its first ""virtual ballpark"" regular-season game in September. The experience allowed viewers to ""enter"" the stadium and watch avatars correspond to real-time gameplay between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Los Angeles Angels. Peter Higgs, the famous physicist who predicted the Higgs boson particle, has passed away at the age of 94. He won the Nobel Prize in 2013 for his research.

VR headsets vulnerable to 'Inception attacks' — where hackers can mess with your sense of reality and steal your data,2024-03-28T11:30:14+00:00,https://www.livescience.com/technology/virtual-reality/vr-headsets-vulnerable-to-inception-attacks-where-hackers-can-mess-with-your-sense-of-reality-and-steal-your-data,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Popular VR headsets like the Meta Quest or Apple Vision Pro can be broken into, with hackers adding fake experiences called ""inception layers"" that let them manipulate how a user behaves. Scientists have identified a vulnerability in virtual reality (VR) headsets that could let hackers access private information without the wearers' knowledge.  A hacker can insert a new ""layer"" between the user and the device's normal image source. Hackers can then deploy a fake app in the VR headset that might trick the wearer into behaving in specific ways or giving up their data. This is known as an ""Inception layer,"" referring to Chris Nolan's 2010 sci-fi thriller in which espionage agents infiltrate a target's mind and implant an idea the target assumes is their own.  The VR ""Inception attack"" was detailed in a paper uploaded March 8 to the preprint server arXiv, and the team successfully tested it on all versions of the Meta Quest headset. Researchers found several possible routes of entry into the VR headset, ranging from tapping into a victim's Wi-Fi network to ""side-loading"" — which is when a user installs an app (possibly loaded with malware) from an unofficial app store. These apps then either pretend to be the baseline VR environment or a legitimate app. All of this is possible because VR headsets don't have security protocols anywhere near as robust as in more common devices like smartphones or laptops, the scientists said in their paper. Using this new fake layer, hackers can then control and manipulate interactions in the VR environment. The user won't even be aware they're looking at and using a malicious copy of, say, an app they use to catch up with friends.

Some examples of what an attacker could do include altering the amount of money being transferred — and its destination — in any online transaction and logging somebody's credentials when logging into a service. Hackers can even add a fake VRChat app and use it to eavesdrop on a conversation or modify live audio using artificial intelligence (AI) to impersonate a participant. ""VR headsets have the potential to deliver users a deeply immersive experience comparable to reality itself,"" the scientists said in the paper. ""The flip side of these immersive capabilities is that when misused, VR systems can facilitate security attacks with far more severe consequences than traditional attacks.""  The immersive sensory input can give users a false sense of comfort, they claimed,  making them more likely to give up private information and trust what they see to than they do in other computing environments. —Smart glasses could boost privacy by swapping cameras for this 100-year-old technology —Watch scie...",-3
"Anti-LGBTQ posts are ‘widespread’ on Meta’s platforms, report claims",2024-03-28T11:01:47+00:00,https://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/meta-lgbtq-anti-transgender-content-glaad-facebook,"

28 Mar 2024  Image: © ink drop/Stock.adobe.com A report from GLAAD claims Meta’s lack of enforcement has allowed anti-transgender content to ‘flourish’ on Facebook, Instagram and Threads. LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD has criticised Meta for allegedly failing to stop the spread of “extreme anti-trans hate content” across its platforms. The group shared a report with various examples of this type of offensive content on platforms including Facebook and Instagram. GLAAD said it reported all of the examples through Meta’s reporting systems. The advocacy group claims Meta either replied that the posts did not violate its policies or “simply did not take action on them”. Meta did not respond to a request from SiliconRepublic.com for comment at time of publication. “As the trillion-dollar company’s revenues soar, Meta continues to lay off critical trust and safety teams and increasingly relies on ineffective AI systems for content moderation,” GLAAD said in the report. “Meanwhile, LGBTQ people and other targeted groups experience an increasing number of well-documented real-world harms stemming from these long-term anti-LGBTQ propaganda campaigns, driven by the anti-LGBTQ extremists that Meta allows to flourish on its platforms.” GLAAD also claims Meta’s lack of enforcement led to “rebukes and concern” from its Oversight Board. This board overturned a decision by Meta last year to leave up a Facebook post in which a “user targeted transgender people with violent speech”. The report shows various posts on Meta’s platforms that GLAAD claims directly breach the company’s policies around concepts such as hate speech, violence, harassment and suicide posts. GLAAD says the posts include examples of users sharing “extreme anti-trans slurs”, statements designed to be “dehumanising” and content promoting conversion therapy. “This is blatant hate speech that targets all transgender people, specifically on the basis of gender identity – in direct violation of Meta’s policies,” the report said about the use of certain derogatory slurs in some of these posts. Last year, X – when it was known as Twitter – faced criticism after it updated its hateful conduct policy to remove specific protections for its transgender users. This included the removal of a line that prohibited “targeted misgendering or deadnaming of transgender individuals”. Last month, this policy appeared to go through back-and-forth changes.

"Quanta Computer to make NVIDIA GB200-based AI servers for Google, Amazon, and Meta",2024-03-28T05:32:02+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97169/quanta-computer-to-make-nvidia-gb200-based-ai-servers-for-google-amazon-and-meta/index.html,"Quanta Computer is one of the largest OEM suppliers in the world, with new contracts won to build NVIDIA GB200 AI systems for the likes of Google, Amazon AWS, Meta, and some B200-based AI systems for Microsoft. The company will have its first GB200 AI servers in testing in July or August ""at the earliest"" reports UDN, with mass production expected in September. Quanta holds ""large OEM orders"" for GB200 servers from Google, Amazon AWS, and Meta which are provided as complete AI cabinets. Microsoft ordered some B200 servers, which means Quanta is building next-gen AI systems for all four major US cloud servers in one set of orders. NVIDIA's new GB200 cabinet AI servers cost around $2-3 million each, so we can expect some major revenues for NVIDIA in the second half of this year once these orders are processed. UDN reports that Quanta is ""optimistic"" that as a shortage of materials in the supply chain gets better, AI server shipments will increase as soon as May or June, while the second half of 2024 is expected to be an ""explosive period"". Quanta is expecting volume shipment in September, with Amazon AWS and Meta having their new NVIDIA GB200 AI servers up and running in the second half of the year. Once these US cloud service providers (CSPs) successfully expand, capital expenditure and customer demand is strong -- its insatiable right now, AI GPU demand -- UDN reports that Quanta's cloud business revenue will make up 40% of its yearly revenues in 2024, expected to pass notebook computers and become Quanta's biggest production line. NVIDIA's new B200 AI GPU can consume up to 1000W to 1200W depending on the configuration, with GB200 packages including 2 x B200 GPUs and a Grace CPU with powerful performance at the ready for AI workloads. The new GB200 and B200 AI GPUs will be the first to use water cooling, which is expected to make water cooling more mainstream in data center cooling markets. Quanta has recently developed liquid cooling technology through its subsidiary Werder Technology, which is said to be a ""major leap forward in water cooling technology"". Quanta has partnered with Singtel as a technology partner, where the companies will build a ""sustainable data center"" in Singapore, which will help the Singaporean government to super-speed their AI development.

Consumers Find Social Media Advertising “Creepy”,2024-03-28T00:06:01+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/consumers-find-social-media-advertising-creepy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=consumers-find-social-media-advertising-creepy,"Almost half of Australians find advertisements on social media platforms “creepy”, with consumers turning off the big social networks including Meta’s Facebook, Google, and the likes of Instagram and Tik Tok a new research study claim. A study from advertising tech outfit The Trade Desk has revealed increasing scepticism of how Meta and other tech companies harvest personal data. Ironically, the research is being highlighted by media Companies who are in a fight with Meta over payments for news streaming, after the US conglomerate said that they were not stumping up any more money for news stories. Trade Desk have not revealed the questions that solicitated answers or who paid for the research. BELGRADE – JULY 11, 2014 Popular social media icons facebook google plus and other on smart phone screen close up The Australia is pointing out that Meta – which has a market value of A$1.93 trillion – monitors users’ online activity to deliver personalised advertisements on its platforms, this is the same practise adopted by Google and other social media Companies with the issue not isolated to just one questionable social media Company. Recently Ireland’s Data Protection Commission fining Meta $647.3m after finding that the company violated EU privacy laws by saying such ads are necessary to execute contracts with users. Meta is appealing the ruling. James Bayes, general manager of The Trade Desk Australia and New Zealand, said Australian consumers are getting increasingly disgruntled as we head into a more privacy-conscious era. The research dished up by Trade Desk delivers information that is not new. He said the company’s research highlighted a concerning lack of trust about online data collection and that was now affecting the reputation of companies who advertise on social media platforms. “The reality is consumer behaviour has changed, expectations from consumers have changed – they’ve levelled up – and the industry needs to meet consumers at that point and move quickly to that point,” Mr Bayes said. Trade Desk’s research found 46 per cent of Australians find personalised ads on social media creepy and too personal, while about 50 per cent believe that social media ads are “listening” to them, resulting in users moving to and prioritising other online spaces – also known as “the open internet”, which includes news, websites, blogs, video and music streaming service.   02 9002 5900   [email protected] Level 1, 275 Alfred Street

Global XR Headsets Shipments Fell 19% In 2023,2024-03-27T23:36:36+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/global-xr-headsets-shipments-dropped-19-in-2023/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=global-xr-headsets-shipments-dropped-19-in-2023,"Counterpoint Research has claimed global shipments of XR headsets dropped 19% year on year last year, a decline that was driven by the absence of exciting new devices, and a lack of engaging use cases. Meta continues holding the largest share of the headset market, however, it fell from 77% to 59% after the launch of Sony’s PSVR2 headset. Meta Quest shipments also declined 38% last year, according to Counterpoint. “The Quest 3’s launch-quarter shipments were 33 percent lower than during the [preceding] Quest 2’s launch quarter. The higher price point of the Quest 3, along with the continued availability of the Quest 2 and competition from other headsets contributed to the decrease in shipments for the latest model.” If stats coming from IDC prove to be correct, shipments in the headset market could grow 44.2% to 9.7 million. Last week, the firm predicated growth will be driven by the Apple Vision Pro, as well as new models towards the end of this year. Research Manager, mobility and consumer device trackers at IDC, Jitesh Ubrani said, “Apple’s launch of the Vision Pro grabbed a lot of headlines and has raised awareness for AR and VR and although it’s priced out of reach for most, it is helping raise the bar for competitors. Along with Apple, many companies such as Meta and others have already begun their journey, transitioning from VR to mixed reality (MR); ultimately laying the groundwork for true AR experiences.”  Qualcomm is also set to help OEMs challenge Apple. Last September, the company revealed two new “spatial computing platforms,” the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 and the Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1. The XR2 features powerful graphics processing capabilities, whereas the AR1 was designed with smart glasses in mind. Together, they reach a wide range of use cases, and could convince more OEMs to design their own headsets, particularly if more content becomes available. Counterpoint said, “Engaging content remains one of the primary keys that could unlock greater XR adoption. The entry of major smartphone players in the segment could accelerate content production in the coming years. Particularly, Apple’s entry with the Vision Pro will contribute to greater content and use case development, as well as attract other players to enter the segment.” Apple has a track record of stimulating device growth for products nobody realised they wanted. The iPad unveiling raised eyebrows, and at the time smartwatches came out, the practicality of a watch needing charging every night raised questions.  Similar scepticisms are being asked about what the need of mixed reality headset is. Research Director with IDC’s AR/VR program, Ramon Llamas said, “Mixed reality…has been the exception and not the norm, but Apple has shone a bright light on MR with the Vision Pro. Next, look at how companies will increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence to analyse data and generate virtual content for the user. Finally, display technology will move from content consumption to con...",-2

The LGBTQ advocacy group found that “extreme anti-trans hate content remains widespread across Instagram, Facebook, and Threads.” The report documents dozens of examples of hate speech from Meta’s apps, which GLAAD says were reported to the company between June 2023 and March 2024. But though the posts appeared to be clear violations of the company’s policies, “Meta either replied that posts were not violative or simply did not take action on them,” GLAAD says. The reported content included posts with anti-trans slurs, violent and dehumanizing language and promotions for conversion therapy, all of which are barred under Meta’s rules. GLAAD also notes that some of the posts it reported came from influential accounts with large audiences on Facebook and Instagram. GLAAD also shared two examples of posts from Threads, Meta’s newest app where the company has tried to tamp down “political” content and other “potentially sensitive” topics. “The company’s ongoing failure to enforce their own policies against anti-LGBTQ, and especially anti-trans hate, is simply unacceptable,” GLAAD’s CEO and President Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statement. Meta didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. But GLAAD’s report isn’t the first time the company has faced criticism for its handling of content targeting the LGBTQ community. Last year the Oversight Board urged Meta to “improve the accuracy of its enforcement on hate speech towards the LGBTQIA+ community.” Peter Higgs, the famous physicist who predicted the Higgs boson particle, has passed away at the age of 94.

GLAAD report says Meta allows anti-trans hate to ‘flourish’ on its platforms,2024-03-27T19:55:52+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/27/24113755/meta-anti-trans-hate-speech-glaad-instagram-facebook-threads,"By  Gaby Del Valle, a policy reporter. Her past work has focused on immigration politics, border surveillance technologies, and the rise of the New Right. GLAAD, the world’s largest LGBTQ+ media advocacy group, claims that Meta’s content moderation system is allowing an “epidemic of anti-transgender hate” to flourish on its platform. A new report published by the group says Meta has allowed dozens of anti-trans posts — including ones that call for violence against private individuals — to stay online. The organization says that LGBTQ+ people “experience an increasing number of well-documented real-world harms” due to “propaganda campaigns, driven by the anti-LGBTQ extremists that Meta allows to flourish on its platforms.” The report documents several examples of anti-trans content posted to Facebook, Instagram, and Threads between June 2023 and March of this year, all of which GLAAD reported via Meta’s “standard platform reporting systems.” Some of the posts used hateful anti-trans slurs, while others — including an Instagram post depicting a person being beaten with stones that have been replaced by the laughing emoji — call transgender people “demonic” and “satanic.” Several posts accuse transgender people of being “sexual predators,” “perverts,” and “groomers,” which, in recent years, has been used as an anti-LGBTQ+ slur.  According to GLAAD’s findings, Meta often fails to remove posts that violate its own hate speech policies. After GLAAD flagged posts that violated Meta’s hate speech policies, “Meta either replied that posts were not violative or simply did not take action on them,” the report reads. Some of the posts were made by prominent accounts, including Libs of TikTok, which is run by far-right influencer Chaya Raichik. Raichik has become a fixture in conservative school board politics in recent years. In January, she was appointed to Oklahoma’s state library advisory committee. The report claims a “prominent anti-LGBTQ extremist account” created Facebook and Instagram posts attacking a gender nonconforming elementary school teacher in Kitsap, Washington, after which the school received a bomb threat. The news article cited in the report identifies the account as Raichik’s.  “Meta itself acknowledges in its public statements and in its own policies that hate speech ‘creates an environment of intimidation and exclusion, and in some cases may promote offline violence,’” GLAAD said in a statement to The Washington Post. Meta has not only allowed this content to stay on its social media platforms but has also profited from it: a 2022 Media Matters report found that Meta had run at least 150 ads on its platforms accusing people of being “groomers.” That year, Meta told the Daily Dot that making baseless accusations that LGBTQ+ people are groomers is a violation of its hate speech policies. Meta suspended the “Gays Against Groomers” Facebook account last September but later restored it. Meta told the Daily Dot that the suspension was the re...",-3
"Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg have personally recruited AI staffers as talent war heats up",2024-03-27T19:23:55+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/27/business/sergey-brin-mark-zuckerberg-have-personally-recruited-ai-staffers-as-talent-war-heats-up/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Tech companies are pulling out all the stops to hire top-tier talent in the field of artificial intelligence — so much so that billionaire moguls like Mark Zuckerberg and Sergey Brin are personally reaching out to candidates in hopes of convincing them to work for their firms. Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta Platforms Inc, has sent personally written notes to AI researchers at DeepMind, the lab owned by tech rival Google, in hopes of recruiting them to join Facebook’s parent company, according to a report in The Information. Brin, the fellow billionaire who made his fortune as co-founder of search engine Google, personally called a company employee who was about to leave for OpenAI and offered them a pay bump and other perks to persuade them to stay,  tech news site reported. It is unclear when the call was made. The Post has sought comment from Brin and Zuckerberg. Life update! 📢 Today is my first day as a Principal Llama Engineer of the @Meta's GenAI in Paris!  Massive thanks for a very personal involvement of Mano, @edunov, Mark, @ylecun, @jpineau1, Naila, Laurens & Ricardo to bring me onboard to https://t.co/3Dgw3GDS5f of @AIatMeta! pic.twitter.com/mhd4ksD64z Meta is looking to lure AI talent by extending job offers without interviewing the candidates and relaxing longstanding company policy to not raise the salary of an in-house employee who threatens to leave for a competitor, according to the report. Zuckerberg’s personal outreach, which is considered rare when considering the rank of the employee, has borne fruit.  Last week, Michal Valko, a senior engineer at DeepMind, announced that he was defecting to Meta to take up a role as principal engineer at the company’s AI-powered large language model LlaMA. In a social media post, Valko credited Zuckerberg’s pitch, saying he owed the Facebook founder “massive thanks for a very personal involvement.”  In the X post, Valko even referred to the billionaire CEO by his first name, “Mark.” Meta is considered a Silicon Valley laggard when it comes to tech companies’ salary packages for coveted AI researchers.  While ChatGPT-maker OpenAI pays its prized recruits a reported compensation package ranging from $5 million to $10 million mostly in the form of stock, Zuckerberg’s shop is offering a relatively measly $1 million to $2 million annual wage, according to The Information. A Wall Street Journal report cited data from Levels.fyi which found that the median compensation of 344 machine learning and AI engineers at Meta was nearly $400,000 a year including bonus and equity. While tech companies are laying off people in non-AI divisions, they are ramping up offers to engineers who can help them develop the know-how behind chat bots and language models. Some firms are even extending seven-figure annual pay packages to members of entire engineering teams in hopes of getting them...",2
New complaint against Meta claims Facebook is failing to keep its misinformation promises to Australians,2024-03-27T19:06:06+00:00,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-28/meta-complaint-on-australian-misinformation-disinformation/103629704," New complaint alleges Meta is misleading Australians over its disinformation and misinformation controls on Facebook Tech giant Meta is facing allegations that it has misled Australians by exaggerating its response to disinformation and misinformation on Facebook. The ABC can reveal the $US1.3 trillion ($AU1.9 trillion) company is the subject of a formal complaint, which alleges Meta is not living up to claims contained within its most recent transparency report. The seven-page submission by online safety research group Reset.Tech, states small changes such as rewording can circumvent Facebook's automated labelling of known falsehoods. The complaint outlines the treatment of a post with the message: ""Did you know ONLY 2 countries are still considered Sovereign? Russia & Australia."" The statement was found to be false by Meta's fact-checkers and labelled with a warning, along with any identical or ""near-identical"" posts Meta detected using artificial intelligence. However, problems emerged when the message was reworded slightly to say, ""There's only two countries that are still sovereign in the world. Australia and Russia."" The second post — and others like it — were left unlabelled, even though it contains the same falsehood. Labelled by Meta: Russia and Australia are the only two countries still considered sovereign. Not labelled by Meta: There's only two countries that are still sovereign in the world. Australia and Russia. Under Australia's voluntary code of practice for online platforms dealing with misinformation, companies are asked to publish annual transparency reports to show how they are dealing with viral falsehoods. Reset.Tech says it is concerned Meta is glossing over the labelling issue in its transparency report. Meta's report states that the company ""applies a warning label to content found to be false by third-party fact checking organisations"", adding that nine million pieces of Facebook content had been labelled in Australia throughout 2022. While nine million posts may sound impressive, according to Reset.Tech it is only a fraction of the whole, and the majority of known falsehoods could well be going unlabelled on Facebook. ""In actuality [they're] only labelling a tiny sub-portion of it … there's a real gap here between statement and practice,"" executive director of Reset.Tech, Alice Dawkins said. ""I don't think a company in any other sector could get away in the public transparency report, saying one thing and then actually doing another, much narrower, modest thing."" Meta denied the claims in its transparency report were misleading. In email correspondence with Reset.Tech, obtained by the ABC, a Meta spokesperson said: ""Meta does not assert, nor does the statement convey, that Meta detects and labels 'all variations of fact-checked falsehoods'.  ""Rather, the … language is clear that Meta proactively identifies content that 'matches' or is 'near-identical' to content that has been rated as 'false' by a fact-checking partner...",-2
Meta board responsible for content moderation advises company to loosen restrictions on word ‘shaheed’,2024-03-27T16:56:14+00:00,https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2024/03/27/meta-board-responsible-for-content-moderation-advises-company-to-loosen-restrictions-on-word-shaheed/,"The Meta Oversight Board, overseeing Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, has recommended that the social media conglomerate revoke the prohibition on using the term ‘shaheed’ an Arabic word meaning ‘martyr’ in English. The board believes this change will significantly impact media coverage of related events. The board, in its Tuesday opinion, stated that Meta’s method of moderating the mentioned word is “too broad and unfairly limits freedom of expression and public discourse.” The company had requested input from its board on its content moderation policy, as it currently considers all mentions of shaheed regarding individuals designated as “dangerous” as violations, leading to the removal of such content. In February 2023, Meta posed a question to its board regarding the ongoing removal of content that uses the Arabic term to describe individuals identified under its Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy. The US-based company has faced significant criticism from human rights organizations, particularly following conflict in Gaza. Activists have accused Meta of stifling dissenting pro-Palestinian voices and curtailing freedom of speech. Meta indicated that ‘shaheed’ leads to more content removals under its guidelines than any other word or phrase on its platforms. The advisory panel’s research was nearing completion when in October 2023 Israel was attacked by Hamas occurred, prompting the former to launch a full-scale military operation in Gaza, exacerbating tensions in the Middle East. Due to these developments, the publication of the policy advisory opinion was halted to ensure its recommendations aligned with the usage of ‘shaheed’ on Meta’s platforms in this context. The board noted that additional research confirmed its recommendations to Meta on moderating ‘shaheed,’ even amidst extreme events, to uphold human rights standards during crises. Furthermore, Meta’s approach failed to account for the diverse meanings of ‘shaheed,’ many of which do not glorify or approve, resulting in the removal of posts by Arabic and other language speakers (including many Muslims) that did not violate the Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy. The independent Meta Oversight Board emphasized that while “shaheed” is sometimes used by extremist organisations to glorify people who die while comitting violent and heinous acts of terrorism, Meta’s response should prioritize respect for all human rights, including freedom of expression. The board urged the social media company to lift its blanket ban on using the term to describe designated dangerous individuals and to adopt a more nuanced content analysis approach that considers context when dealing with content containing the word. The @OversightBoard decision re/ the word “Shaheed” is a timely step in the right direction. It is a significant win that follows extensive advocacy efforts by CSOs & advocates to challenge Meta’s discriminatory policies against individuals in our regionhttps://t.co/LJt...",-1

Oversight Board Calls Out Meta’s Arabic Word “Shaheed” Ban,2024-03-27T15:22:08+00:00,https://hiphopwired.com/2095479/oversight-board-calls-out-metas-arabic-word-shaheed-ban/," Trending Source: SEBASTIEN BOZON / Getty Facebook’s parent company Meta has been called out over the muting of an Arabic word on its platforms.  An oversight board has made a recommendation to Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Threads, and Instagram to loosen their blanket restrictions on the Arabic word “shaheed”. Meta had enacted a blanket ban on the word, reviewing it in 2020, and removing it from the posts of people on the platform that were deemed dangerous. In a statement, the “blunt method” was regarded as  “overbroad and disproportionately restricts freedom of expression and civic discourse,” wrote Oversight Board member Helle Thorning-Schmidt, saying it ignored the complexities of the word and settled for one definition meaning “martyr”. The group’s findings declared the ban unnecessary given the company’s established policies that can already address any danger posed by terrorist organizations and individuals on the platform when used properly. The board finalized their decision to make the recommendation after the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict on October 7, 2023, which currently has seen 32,000 Palestinians killed according to the Gaza Health Ministry after members of Hamas invaded an area of southern Gaza and killed or taken hostage 1,400 people. They had extended research on “shaheed” but still agreed on the recommendation.  “The term is used in many circumstances, but the vast majority of those referred to as Shaheed are civilians,” said Nadim Nashif, the executive director of The Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media. Thorning-Schmidt agreed, stating that the restriction stops legitimate usage of the word in reporting on discussions of terrorism and violence. “It can even lead to those speaking about deceased loved ones having their content taken down in error,” he said. Jewish advocacy groups have come out against any potential change, claiming that softening the restrictions would enable more antisemitism on the platforms. “These calls to terror and violence will be normalized and, more importantly, more people will be exposed to them, possibly leading to additional violence at a time there is already a lot of violence and targeted antisemitic attacks,” said Tal-Or Cohen Montemayor, the founder of CyberWell, an Israeli nonprofit group that tracks antisemitism online. Montemayor said that it flagged over 300 usages of “shaheed” in antisemitic posts on Facebook since October 7. “We want people to be able to use our platforms to share their views, and we have a set of policies to help them do so safely,” Meta said in a statement. They also said that they would review the feedback they’ve collected and make a decision in 60 days.

Fears grow Meta will block news on Facebook and Instagram as Australian government faces pressure to act,2024-03-27T14:00:27+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/28/meta-facebook-news-tab-instagram-fears-blocked-australian-government-regulation,"Publishers and politicians are siding against Meta and urging Labor to force the company to pay for news Meta will either reduce the amount of news people see or block it entirely on Facebook and Instagram, experts and publishers warn, as the government faces pressure to require Meta to show news content and pay for it. Meta informed publishers nearly a month ago that it would not enter new multimillion-dollar deals for content when contracts expire this year. Since then the Albanese government has kicked off a process to potentially designate the tech company under the news media bargaining code. Publishers received letters from the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, and assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, two weeks ago asking for information on whether Meta should be designated under NMBC, which would require Meta to negotiate with news publishers for payment for content shared on its platform or face fines worth 10% of its Australian revenue. Axel Bruns, a professor of communication and media studies at Queensland University of Technology’s Digital Media Research Centre, studied the impact of the six-day 2021 news ban in Australia, and told Guardian Australia it was likely Meta would stick with a ban, as it had in Canada since August. “The absence of news from their services that this produces would give them a pretty good argument to challenge any NMBC requirements to share ad revenue with Australian news publishers in court,” he said. Instagram last week introduced a change that opts users out of having political content recommended to them unless they opt into it. Meta has said it plans to make the change for Facebook too. Bruns said if Meta were not designated under the news media bargaining code, it would probably just continue to reduce the amount of news seen on the platforms. “In fact doing so gives them a good argument against designation too: the less news content plays any significant role [or] has any significant visibility on their platforms, the less there is an argument for sharing ad revenue with news publishers via the NMBC mechanism,” he said. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Smaller news publishers, many of whom did not make a deal with Meta when the NMBC was brought in back in 2021, agreed it was likely Meta would remove news. Tim Duggan, the chair of the Digital Publishers Alliance, a group of more than 100 smaller publishers such as Private Media, Broadsheet, Man of Many and others, said in an opinion piece this month that it was likely Meta would do what it did in Canada and block news. He said this disproportionately affected the smaller publishers that were more reliant on social media for traffic and revenue compared with larger news outlets, forcing staff cuts or closures. The alliance is reportedly calling for a “must carry” law that would require Meta to take news on its platforms. The publishers have an ally in News Corp, with the com...",1

Morning Report in your inbox! Today's E-Edition By Allison Morrow | CNN Meta blocked a newspaper’s critical report about it on Facebook and its other social sites for hours, sparking a backlash that intensified after the company appeared to subsequently block links to the website of an independent journalist who republished the report. The controversy began Thursday morning when users noticed that all links to the non-profit newspaper the Kansas Reflector had been flagged as a cybersecurity threat and their posts were removed. About seven hours later, the paper said, most of its links had been restored, save for one — a column that had criticized Facebook and accused it of suppressing posts related to climate change. Meta apologized to the Reflector and its readers on Thursday for what the company’s communications chief, Andy Stone, called a “an error that had nothing to do with the Reflector’s recent criticism of Meta.” But on Friday, users who attempted to share the column on Facebook, Instagram or Threads, were shown a warning that it violated community guidelines. That seemed suspicious to Marisa Kabas, an independent journalist in New York, who asked the Reflector for permission to publish the text of the column on her own website, the Handbasket. “I thought it would be a cool experiment,” Kabas told CNN on Friday. Around 1pm ET, she published the story on her own site, “in an attempt to sidestep Meta’s censorship,” she wrote in a preface to the column. She then shared her post on Threads. “A couple minutes later, I got an alert that it had been flagged and taken down for malicious content,” Kabas told CNN. Kabas’s post was banned from all Meta platforms for several hours Friday. And for about two hours, she said, all of the links to her site were blocked. Her links were all restored by late afternoon Friday, she said. In a Threads post on Friday, Stone said the blocked links were “due to a security error” that also mistakenly blocked links to The Handbasket and the nonprofit news aggregator site News From The States. “The incorrectly applied blocks have now been lifted,” he wrote. “This is undoubtedly frustrating and we sincerely apologize to all who have been impacted.” Stone didn’t immediately reply to CNN’s request for details about the security concern. “Sounds like a bug with our share scraper or possibly that the domain is getting caught up in a safety measure by mistake,” said Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a threads post Friday. “We certainly don’t block links to articles that are critical about us … I’ll talk to the team now though and chase down the bug so we can get it fixed ASAP.” The editor-in-chief of the Kansas Reflector, Sherman Smith, wrote on Friday that Stone “wouldn’t elaborate on how the mistake happened and said there would be no further explanation.” Kabas said the damage had already been done because the articles had already been flagged as malicious. “That’s a big pro...",-2

 Facebook giant Meta on Friday asked a federal judge to dismiss a case from a powerful U.S. antitrust authority that could see the social media juggernaut forced to sell Instagram and WhatsApp. The lawsuit, filed in December 2020 by the Federal Trade Commission, centers on Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the FTC argues stifled competition in the market for social networks. In the usual practice of trying to have the case dismissed before reaching trial, Meta said in a motion that its acquisitions were ""good for consumers and businesses"" and won approval by the FTC when they were made. ""The FTC reviewed both acquisitions years ago and allowed them to close. The decision to revisit done deals is tantamount to announcing that no sale will ever be final,"" Meta said in a statement. Meta also argued that TikTok and YouTube were absent in the FTC’s definition of the social media market, “ignoring many of the most popular activities people engage in on Facebook and Instagram."" The crux of the FTC's case claims Meta achieved a ""monopoly power"" by acquiring these potentially rival platforms. The case suffered a setback in June 2021 when a judge dismissed the initial complaint. However, the FTC refiled with an amended suit in August 2021, successfully surviving Meta's attempt to have it thrown out. The FTC has until May 30 to offer a counter-argument to Meta's plea to the judge; no trial has been set for the case. A trial win by the FTC could reshape the online landscape, potentially landing a major blow to Meta’s dominance of the social media ecosystem. The FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice, which shares antitrust enforcement, have launched a series of blockbuster cases against U.S. tech giants in recent years. The case against Google over its dominant search engine could be decided by a federal judge by the end of the year. Have you tried Japanese facial sheet masks?

Meta asks court to dismiss FTC’s monopoly claims,2024-04-05T18:10:18+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24121968/meta-motion-for-summary-judgment-ftc-monopoly-lawsuit,"By  Lauren Feiner, the senior policy reporter at The Verge, covering the intersection of Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill. She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform. Meta is asking a federal court to dispense with the Federal Trade Commission’s anti-monopoly lawsuit against it, arguing it’s failed to unearth evidence to support its claims. In a motion for summary judgment filed Friday, Meta argues that the lawsuit should be thrown out because the company believes the FTC won’t be able to prove what it claims is the relevant market in the case or that its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp harmed consumers. The FTC will get a chance to respond, and there will be back-and-forth in court filings before the judge decides how to proceed. A ruling in Meta’s favor could mark the end of the lawsuit, but if the court determines there are still issues of fact that need to be resolved, the judge could set a trial date. Back in 2021, DC District Court Judge James Boasberg granted Meta’s motion to dismiss the complaint but gave the FTC the chance to file an amended one, which he allowed to move forward. He said the new complaint was “far more robust and detailed than before” and the FTC “may well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations.” In its motion for summary judgment, Meta first attacks the FTC’s market definition, saying it’s unreasonably narrow. The FTC defined the relevant market as personal social networking services (PSNS), which are basically sites where there’s a social graph and users can engage with friends and family on primarily personal topics. It includes Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and MeWe, according to the FTC. “The FTC’s initial complaint was dismissed for failure to state a plausible claim,” Meta writes in its filing. “Its amended complaint survived in part, based on the FTC’s commitment to provide evidence that would support the existence of a PSNS relevant antitrust market, Meta’s monopoly power in that market, and harm to competition and consumers from Meta’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp ... After extensive discovery, it is now apparent that the FTC cannot prove any of the required elements of its Section 2 claim.” The FTC does not include TikTok or YouTube in its relevant market because it says those services serve a different purpose. TikTok is not “driven by users’ desire to interact with networks of friends and family,” the FTC wrote in its amended complaint, and YouTube is used “primarily for the passive consumption of specific media content (e.g., videos or music) from and to a wide audience of typically unknown users.” But Meta thinks this is wrong. It says the court just needs to look at how social media users interchange content between Instagram and TikTok or YouTube, particularly through their shortform video features. “The FTC contends that 100% of the time spent on Reels is PSNS, including watching Reels posted by cele...",2

 Under such a system detecting and labelling detected content as AI-generated needs to have repercussions for not having listed the content as AI-generated. Otherwise there is no incentive to correctly label the content to begin with. You just try and fly under the radar undetected, see what gets detected. Oh well, cost of doing business. Let's get ahead of it by having Meta ban everyone from Facebook.  Problem solved! They just want that label because they don't want to train their AI on AI generated garbage. So if you don't want your content to be used to train AI, label it was ""AI generated"". There may be more comments in this discussion.

Meta broadens its policies to label more deepfakes and add context to ‘high risk’ manipulated media,2024-04-05T17:29:58+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/05/meta-deepfake-labels/,"Meta has announced changes to its rules on AI-generated content and manipulated media following criticism from its Oversight Board. Starting next month, the company said, it will label a wider range of such content, including by applying a “Made with AI” badge to deepfakes. Additional contextual information may be shown when content has been manipulated in other ways that pose a high risk of deceiving the public on an important issue. The move could lead to the social networking giant labeling more pieces of content that have the potential to be misleading — important in a year of many elections taking place around the world. However, for deepfakes, Meta is only going to apply labels where the content in question has “industry standard AI image indicators,” or where the uploader has disclosed it’s AI-generated content. AI-generated content that falls outside those bounds will, presumably, escape unlabeled.  The policy change is also likely to lead to more AI-generated content and manipulated media remaining on Meta’s platforms, since it’s shifting to favor an approach focused on “providing transparency and additional context,” as the “better way to address this content” (rather than removing manipulated media, given associated risks to free speech). So, for AI-generated or otherwise manipulated media on Meta platforms like Facebook and Instagram, the playbook appears to be: more labels, fewer takedowns. Meta said it will stop removing content solely on the basis of its current manipulated video policy in July, adding in a blog post published Friday that: “This timeline gives people time to understand the self-disclosure process before we stop removing the smaller subset of manipulated media.” The change of approach may be intended to respond to rising legal demands on Meta around content moderation and systemic risk, such as the European Union’s Digital Services Act. Since last August, the EU law has applied a set of rules to its two main social networks that require Meta to walk a fine line between purging illegal content, mitigating systemic risks and protecting free speech. The bloc is also applying extra pressure on platforms ahead of elections to the European Parliament this June, including urging tech giants to watermark deepfakes where technically feasible. The upcoming U.S. presidential election in November is also likely on Meta’s mind. Meta’s advisory board, which the tech giant funds but permits to run at arm’s length, reviews a tiny percentage of its content moderation decisions but can also make policy recommendations. Meta is not bound to accept the board’s suggestions, but in this instance it has agreed to amend its approach. In a blog post published Friday, Monika Bickert, Meta’s VP of content policy, said the company is amending its policies on AI-generated content and manipulated media based on the board’s feedback. “We agree with the Oversight Board’s argument that our existing approach is too narrow since it only covers videos...",1
Meta to label broader range of AI-generated content,2024-04-05T17:27:23+00:00,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/04/05/Meta-AI-labeling-manipulated-video/3851712335886/,"


April 5 (UPI) -- Meta said on Friday it plans to label more content that is manipulated or created by artificial intelligence as part of an updated review process and policy after feedback from its Oversight Board.
The tech giant said it will begin labeling video, audio and image content on Facebook, Instagram and Threads with a ""Made with AI"" marking beginning in May on content that bears ""industry standard image indicators"" and when people disclose that images were made with AI.

""If we determine that digitally-created or altered images, video or audio create a particularly high risk of materially deceiving the public on a matter of importance, we may add a more prominent label so people have more information and context,"" Meta said.
Meta added that while it may add these more detailed labels, it won't remove the content from the platforms unless it violates other policies such as its policies against voter interference, bullying and harassment, violence and incitement, citing a ruling by the independent Oversight Board in February.

""We agree with the Oversight Board's recommendation that providing transparency and additional context is now the better way to address manipulated media and avoid the risk of unnecessarily restricting freedom of speech, so we'll keep this content on our platforms so we can add labels and content,"" said Monika Bickert, vice president of content policy at Meta, in a statement.
Advertisement
The Oversight Board urged Meta to update its approach at manipulated images to ""reflect a boarder range of content that exists today"" and provide proper context about the content with labels.
In February, the Oversight Board took Meta to said Meta's policy on AI-generated content was too narrow and provided a loophole for bad actors to get around the initial intent of identifying such manipulated content while protecting free speech.
In that particular incident, the board agreed to keep up a highly edited video that made it look like President Joe Biden was touching his granddaughter inappropriately but admitted the current policy left their hands tied.
""We agree with the Oversight Board's argument that our existing approach is too narrow since it only covers videos that are created or altered by AI to make a person appear to say something they didn't say,"" Bickert said.
""In the last four years, and particularly last year, people have developed other kinds of realistic AI-generated content like audio and photos and this technology quickly evolved. As the board noted, it's equally important to address manipulation that shows a person doing something they didn't do.""

Meta Quest 3 vs Meta Quest Pro: Which should you buy?,2024-04-05T12:15:17+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/versus/meta-quest-3-vs-meta-quest-pro-4332750,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience. If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. The Meta Quest 3 is one of the most popular standalone VR headsets around, but how does it compare to the premium Meta Quest Pro? While you might assume that the ‘pro’ VR headset will offer an all-round more premium experience with better performance, more advanced features and more, that’s only half the truth. It’s complicated by the fact that the cheaper Quest 3 not only has a better processor, but the same high-end mixed reality capabilities. The question is, then, do you really need to buy the Meta Quest Pro? We’ve spent plenty of time in the virtual world using both the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro, and here’s how the two compare.  Although the Meta Quest 3 is comfortably more expensive than its predecessor, at £489/$499 with 128GB of storage, it’s still half the price of the top-end Meta Quest Pro, which comes in at a cool £999/$999.  In fact, it started at an even more premium £1,499/$1,499 before Meta dropped the price months later, possibly due to the lack of interest in such a high-cost headset.   Both headsets are available to buy now from various retailers in the UK and US, as well as Meta itself.  Design is one area where the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro differ quite drastically. The Meta Quest 3 is a continuation of the design of the Quest 2, which is to say that it’s shaped a bit like a pair of skiing goggles and fits onto your head with stretchy fabric straps – in its default form anyway. The Meta Quest Pro, on the other hand, sports a rigid plastic headband with a crank mechanism to get the fit just right. The battery pack also lives in the back of the headset to help balance weight, an important factor considering the Quest Pro weighs in at a not-insignificant 772g– 257g more than the 515g Quest 3.  However, the biggest difference between them is that the Quest Pro doesn’t directly cover your face like most VR headsets do. Instead, the slimline HMD sits just in front of your eyes, with no kind of fascia to block the real world from your peripheral vision. This is done to facilitate more comfortable mixed reality experiences, and while it does come with side-blockers in the box for VR sessions, a full fascia – as you get with the Quest 3 – comes as an optional accessory.  Elsewhere, both headsets sport pancake optics that allow for a very slim HMD, especially noticeable from the jump from the Quest 2 to the Quest 3. They also sport USB-C and 3.5mm ports for headphones if the integrated open-air speakers don’t satisfy your needs.  The Meta Quest Pro’s controllers are notable not only because of their compact and ergonomic shape but also because of the tech within. Unlike the equally compact Quest 3 controllers, the Pro controllers sport a smattering of cameras to offer inside-out tracking independent of the headset.  This allows the Quest Pro controllers to continue delivering true 1:1 tracking even ...",1

What is AGI and how will we know when it’s been attained?,2024-04-05T08:55:45+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/04/05/what-is-agi-artificial-general-intelligence/,"There’s a race underway to build artificial general intelligence, a futuristic vision of machines that are as broadly smart as humans or at least can do many things as well as people can. Achieving such a concept — commonly referred to as AGI — is the driving mission of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and a priority for the elite research wings of tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft. It’s also a cause for concern for world governments. Leading AI scientists published research Thursday in the journal Science warning that unchecked AI agents with “long-term planning” skills could pose an existential risk to humanity. But what exactly is AGI and how will we know when it’s been attained? Once on the fringe of computer science, it’s now a buzzword that’s being constantly redefined by those trying to make it happen. Not to be confused with the similar-sounding generative AI — which describes the AI systems behind the crop of tools that “generate” new documents, images and sounds — artificial general intelligence is a more nebulous idea. It’s not a technical term but “a serious, though ill-defined, concept,” said Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering AI scientist who’s been dubbed a “Godfather of AI.” “I don’t think there is agreement on what the term means,” Hinton said by email this week. “I use it to mean AI that is at least as good as humans at nearly all of the cognitive things that humans do.” Hinton prefers a different term — superintelligence — “for AGIs that are better than humans.” A small group of early proponents of the term AGI were looking to evoke how mid-20th century computer scientists envisioned an intelligent machine. That was before AI research branched into subfields that advanced specialized and commercially viable versions of the technology — from face recognition to speech-recognizing voice assistants like Siri and Alexa. Mainstream AI research “turned away from the original vision of artificial intelligence, which at the beginning was pretty ambitious,” said Pei Wang, a professor who teaches an AGI course at Temple University and helped organize the first AGI conference in 2008. Putting the ‘G’ in AGI was a signal to those who “still want to do the big thing. We don’t want to build tools. We want to build a thinking machine,” Wang said. Without a clear definition, it’s hard to know when a company or group of researchers will have achieved artificial general intelligence — or if they already have. “Twenty years ago, I think people would have happily agreed that systems with the ability of GPT-4 or (Google’s) Gemini had achieved general intelligence comparable to that of humans,” Hinton said. “Being able to answer more or less any question in a sensible way would have passed the test. But now that AI can do that, people want to change the test.” Improvements in “autoregressive” AI techniques that predict the most plausible next word in a sequence, combined with massive computing power to train those systems on troves of data, have led to ...",2

AI-generated Asians were briefly unavailable on Instagram,2024-04-04T20:52:14+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121419/meta-instagram-ai-image-generator-asian-race,"By  Mia Sato, platforms and communities reporter with five years of experience covering the companies that shape technology and the people who use their tools. Yesterday, I reported that Meta’s AI image generator was making everyone Asian, even when the text prompt specified another race. Today, I briefly had the opposite problem: I was unable to generate any Asian people using the same prompts as the day before. The tests I did yesterday were on Instagram, via the AI image generator available in direct messages. After dozens of tries, I was unable to generate a single accurate image using prompts like “Asian man and Caucasian friend” and “Asian man and white wife.” Only once was the system able to successfully create a picture of an Asian woman and a white man — it kept making everyone Asian. After I initially reached out for comment yesterday, a Meta spokesperson asked for more details about my story, like when my deadline was. I responded and never heard back. Today, I was curious if the problem was resolved or if the system was still unable to create an accurate image showing an Asian person with their white friend. Instead of a slew of racially inaccurate pictures, I got an error message: “Looks like something went wrong. Please try again later or try a different prompt.”  Weird. Did I hit my cap for generating fake Asian people? I had a Verge co-worker try, and she got the same result.  I tried other even more general prompts about Asian people, like “Asian man in suit,” “Asian woman shopping,” and “Asian woman smiling.” Instead of an image, I got the same error message. Again, I reached out to Meta’s communications team — what gives? Let me make fake Asian people! (During this time, I was also unable to generate images using prompts like “Latino man in suit” and “African American man in suit,” which I asked Meta about as well.) Forty minutes later, after I got out of a meeting, I still hadn’t heard back from Meta. But by then, the Instagram feature was working for simple prompts like “Asian man.” Silently changing something, correcting an error, or removing a feature after a reporter asks about it is fairly standard for many of the companies I cover. Did I personally cause a temporary shortage of AI-generated Asian people? Was it just a coincidence in timing? Is Meta working on fixing the problem? I wish I knew, but Meta never answered my questions or offered an explanation.  Whatever is happening over at Meta HQ, it still has some work to do — prompts like “Asian man and white woman” now return an image, but the system still screws up the races and makes them both Asian like yesterday. So I guess we’re back to where we started. I will keep an eye on things.

                                                 Tech companies want to build artificial general intelligence. But who decides when AGI is attained?                                                  There’s a race underway to build artificial general intelligence, a futuristic vision of machines that are as broadly smart as humans or at least can do many things as well as people can. Achieving such a concept — commonly referred to as AGI — is the driving mission of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and a priority for the elite research wings of tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft. It’s also a cause for concern for world governments. Leading AI scientists published research Thursday in the journal Science warning that unchecked AI agents with “long-term planning” skills could pose an existential risk to humanity.  But what exactly is AGI and how will we know when it’s been attained? Once on the fringe of computer science, it’s now a buzzword that’s being constantly redefined by those trying to make it happen. What is AGI? Not to be confused with the similar-sounding generative AI — which describes the AI systems behind the crop of tools that “generate” new documents, images and sounds — artificial general intelligence is a more nebulous idea. It’s not a technical term but “a serious, though ill-defined, concept,” said Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering AI scientist who’s been dubbed a “Godfather of AI.” “I don’t think there is agreement on what the term means,” Hinton said by email this week. “I use it to mean AI that is at least as good as humans at nearly all of the cognitive things that humans do.” Hinton prefers a different term — superintelligence — “for AGIs that are better than humans.” A small group of early proponents of the term AGI were looking to evoke how mid-20th century computer scientists envisioned an intelligent machine. That was before AI research branched into subfields that advanced specialized and commercially viable versions of the technology — from face recognition to speech-recognizing voice assistants like Siri and Alexa.  Mainstream AI research “turned away from the original vision of artificial intelligence, which at the beginning was pretty ambitious,” said Pei Wang, a professor who teaches an AGI course at Temple University and helped organize the first AGI conference in 2008. Putting the ‘G’ in AGI was a signal to those who “still want to do the big thing. We don’t want to build tools. We want to build a thinking machine,” Wang said. Are we at AGI yet? Without a clear definition, it’s hard to know when a company or group of researchers will have achieved artificial general intelligence — or if they already have. “Twenty years ago, I think people would have happily agreed that systems with the ability of GPT-4 or (Google’s) Gemini had achieved general intelligence comparable to that of humans,” Hinton said. “...",2

Meta Quest 3 vs Pico 4: Which VR headset should you buy?,2024-04-04T11:33:10+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/versus/meta-quest-3-vs-pico-4-4514245,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience. If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. The Meta Quest 3 is the VR titan’s latest standalone VR headset, but there’s increased competition in the VR space now than when it launched the Quest 2 in 2020. With that said, how does the Meta Quest 3 compare to the Pico 4? While both headsets offer a broadly similar experience with slimline HMDs, fairly lightweight controllers and solid performance, there are key differences between the two that’ll influence which you should go for. That’s where we at Trusted Reviews come in; we’re virtual reality experts, and having spent a lot of time in the virtual world of both the Meta Quest 3 and Pico 4, here’s how the two compare.  The Pico 4 is the cheaper of the two VR headsets, with a £379 RRP, though the 128GB model can be found for just £279 at the time of writing. The catch? It’s only available in the UK and Europe, with no official US availability.  The Meta Quest 3, on the other hand, is available in the UK, Europe and the US, and starts at £479/$499 with the same 128GB of storage.  Design is somewhat subjective, but we feel that the Pico 4 is the better-looking of the two headsets. While both have similarly slim head-mounted displays thanks to the use of pancake lenses instead of older, larger fresnel-based lenses, the Pico 4 sports a stylish shape with an all-black fascia that makes it look more like the Apple Vision Pro than the Quest 3.  The Quest 3, while certainly not an ugly headset, doesn’t look quite as sleek with an all-grey plastic design and a small smattering of cameras placed centrally on the front of the headset, along with cameras around the edges for tracking. The Pico 4 also has cameras for passthrough and tracking, but with a black surround, it’s very hard to spot.  The Pico 4 also sports a rigid crank-style headband, with the battery placed at the back of the headset to help balance the weight – a similar system to the top-end Quest Pro. It really does help, as we felt the Pico 4 had a great sense of balance, while the Quest 3 felt a little front-heavy, especially during longer periods of play.   This does make the Pico 4 harder to transport in a rucksack, but it’s also much more stable and easier to fit than the awkward Y-shaped fabric band of the Quest 3. You can get a similar crank-style band for the Quest, but you’ll have to fork out an additional £69/$69 for the pleasure.  Stepping away from the headset, the Pico 4’s accompanying controllers look closer to those of the Quest 2, rather than the more recent Quest 3. In fact, they look near-identical, with the only real difference being that the Pico 4’s controllers are slightly longer and provide more room to grip. Compared to the Quest 3’s controllers, however, the Pico 4’s controllers look rather dated. While the two share the same broad design, sporting the same combination of face buttons, grip buttons, triggers and analogue sticks, the Quest ...",-1

Meta May Release a Version of Its Llama 3 AI Model This Month,2024-04-09T21:18:56+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/meta-may-release-a-version-of-its-llama-3-ai-model-this-month/,"Meta may be planning to release a more streamlined version of its Llama AI model this month, well before the major release expected later this summer. Meta has taken a decidedly different approach to AI than much of the rest of the tech industry, opting to open-source its Llama AI model. The company is expected to release a major new version later this summer, but The Information, via The Verge, is reporting that the social media giant may release smaller version of Llama as earlier as this month. Smaller AI models hold a lot of appeal for smaller companies, giving them much of the power of a full-fledged model while being nimbler and less expensive to run.

Associated Press Two tribal nations are accusing social media companies of contributing to the disproportionately high rates of suicide among Native American youth. Their lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles county court names Facebook and Instagram’s parent company Meta Platforms; Snapchat’s Snap Inc.; TikTok parent company ByteDance; and Alphabet, which owns YouTube and Google, as defendants. Virtually all U.S. teenagers use social media, and roughly one in six describe their use as “almost constant,” according to the Pew Research Center.  But Native youth are particularly vulnerable to these companies’ addictive “profit-driven design choices,” given historic teen suicide rates and mental health issues across Indian Country, chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street of the Spirit Lake Tribe in North Dakota said in a press release.  “Enough is enough. Endless scrolling is rewiring our teenagers’ brains,” added Gena Kakkak, chairwoman of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. “We are demanding these social media corporations take responsibility for intentionally creating dangerous features that ramp up the compulsive use of social media by the youth on our Reservation.”               Social media companies accused of ‘deliberate misconduct’ Their lawsuit describes “a sophisticated and intentional effort that has caused a continuing, substantial, and longterm burden to the Tribe and its members,” leaving scarce resources for education, cultural preservation and other social programs. A growing number of similar lawsuits are being pursued by USschool districts, states, cities and other entities, claiming that TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube exploit children and adolescents with features that keep them constantly scrolling and checking their accounts. New York City, its schools and public hospital system accuse the platforms of fueling a childhood mental health crisis that’s disrupting learning and draining resources. School boards in Ontario, Canada, claim teachers are struggling because platforms designed for compulsive use “have rewired the way children think, behave, and learn.” The Associated Press reached out to the companies for comment. Google said “the allegations in these complaints are simply not true.” “Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,” Google spokesperson José Castañeda said in a statement. “In collaboration with youth, mental health and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls.” Snap Inc. said it provides an alternative to a feed of online content. “We will always have more work to do, and will continue to work to make Snapchat a platform that helps close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence,” the company’s statement said.

Snapshot of the Race for More AI Compute,2024-04-09T19:23:26+00:00,https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2024/04/snapshot-of-the-race-for-more-ai-compute.html,"Home » Artificial intelligence » Snapshot of the Race for More AI Compute The number of Nvidia H100 and other Nvidia chips that an AI company represents the AI compute resources of that company. Elon indicated that a recent chart showing Meta leading on the GPU count and Tesla trailing at 10,000 G100 GPUs. Microsoft and OpenAI would also have higher GPU counts. It is unclear why Microsoft -OpenAI GPU counts were not included in the State of AI report. The 350k H100 GPUs for Meta would be about 1.4 Zettaflops. 24k H100s is about equal to 100 Exaflops of AI compute which is mostly FP8 or FP16 calculations.  Elon said XAI was using 20,000 Nvidia H100s to train Grok 2. This training is happening now and will be done by May 2024. 100,000 H100s are need to train Grok 3 and this will be about at the level of OpenAI GPT 5 level. This is the level of tokens where companies run out of realworld data. Companies will then need synthetic data and realworld video to train their models. If XAI were to start training Grok 3 as soon as possible after Grok 2 then XAI would be purchasing and installing another 80,000 H100s or H200s or B200s. I would estimate that Tesla and XAI have over 50k H100s equivalents and are in the process of acquiring and installing another 100-200k worth of H100s. XAI and Tesla and the other companies would all be acquiring Nvidia chips to get to 200,000 H100 equivalent or greater by Q3 of this year and to 1 million or more by next year. This is not accurate. Tesla would be second highest and X/xAI would be third if measured correctly. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 8, 2024    Brian Wang is a Futurist Thought Leader and a popular Science blogger with 1 million readers per month.

If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. There’s plenty of life in the Meta Quest 2 headset, despite newer versions coming on the market from the VR market leader. Which makes this deal from Amazon very, very intriguing. Right now the Meta Quest 2 is just £199, which is a $50 saving on the £249 asking price. Meta Quest 2 is a great buy at under £200 The Meta Quest 2 is a brilliant VR headset with planet of gas left in the tank. You can now grab one for £199 – a £50 saving – at Amazon.
 The Meta Quest 2 is a brilliant VR headset with planet of gas left in the tank. You can now grab one for £199 – a £50 saving – at Amazon. You’ll get the 128GB version of the Meta Quest 2, which is Amazon’s best selling VR headset, plus a pair of the Touch controllers. It ships with the glasses spacer, silicone cover, power adapter, power cable and even a couple of double A batteries. The VR headset gives you free range of motion in VR thanks to the built-in battery that lasts a couple of hours. You can set out a virtual playing space boundary to ensure you’re not crashing into the furniture. The processors are still rapid and the displays are excellent value for the expenditure, with very little of that motion sickness inducing latency between your head movement and the images on screen. There’s a huge library of titles for you to explore, plus the ability to enjoy a giant theatre for gaming both through VR in SteamVR or in 2D with Xbox Game Pass or watching movies through Netflix. We remain massive fans of the Meta Quest 2, giving it a five-star score for its fantastic wireless performance, great screen resolution, massive library of games and the affordable price. Is the VR headset still worth a buy in 2023? The all-in-one design is critical, especially with Apple requiring users to carry the battery around with the Vision Pro, while the hand tracking is accurate enabling you to move through the interface without controllers. Our reviewer said you should buy if “you want an all-in-one VR headset”. He says: “The Meta Quest 2 is one of the only headsets that can function both independently and connected to a gaming PC (with the required cable), ensuring a huge and varied library of games from both Meta’s own digital store and SteamVR.”

Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest detailed in fun new CT scans,2024-04-09T18:15:58+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97435/apple-vision-pro-and-meta-quest-detailed-in-fun-new-ct-scans/index.html,"The Apple Vision Pro is the hottest ticket in town right now, but it isn't the only headset that people are talking about. The Meta Quest Pro is a solid mixed reality headset while the Meta Quest 3 is more about that VR experience. All three are impressive in their own rights, and it's always interesting to know what they look like on the inside. What makes them tick. And now we know after Lumafield put all three headsets through a CT scanner to get a non-intrusive look at their innards. The video that you can see below shows off all of the headsets in their various glories and most attention will no doubt be on the Apple Vision Pro. The headset is a minimalist design on the outside, but things definitely get serious on the inside. The Apple Vision Pro makes the most of its internal space by using a flexible PCB ribbon and moving all of the various electronics around so that they are positioned at various angles so every last inch of space is used to its fullest. Notably, the Meta headsets chose to stack the elements instead, an approach that is more akin to phones, tablets, and laptops. Other notable aspects of the Apple Vision Pro include the various sensors that are included with the LiDAR and IR cameras standing out. They're vital for Apple's hand-tracking capabilities, something that needed to be right before launch due to the lack of any controllers - unlike the Meta products. The Apple Vision Pro might be expensive, but it's easy to see why when we see the CT scan. Starting at $3,499 the headset is the most expensive of the bunch, but there is no denying that it is an impressive bit of kit in terms of the way it looks from the outside and the way Apple has managed to cram so much technology into such a small space, The headset is heavy, but it isn't overlay large. Apple will hope that it can iterate quickly, of course. A future Apple Vision Pro could well cost less, although it isn't clear how Apple intends to make that happen - will it use cheaper components, remove features, or just hope that the economies of scale make the price more affordable? The Apple Vision Pro is currently only available in the United States and its high starting price ensures that only a select few will be able to justify spending the money on what, right now, is a fledgling product.

Meta Downplays AI Disinformation Threat In Big Election Year,2024-04-09T17:06:35+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/meta-leaders-say-they-re-not-seeing-ai-election-disinformation,"(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is under immense pressure to ensure that social media content created by artificial intelligence doesn’t cause havoc with elections this year. The company’s top leaders say they haven’t seen that happen yet on their services. “So far, it’s been very striking how little these tools have been used on a systemic basis to try to subvert or disrupt these elections,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said at an event on the company’s AI strategy in London on Tuesday.  There’s still time for that to change. The rapid spread of AI tools capable of generating realistic images, videos or audio clips coincides with a key global election year, with about half the world’s population headed to the polls in 2024. Experts fear that AI-generated content could mislead voters or seed disinformation on social media, citing incidents like fake audio of US President Joe Biden circulating to 20,000 voters in New Hampshire in January. Last week, Meta announced plans to label all AI-generated content on Facebook and its other properties – even if that material isn’t generated using Meta’s own AI tools. Clegg said he was “quietly optimistic” about the technology sector agreeing on standards for moderating AI-generated media. “We should be vigilant,” he added. “But I would urge us to think of AI as a great tool to navigate this.” Read More: AI Is Making Politics Easier, Cheaper and a Lot More Dangerous On Tuesday, Clegg and other senior executives touted the company’s range of AI models, incorporated into products from Instagram to augmented Ray-Ban glasses. Meta has been a steadfast proponent of open-source AI. Releasing such technology freely, Clegg said, ensures that AI is not just kept “in the clammy hands of a small number of well-heeled companies in California.”  A new version of Meta’s flagship model, Llama, will arrive “within the next month, hopefully less,” Clegg added. The executives also stressed Meta’s potential to weave AI chatbots into more products. “In the near future, every single one of our interactions will be mediated through an AI assistant,” Yann LeCun, Meta’s chief scientist, said on stage while donning the company’s Ray-Bans. Meta’s labeling policy would extend to these features, according to Chris Cox, its chief product officer. Any texts with chatbots on WhatsApp would be clearly labeled as conversations with AI, he said. But Cox added that AI-generated media was “still de minimis” on the feeds of Facebook and Instagram.

You can now lie down while using a Meta Quest 3 headset,2024-04-09T16:45:56+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/you-can-now-lie-down-while-using-a-meta-quest-3-headset-164556039.html?src=rss,"Meta is rolling out the latest update for Meta Quest and, as always, there are some handy features. From now on, whenever you're livestreaming to the Meta Quest app, the broadcast will continue when you take the headset off. That should help avoid interruptions. There are some Quest 3-specific upgrades too, including the ability to use an external mic via the USB-C port, along with resolution and image quality improvements for the passthrough mixed reality feature. That's not all, though. Quest 3 users will be able to take advantage of an experimental feature that allows them to make use of the headset while supine. If you enable the Use Apps While Lying Down option from the Experimental section of the Settings, you'll simply need to hold the menu button to reset your view when you lie down. As such, you should be able to kick back and relax into immersive media and gaming experiences without having to keep your head upright. Turning your head to see what's going on elsewhere in the environment might be a bit more of a chore though. Elsewhere, it'll now be easier to meet up with friends in Horizon Worlds, if any of your friends actually use that app. Whenever a buddy is in a public world with their location turned on, you can join them from the People app in the universal menu.

Meta may release smaller Llama AI model before the big version,2024-04-09T15:37:51+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125217/meta-llama-smaller-lightweight-model-ai,"By  Emilia David, a reporter who covers AI. Prior to joining The Verge, she covered the intersection between technology, finance, and the economy. Meta will reportedly release smaller versions of its Llama language model as companies look to offer more cost-effective AI models to the public.  The Information reports that the company plans to launch two small Llama 3 versions this month before putting out the flagship model this summer. The Verge reached out to Meta for comment.  The move underscores the growing trend of AI developers adding lightweight AI model options. Meta already has a smaller version of its Llama 2 model, Llama 2 7B, which it launched in February last year. Google came out with the Gemma family of models in February, and the French AI company Mistral also has Mistral 7B.  These models typically cannot handle long strings of instructions from users but are faster, more flexible, and, most importantly, cheaper to run than a regular-sized model. But these are still powerful AI models, able to summarize PDFs and conversations and write code. Larger models are usually used for more complicated tasks like generating photos or tasks that require several commands to execute. Since small models only work with a smaller number of parameters (data that it learns), these also require less computing power and, therefore, are more cost-effective.  Lightweight models tend to attract users who don’t necessarily want to use the breadth of a large language model for their applications. Smaller models can most often be deployed in specific projects like code assistance or in devices that cannot handle the power usage of a bigger AI model, like phones or laptops.  Meta reportedly plans a July release for Llama 3, which may be “looser” than the previous version and be able to answer controversial questions Llama 2 was not allowed to answer.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Meta confirms that its Llama 3 open-source LLM is coming in the next month,2024-04-09T15:08:17+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/meta-confirms-that-its-llama-3-open-source-llm-is-coming-in-the-next-month/,"At an event in London on Tuesday, Meta confirmed that it plans an initial release of Llama 3 — the next generation of its large language model used to power generative AI assistants — within the next month. This confirms a report published on Monday by The Information that Meta was getting close to launch. “Within the next month, actually less, hopefully in a very short period of time, we hope to start rolling out our new suite of next-generation foundation models, Llama 3,” said Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs. He described what sounds like the release of several different iterations or versions of the product. “There will be a number of different models with different capabilities, different versatilities [released] during the course of this year, starting really very soon.” The plan, Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox added, will be to power multiple products across Meta with Llama 3. Meta has been scrambling to catch up to OpenAI, which took it and other big tech companies like Google by surprise when it launched ChatGPT over a year ago and the app went viral, turning generative AI questions and answers into everyday, mainstream experiences. Meta has largely taken a very cautious approach with AI, but that hasn’t gone over well with the public, with previous versions of Llama criticized as too limited. (Llama 2 was released publicly in July 2023. The first version of Llama was not released to the public, yet it still leaked online.) Llama 3, which is bigger in scope than its predecessors, is expected to address this, with capabilities not just to answer questions more accurately but also to field a wider range of questions that might include more controversial topics. It hopes this will make the product catch on with users. “Our goal over time is to make a Llama-powered Meta AI be the most useful assistant in the world,” said Joelle Pineau, vice president AI Research. “There’s quite a bit of work remaining to get there.” The company did not talk about the size of the parameters it’s using in Llama 3, nor did it offer any demos of how it would work. It’s expected to have about 140 billion parameters, compared to 70 billion for the biggest Llama 2 model. Most notably, Meta’s Llama families, built as open source products, represent a different philosophical approach to how AI should develop as a wider technology. In doing so, Meta is hoping to play into wider favor with developers versus more proprietary models. But Meta is also playing it more cautiously, it seems, especially when it comes to other generative AI beyond text generation. The company is not yet releasing Emu, its image generation tool, Pineau said. “Latency matters a lot along with safety along with ease of use, to generate images that you’re proud of and that represent whatever your creative context is,” Cox said. Ironically — or perhaps predictably (heh) — even as Meta works to launch Llama 3, it does have some significant generative AI skeptics in the house. Ya...",2

The Meta Quest 3 headset has a lying down mode now,2024-04-09T13:43:13+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125090/meta-quest-3-v64-software-update-lying-down-mode-passthrough-video-external-microphone,"By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Thanks to the latest software update for the Meta Quest 3, Meta’s newest headset now has the lying down mode that came to the Quest 2 and Pro headsets last month. A Meta community post says the update began rolling out to the Quest headsets on Monday.  To try it out, go to Settings > Experimental and toggle Use Apps While Lying Down. This should be a nice feature for when you just want to get prone and watch a movie — something the much more expensive Apple Vision Pro could do at launch. But it’s also a boon for those who have health problems and aren’t able to stay upright for long periods of time while using their Quest device. The feature was in the v53 software beta last year but was removed before the update rolled out. In addition to letting users lay prone while they’re jacked in, Meta says it has improved passthrough for the Quest 3. The company says it optimized its passthrough video to make “perceived resolution” better — basically, fine-grained text like that on a smartphone should be more legible. The company says it’s also improved color, exposure, contrast, and dynamic range, so what you see will match real-world colors better, and it says low-light passthrough is less grainy with the update. The Quest 3 also now supports external microphones through the headset’s USB-C port and should support non-USB-C mics with adapters. To use it, users will need to switch by going to Settings > Experimental and choosing the microphone there.  Finally, for all headsets, Meta’s update will now let streamers using the Meta Quest app keep their streams going when they take their headset off, rather than the screen going black. The company also says it’s testing a feature in Horizon Worlds that will let users join friends who are sharing their location and in a public world directly from the People app in the universal menu.  Again, the update only started rolling out yesterday — so if you don’t have it quite yet, hold your virtual horses because it’s on its way.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Negli ultimi tempi viene rivalutata la figura del derviscio Khwaja Ahmad Tasavi, predicatore islamico e poeta Sufi, il cui mausoleo è meta di grandi pellegrinaggi. Oggi cerca di affiancare le dimensioni futuriste all’eredità del passato. Turkestan (AsiaNews) - Una serie di manifestazioni di propaganda culturale e pubblicitaria stanno esaltando in questi giorni il fascino particolare della città di Turkestan, presentata come “centro spirituale del Kazakistan”. Definita anche “la perla della Via della Seta”, Turkestan è una delle città più antiche non soltanto del Kazakistan, ma di tutta l’Asia centrale, di cui intende rappresentare non soltanto “il glorioso passato, ma anche il dinamico presente e le prospettive del futuro”, come scritto in un servizio di CentralAsia. Fondata nel 490 d.C., la città raggiunse la sua massima fioritura nel XII secolo. Circondata da possenti mura e torri di guardia, Turkestan divenne il centro amministrativo per molti signori e comandanti centrasiatici, delle dinastie dei corasmici, mongoli, timuridi e šajbanidi, per diventare poi la capitale del Khanato kazaco tra il XVI e il XVIII secolo. Luogo di incontro tra la cultura nomade e quella stanziale, ma anche d’incrocio tra le rotte commerciali, a Turkestan si svolgevano le più solenni cerimonie di intronizzazione dei khan, alla presenza dei rappresentanti di molti altri Stati. In più occasioni negli ultimi tempi viene rivalutata la figura del derviscio Khwaja Ahmad Tasavi, vissuto nel XII secolo e a cui a fine ‘300 fu dedicato un grande mausoleo sulla sua tomba, nel territorio del museo Khazret-sultan, il suo titolo letterario. Filosofo centrasiatico, predicatore islamico e poeta Sufi, scrisse opere nella lingua uigura della prima dinastia musulmana della regione, quella dei Karakhanidi, a cui fanno riferimento le popolazioni turaniche di tutta l’Asia, fino allo Xinjiang cinese. Il mausoleo oggi è meta di grandi pellegrinaggi, che se ripetuti almeno tre volte vengono equiparati a quello canonico alla Mecca, facendo di Turkestan un vero santuario islamico. Accanto alla sacra tomba di Tasavi sono stati collocati diversi musei e imponenti edifici, recentemente restaurati e riorganizzati come il Koltobe e la moschea Khuma, e anche le moschee “sotterranee” di Aulye Kumšyk e Khilbet e il complesso rituale Šildekhan, insieme a una sauna orientale nella cittadella medievale, il cosiddetto Šakhristan, la “città nella città” dentro le mura. Altri mausolei sono dedicati ai khan e ai potenti della storia locale, formando un complesso di oltre 100 monumenti storici e archeologici di grande rilevanza, con oltre 25 mila oggetti in esposizione, compresi manoscritti, progetti architettonici e antiche monete, visitati ogni anno da oltre 350mila turisti, senza contare i pellegrini. La ricostruzione di Turkestan, iniziata nei decenni del governo del presidente Nursultan Nazarb...",0

"Meta’s X competitor Threads invites developers to sign up for API access, publishes docs",2024-04-08T20:43:05+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/08/metas-x-competitor-threads-invites-developers-to-sign-up-for-api-access-publishes-docs/,"After opening its developer API to select companies for testing in March, Meta’s Twitter/X competitor Threads is now introducing developer documentation and a sign-up sheet for interested parties ahead of the API’s public launch, planned for June. The new documentation details the API’s current limitations and its endpoints, among other things, which could help developers get started on their Threads-connected apps and any other projects that integrate with the new social network. For instance, those who want to track analytics around Threads’ posts can use an Insights API to retrieve things like views, likes, replies, reposts, and quotes. There are also details on how to publish posts and media via the API, retrieve replies, and a series of troubleshooting tips. The documentation indicates that Threads accounts are limited to 250 API-published posts within a 24-hour period and 1,000 replies — a measure to counteract spam or other excessive use. It also offers the image and video specifications for media uploaded with users’ posts and notes that Threads’ text post character counts have a hard limit of 500 characters — longer than old Twitter’s 280 characters, but far less than the 25,000 characters X offers to paid subscribers or the now 100,000 characters it permits in articles posted directly to its platform. Whether or not Meta will ultimately favor certain kinds of apps over others remains to be seen. So far, Threads API beta testers have included social tool makers like Sprinklr, Sprout Social, Social News Desk, Hootsuite, and tech news board Techmeme. Although Threads has begun its integration with the wider fediverse — the network of interconnected social networking services that includes Mastodon and others — it doesn’t appear that fediverse sharing can be enabled or disabled through the API itself. Instead, users still have to visit their settings in the Threads app to publish to the fediverse. Meta says the new documentation will be updated over time as it gathers feedback from developers. In addition, anyone interested in building with the new API and providing feedback can now request access via a sign-up page — something that could also help Meta track the apps that are preparing to go live alongside the API’s public launch.",2
