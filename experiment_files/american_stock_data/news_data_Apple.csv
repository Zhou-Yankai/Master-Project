Apple’s Vision Pro headset launches next month as company seeks to expand mixed-reality market,2024-01-08T23:43:34+00:00,https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/01/08/apples-vision-pro-headset-launches-next-month-as-company-seeks-to-expand-mixed-reality-market/,"E-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters E-Edition 
			Trending:		 Apple’s high-priced headset for toggling between the real and digital world will be available in its stores beginning Feb. 2, launching the trendsetting company’s push to broaden the appeal of what so far has been a niche technology. Apple unveiled the sleek $3,500 goggles at a software conference held at its Cupertino, California, headquarters eight months ago — an event that was designed to encourage developers to make apps tailored for a device that projects users into three-dimensional simulations of reality. Apple’s announcement coincides with a major consumer electronics show in Las Vegas where the company has long been conspicuously absent. Apple says the goggles’ operating system will be compatible with more than 1 million apps designed for the iPhone and iPad. Pre-orders begin Jan. 19, but buyers will have to go to a store to be properly fitted for the goggles, which are controlled with the eyes and a few simple hand gestures. Although Facebook owner Meta Platforms and other companies have been making virtual reality headsets for years with limited success, many industry analysts believe Apple has the potential to expand the technology’s audience beyond the video gamers and mostly tech nerds that have embraced it so far. The Vision Pro already has gotten largely enthusiastic reviews among the media who were able to test it in tightly controlled demonstrations monitored by Apple, but the device’s price tag probably means relatively few unit sales during its first year on the market. Even so, Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch debut a decade ago could set the stage for the introduction of more affordable versions for a broader audience. Right now, the Vision Pro will cost seven times more than Meta’s latest virtual-reality headset, the Quest 3. In a sign that Apple is expecting the Vision Pro to pave the way to a bigger market, the company included the ability to take 3-D videos that can be viewed through the goggles on its its latest premium iPhones, the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. These videos are so realistic that the people and other images in them appear to be right in front of the viewer watching them. Apple is looking for ways to juice its sales after suffering a slight decline in revenue during its last fiscal year ending in in September. Apple still raked in $383 billion in sales, with the iPhone accounting for more than half that amount. Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group",2
How Much Will The Apple Vision Pro Cost?,2024-01-08T22:59:16+00:00,https://uproxx.com/technology/how-much-will-the-apple-vision-pro-cost/,"As the tech giant tends to do every year, Apple revealed a sweet new gadget for its loyal consumers last June at its Worldwide Developer Conference. The Apple Vision Pro was unveiled as the company’s first step into the VR headset industry. The product delivers a 4K display for each eye which lets users switch between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Navigation with the headset can be done without a controller thanks to the Vision Pro’s ability to track the eyes, head, and hands. Users will be able to use FaceTime, watch movies, view photos and so much more with the headset. With these cool features and so much more, what does the price tag look like for the Apple Vision Pro? Today, Apple announced that the Apple Vision Pro would begin shipping to users on February 2 with Pre-orders for the headset beginning on Friday, January 19, at 8 am EST/5 am PST. The price tag for the Apple Vision Pro is a whopping $3,499 which is more than the newest version of the iPhone and most editions of the MacBook laptops. The $3,499 price tag is also just for the base model. In partnership with Zeiss, Apple will also offer prescription lenses for the Apple Vision Pro. Readers will be an extra $99 and prescription lenses will be an extra $149. The base model of the Apple Vision Pro offers 256 GB of storage and comes with the following: Solo Knit and Dual Loop Bands, a light seal and two light seal cushions, an Apple Vision Pro cover, a polishing cloth, a battery, and a USB-C charging cable and USB-C power adapter.

Samsung renews its green cred at CES,2024-01-08T22:41:49+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/08/new-year-greener-samsung/,"We’ve heard “reduce, reuse, recycle” used ad nauseam, but at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, Samsung follows in Apple’s footsteps, doubling down on that, dedicating a significant amount of its keynote speech to underscoring its commitment to sustainability. The company is specifically expanding its efforts toward resource circularity, from the design of its devices to how they’re used and, ultimately, how they’re reused or recycled. The company has embraced recycled materials in some of its most popular products. “We start by incorporating recycled materials into some of our most loved products, such as recycled fishing nets in our Galaxy,” said Inhee Chung, VP of corporate sustainability at Samsung. “Smartphones, recycled plastic in our TVs and recycled aluminum in our bespoke refrigerators. Recycled plastic accounted for 14% of the total plastic used in our products in 2022. And we’re working towards increasing this amount.” CES 2024: Samsung’s bigger, foldier, more rollable displays  Beyond the manufacturing process, Samsung is also considering the environmental impact of their products during use. Innovative features like SmartThings AI Energy Mode can help consumers manage energy at home by using connected intelligence. According to Samsung’s data, the number of SmartThings energy users worldwide has increased by more than 75% in 2023 (although the company didn’t specify the base number for that, so who knows if that’s as impressive as it sounds.) Samsung has also announced the integration of SmartThings energy with Tesla’s Powerwall solar inverter and Wall Connector EV charging solutions. This collaboration means that SmartThings energy can enable Tesla Powerwall Storm Watch to notify users before a severe weather event and help prepare for power outages by activating energy-saving automation. Perhaps the most interesting initiative shown off at the press conference today was the company’s commitment to sustainability beyond end-of-life use. The company prioritizes reuse and recycling, offering refurbished phones through programs like 35 Renewed, and the Galaxy Upcycling initiative, which helps users reuse or repurpose old phones. One way that shows up is that the company has partnered with the D-Lab at MIT to develop new ways to upcycle Samsung devices and divert them from becoming electronic waste. The collaboration aims to create a transformative impact in low-income communities in Africa, where the impact of e-waste is most acutely felt. Samsung’s Galaxy S24 lineup set for January 17 debut  Today’s press conference gave me some hope that Samsung’s commitment to a low-carbon circular economy goes beyond lip service. From the design of their products to their end-of-life, Samsung is proving that tech companies can embrace sustainability and environmental responsibility. The tech giant is not only innovating in its product line but also in its environmental footprint, making strides toward a greener and more sustainable future. Could they be doing ...",0
XReal Believes Its $700 AR Glasses Can Top the Apple Vision Pro,2024-01-08T22:25:00+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/xreal-ar-glasses-apple-vision-pro-1851149687,"XReal just revealed its Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses and seems pretty confident about them being the perfect alternative to the Apple Vision Pro. Unlike Apple’s painfully expensive $3500 spatial computer headset, the Air 2 Ultra will just set you back $700. They’re also quite decent-looking thanks to a titanium ring frame and a modern, Wayfarer-esque design. XReal’s latest glasses succeed the XReal Air 2 and Air 2 Pro, mainly focusing on spatial computing. Embedding a pair of 3D environment sensors with computer vision capabilities, they provide real-time location and mapping intel. Apparently, these are the smallest sensors on the market and enable a couple of 3D mesh creations and semantic scene understandings. XReal seems really insistent upon the fact that these beat the Vision Pro. It claims that its “advanced proprietary optical engine” allows you to enjoy an HD experience with a FOV (field-of-view) that is higher than that of the Cupertino company’s headset. The Air 2 Ultra peaks at a refresh rate of 120Hz and a brightness of 500 nits.  Another feature—more like a reason not to sell your kidney for the  Vision Pro—that Xreal talks about is the Air 2 Ultra’s support for Apple’s latest spatial video feature. You can film spatial videos with your iPhone 15 Pro, convert them to a regular format, and play them on these glasses.  The company also boasts the titanium glass frame, which it claims is a first for the AR glasses industry. I have to admit that it gives it a premium and sturdy look, and seeing that it still weighs merely 80 grams, I think it’s a pretty good choice of material.  The Air 2 Ultra will start shipping in March 2024, but you can pre-order them starting today. They ship with Xreal’s latest NRSDK 2.2, which offers better hand tracking and hand gesture recognition compared to its predecessor. As for compatibility, the glasses work with a bunch of platforms,  including but not limited to Mac and Windows Laptops, Samsung Android phones, and iPhone 15.

Mophie resurrects the Juice Pack for the iPhone 15 series,2024-01-08T22:07:13+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/mophie-resurrects-the-juice-pack-for-the-iphone-15-series-220713020.html?src=rss,"Mophie’s Juice Pack, once practically synonymous with smartphone battery cases, is making a comeback at CES 2024. With Apple having discontinued its MagSafe Battery Pack as part of its purge of Lightning accessories, the Zagg-owned Mophie has seized the moment to reintroduce the Juice Pack for the first time in five years. The new version of the battery case is designed for the iPhone 15 series (with the notable exception of the 15 Plus). The battery capacity in the new Juice Pack varies depending on which iPhone model you have. The iPhone 15 version has a 2,400mAh battery, the iPhone 15 Pro model moves to 2,600mAh and the iPhone 15 Pro Max variant is 2,800mAh. The case supports passthrough charging and will prioritize the iPhone when both need power. Mophie’s iPhone 15 and 15 Pro cases have identical external dimensions (despite the phones’ measurements being different) at 161 x 75 x 17.54mm (6.3 x 3 x 0.7 inch). Meanwhile, the iPhone 15 Pro Max version measures 174 x 81.1 x 17.12 mm (6.85 x 3.2 x 0.67 inch). The case is made from acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and has slightly raised corners to help with drop protection. The Mophie Juice Pack for iPhone 15 series costs $100. The battery case will be available for pre-order in late February from Mophie’s website.

iPhone 15: 5 Things to Consider Before You Buy,2024-01-08T22:05:19+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/iphone-15-things-to-consider-before-you-buy/,"Published on By Thinking about buying an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max? Here are the main things to consider before you upgrade. Everyone’s situation is a bit different, but we’ve put together a list of the top five items to cross off your checklist before you purchase an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max. Table of Contents If you consider all of these things before you buy, you shouldn’t suffer from buyers remorse in the weeks or months ahead.  First, and perhaps foremost, you’ll want to decide how much storage you’ll need. This shouldn’t take very long, but it’s an extremely important step because it could potentially save you money. Apple offers an iPhone 15 storage option for everyone, ranging from 128GB to a whopping 1TB of storage. While a lot of people will be perfectly fine with the least or most amount of storage, many others will want something in between. Before you decide on one storage size or another, you’ll want to examine two things: The amount of storage you’re currently using on your phone and your habits. You might be using your current phone to simply browse the internet or contact friends, but your habits might change when you upgrade to one of Apple’s powerful flagships. Maybe you’ll play more games, use more apps, or perhaps you’ll start to shoot a lot of high-resolution photos and videos. These will take up space. We’ve put together a guide that goes over all of the iPhone 15 storage options and it makes recommendations based on how you might use your phone. Start there, and if you need additional help, don’t be afraid to peruse the web for more advice.  Some of you might want to use this time to examine your data plan and/or carrier. If you’re unhappy with your current provider, here are a few things you’ll want to dig into before you buy. Dig into the competition. If you’re on Verizon, you’ll want to take a look at carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile. Research their data plans and their coverage in your area. You might be able to find a better fit for you and your new iPhone. If you plan to stay on your current carrier you’ll want to use this upgrade as an excuse to peruse the latest data plans. You might find a plan that better suits your needs and there’s even a chance you’ll be able to save yourself some money.  The base iPhone 15 models come in more colors than the iPhone 15 Pro models. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are extremely colorful while the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro colors are less flashy and muted. Apple’s also done away with the familiar gold option. If you plan to use a case with your new iPhone 15, you’ll want to think about what color case you’ll use. You’ll also want to think about the case’s design. You might want to select the color that best aligns with the case you’ll be using. Some of you ultimately might decide the color of your new device doesn’t matter since a case will be covering up most of the phone’s color. That being said, y...",1
Moment furious father gets out of his car and confronts anti-Israel protesters blockading Williamsburg Bridge and tells them he needs to 'get to his daughter' - as NYPD arrest 325 for causing havoc across Big Apple,2024-01-08T21:40:56+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12940347/Brooklyn-Bridge-New-York-Israel-Palestine-protests-angry-father.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By Nic White and Claudia Aoraha For Dailymail.Com   Published:  21:16, 8 January 2024   |  Updated:  09:33, 9 January 2024      1.1k View  comments  A furious father was caught on camera confronting pro-Palestinian protesters blocking Williamsburg Bridge as he desperately tried to get home to his daughter.    New York was besieged by hundreds of demonstrators who blocked all major vehicle routes in and out of the city for more than an hour on Monday - leading to 325 arrests across the Big Apple. The coordinated action hit the Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, and Holland Tunnel, stopping traffic out of Manhattan. One man trapped on the Williamsburg  Bridge lost his patience when masked protesters stood in front of his Honda SUV and refused to let him pass.

'You're disrupting traffic, idiots. You can't do that, that's against the law,' he shouted, then gave up and got out of the car to confront them directly. 'I'm gonna have to start throwing fists at y'all, I'm not gonna run you over... get away from my car.' The man shoved three male protesters standing directly in front of his car, pushing one of them a second time when he moved back in place. The hi-vis woman tried to defuse the situation as the man stopped pushing and screamed: 'Get away from my car, I have a daughter in Brooklyn.' Officers rounded up the cuffed protesters and lined them up in single file before hoisting them onto a MTA bus to be processed BROOKLYN BRIDGE: Protesters have blocked Brooklyn Bridge in Manhattan this morning - as they called to 'lift the siege on Gaza' Brooklyn Bridge, which connects downtown Manhattan to Dumbo in Brooklyn, is swarmed by police arresting the protesters on Monday BROOKLYN BRIDGE: Three demonstrators, wearing face coverings, are led off the bridge on Monday afternoon Perhaps egged on by bystanders calling for him to run the protesters over, he got back behind the wheel and started inching forward.

How to Fix iPhone 14 Performance Problems,2024-01-08T21:35:47+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/how-to-fix-iphone-14-performance-problems/,"Published on By We’re getting feedback from those who have adopted Apple’s iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max. A lot of the feedback is good, but we’ve also heard about performance problems like stuttering, lockups, and lag. If your iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, or iPhone 14 Pro Max freezes or lags, you don’t need to get in touch with Apple customer service just yet. You may be able to fix your issue(s) in a matter of minutes.  This walkthrough will take you through solutions for performance problems that have worked for us in the past. They’ll also help you maintain a fast, and efficient, iPhone 14 well into the future. Table of Contents If you start running into performance issues on your iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, or iPhone 14 Pro Max, try restarting your device. Often times, a quick reboot will alleviate the problems. Power down your device, leave it off for 30 seconds or so, and then power it back on and see if performance improves. If it doesn’t, you’ll want to try the solutions below. Apple will push out new iOS 17 software throughout the year. Point updates (iOS x.x.x) are almost always focused on fixing bugs while milestone upgrades (iOS x.x) typically deliver a mix of new features and bug fixes. The company may not call out performance fixes in an iOS 17 update’s change log, but new software always has the potential to help (or hurt) your iPhone 14’s overall performance. For more on the latest version of iOS 17, check out our guide. Try updating the applications on your iPhone to the latest version if an update is available on the App Store.  App developers are rolling out support updates and they could help stabilize the app and/or your iPhone 14’s overall performance. Before you install the latest version of an app, make sure you dig into reviews from other iPhone 14 and iOS 17 users. If the reviews are mostly good, download the latest version. You might also try resetting your iPhone 14’s settings. This will restore your device’s settings to their factory defaults so make sure you have your Wi-Fi passwords handy. You’ll need to re-enter them when the process finishes up. This could take a few seconds to complete so remain patient. If you transferred files from an old phone to your iPhone 14, you might have a lot of clutter taking up space on your phone’s internal storage. Getting rid of these unused files and apps could help improve your device’s performance. You’ll want to check and see how much space is available on your iPhone 14. Here’s how to do that: If you’re getting close to reaching the storage threshold, you’ll want to head back into General and go to where it says iPhone Storage. This will show you a detailed rundown of your data. Apple will make some recommendations based on the utilization of your device’s storage, but you can also just go through each section manually delete files you no longer need. Clearing your browser’s cookies and data will free up memory whic...",-2
How To Manage Your Apple Watch Activity Rings,2024-01-08T21:15:53+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1486700/how-to-manage-apple-watch-activity-rings/,"
The Apple Watch is a companion to your iPhone, letting you answer incoming calls, send texts, and view app notifications. It's also a pretty powerful device on its own. While all Apple Watches can track your heart rate, if you have an Apple Watch Series or Apple Watch Ultra model, you'll also be able to keep tabs on blood oxygen, record an ECG, and monitor sleep.





In addition, the Apple Watch can send you notifications if it detects an irregular heart rate or your heartbeat is too high or low. Apart from its health specific features, the Apple Watch is also a great tool to help you track your workouts and daily activity. It does this using Activity rings — three concentric circles that provide a visual indicator of how close you are to hitting your daily goals.
Apple (and Apple Watch users) often use the term ""close your rings,"" which basically means hitting all your daily goals. Closing all three activity rings every single day isn't realistic for most people, but they are a simple and effective way to keep tabs on how much you've moving and exercising.

Closing all three activity rings every single day isn't realistic for most people, but they are a simple and effective way to keep tabs on how much you've moving and exercising. 
There are three activity rings: red, green, and blue. Each one denotes a specific goal that's designed to help you stay in shape. The rings start empty at the beginning of the day, progressively filling up as you get closer to your goal. The red ring is for your Move goal, which records active calories burned through the day. Active calories are the ones you burn through movement. While exercise is obviously a contributing factor, even other activities like walking to the store, doing housework, or playing with your kids are counted. These calories are automatically logged as you go about your day.





The green ring is your Exercise goal. You can close this ring by starting a workout in the Workout app, but any other brisk activity you do, such as walking or running, will also add to your exercise minutes. There are some days when yo...",2

 Rush frontman Geddy Lee has revealed that quite a few musicians made the “inappropriate” gesture of offering their drumming services to him shortly after the 2020 death of his band’s virtuosic drummer, Neil Peart. Lee commented about these incidents while discussing his 2023 memoir, My Effin’ Life, on a new episode of Apple Music’s literary-themed podcast Strombo’s Lit. “Oh yeah, I heard from all kinds [of people],” Lee told host George Stroumboulopoulos. “That was a very weird moment. My little black book got filled up really quickly.”  [RELATED: Rush’s Geddy Lee Releases Two Previously Unheard Solo Demos as New Docuseries Premieres] The 70-year-old Rock & Roll Hall of Famer added, “I was, like, ‘Whoa, that’s just so inappropriate right now. Dude, wait two months, at least two months, if ever.’” Lee also noted that drummers continue to reach out to him, particularly now that he recently has discussed the possibility of working with Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson again on new musical projects with various media outlets. “It still happens, now that the clickbait freaks are out there talking about Alex and I getting a new drummer and starting Rush again,” he said. Stroumboulopoulos then commented, “We can thank Paul McCartney for that, right?” The host was referencing a story Lee had told in a recent Rolling Stone interview about how he and Lifeson had met McCartney during rehearsals for the Taylor Hawkins tribute concert in London. While chatting, the Beatles legend had encouraged them to get back out and tour together again. “I would never say a bad word about Paul McCartney,” Lee told Stroumboulopoulos. “He is an amazing person.” Discussing his conversation with McCartney led Lee to share a recollection of a time when Robert Plant had lifted his spirits after Peart’s wife, Jacqueline, had died of cancer in 1998. The ex-Led Zeppelin singer had invited Lee and Lifeson to come to a concert by Plant and Jimmy Page in Toronto, but Lee had been considering staying at home. “Jackie had just passed away like a few days earlier, and I said, ‘I’m not coming to the show. We’re too f—ed up,’” Lee recalled. “[Plant] said, ‘No, look, I’ve been through grief. I’ve lost people close to me, and I’ve learned you have to get back to life. Getting back to life sooner is better than later.’ … [I]t’s not always so easy, but he was right, and we went. And it was amazing.”  See more Only members can comment. Become a member.

 The Vision Pro mixed reality headset will be heading to eyeballs on Feb. 2. Tech Reporter 
Apple may not be exhibiting at CES, the consumer tech mega-show taking place this week in Las Vegas, but that doesn’t mean the company is laying low. On the contrary, more than half a year since it introduced the Vision Pro at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, the company finally unveiled the ship date for its much-anticipated mixed reality headset on Monday. 
	According to the announcement, the $3,499 device will be released Feb. 2 for delivery and retail availability. The 256GB base model will come with a Solo Knit Band and Dual Loop Band, headset cover and light seals, in addition to battery, polishing cloth and USB-C charging kit. Two Zeiss lens options will also be available for readers at $99 or prescriptions at $149.

	The technology impressed reviewers, who had a chance to preview the unit in a hands-on session hosted by Apple last summer. The hardware boasts 4K displays and a dual-processor system across Apple silicon, with its M2 chip and a new one designed specifically for mixed reality wearables called the R1. Dedicated to tackling the data load from the sensors, cameras and microphones, the R1 was designed to beat back performance lag and reduce motion sickness — a common complaint that some users have about immersive or virtual environments.

 
	To ensure customers have plenty to look at from day one, the company developed its new visionOS operating system so that it works with most iOS and iPadOS apps, with no retrofitting necessary by app-makers. But if that’s not enough, the Apple TV app will also offer more than 150 3D titles via the Apple TV app.  
	Vision Pro was built for control and ease, allowing the user to switch between augmented reality and virtual reality with a hardware dial planted on the side. It also supports eye, head and hand tracking, and not merely incidentally. These are the primary ways of interacting. The system follows the eye to know where to focus, and registers finger gestures to select, akin to button presses. Apple is so committed to this that the package doesn’t even include nunchuks or controllers. 
	That’s a critical distinction from virtually every other major VR tech-maker. Some have been working on hand gestures, like Meta in its Quest headsets, but as secondary or experimental features only. Apple’s decision has been rather polarizing in the developer community, but well-heeled early adopters will soon be able to judge for themselves.

Apple’s Vision Pro mixed reality headset will go on sale in February,2024-01-08T20:11:38+00:00,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/apple-vision-pro-mixed-reality-171855253.html,"Apple’s mixed reality headset, Vision Pro, will go on sale for the first time in February, the technology giant has announced. Beginning in the US only at first, the device will launch at Apple Stores and online from Friday February 2, with pre-orders available from January 19. First announced last summer, Vision Pro is a wearable computer centred around a headset that overlays apps and software over the real world, in front of the wearer’s eyes, and is controlled by a user’s eyes, hands and voice. The headset features built-in speakers and attaches using an adjustable headband, while a wire leads from the device to a battery pack which sits in the user’s pocket, enabling users to move around while wearing it. Apple says it is designed to offer more immersive experiences in entertainment and gaming, as well as a new platform from which users can work and interact with others. Apple said the Vision Pro will start at 3,499 dollars (£2,742), which is several times the price of the Meta Quest 3, the leading virtual reality headset from Facebook’s parent company, which is sold for 499 dollars (£390). The tech giant has not yet confirmed a release date for the Vision Pro in any countries outside the US. Apple said Vision Pro will include an all-new App Store, with access to more than one million compatible apps for this new way of interacting with technology, which Apple calls spatial computing. “The era of spatial computing has arrived,” Apple boss Tim Cook said. “Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore.” The weeks before 33-year-old Esther Beukema died were the happiest of her adult life.

 Apple TV, Amazon MGM Studios with Vanity Fair, W magazine and Billboard all hosted bashes during Golden Globes weekend. 
	“It’s heavy,” said Elizabeth Debicki, handing her Golden Globes trophy to partner Kristian Rasmussen. She took home best supporting actress in a drama for her portrayal of the late Princess Diana in Netflix’s “The Crown.” He had just taken off his jacket and put it around her bare shoulders, her Dior gown sparkling underneath. 
	“The color is antique silver, which I love,” she told WWD on the red carpet. 
	The two were now in the packed lobby of the Beverly Hilton — which was quite the scene moments after the show wrapped, with a who’s who of Hollywood faces all around.

	Jennifer Lawrence slipped off her black pumps with relief, walking barefoot. Leonardo DiCaprio smoked a vape in a corner. Sam Claflin and Elizabeth Banks hugged in long, warm embrace. Hunter Schafer squatted against a wall, people watching. Just in front of her, Jason Segel flashed a thumbs up for a selfie.

	








 
	“Where are you?” asked Naomi Watts while on her phone. 
	It was a herd of stars — in their finest gowns and tuxes — looking to make their way outside. Those who stayed inside, and there were few, headed to Billboard’s official after party. Held around the hotel pool, it was mostly the night’s winners who dropped in for photo ops and to make their rounds. There was the cast of “Beef,” which swept all three categories it was nominated in; it won best miniseries, with Steven Yeun and Ali Wong receiving best actor and actress. The same went for “The Bear,” with wins in best comedy, best actor for Jeremy Allen White and best actress for Ayo Edebiri. They, too, made an appearance. But it was Billie Eilish who turned heads, hard to miss with her fire-red punk hairdo and posse in tow. She was holding tightly to her globe, getting best original song for “Barbie” ballad “What Was I Made For?” It marks her and brother Finneas’ second Globes nomination and second win in the category.

 
	“How you doin’?” she asked, gleaming, to none other than Flavor Flav.  
	“Yeah boy,” the rapper shouted, with his signature clock-design bling around his neck. They hugged and laughed. 
	It was the last party of the weekend. W magazine kicked things off Friday with its annual best performances bash in the penthouse of Chateau Marmont. Saturday was packed, with Vanity Fair and Amazon MGM Studios’ Globes celebration at Bar Marmont.

Apple is going to offer Vision Pro demos at its retail stores,2024-01-08T19:18:43+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030346/apple-vision-pro-store-demo,"By  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium. Apple’s Vision Pro will officially launch in the US on February 2nd, and starting that same day, you’ll be able sign up to try the headset out for yourself at the company’s retail stores, Apple said in an email today. “Starting at 8:00 a.m. on Friday, February 2, we invite you to sign up for a demo of Apple Vision Pro at your local Apple Store,” Apple said in the email. “Demo times will be available Friday through the weekend on a first-come, first-served basis. We can’t wait to see you there.” That language kind of makes it sound like Apple will only be offering demos through that first weekend of launch. Personally, I doubt that will be the case — I’m guessing Apple will want to give lots of people opportunities to try the Vision Pro for themselves — but I’ve asked the company if it can clarify. (And I’ve already made a reminder to try to sign up for a test at my local Apple Store when February 2nd rolls around.)

Apple appeals after EU’s tough new DMA rules target App Store ,2024-01-08T19:17:26+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/23961923/apple-app-store-appeal-european-union-digital-markets-act-core-platform-service-gatekeeper,"By  Jon Porter, a reporter with five years of experience covering consumer tech releases, EU tech policy, online platforms, and mechanical keyboards. Apple is appealing a European Union decision that would see its App Store hit with tough new obligations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Reuters reports that its plea argues against the European Commission’s designations of its App Store and the iMessage service. According to Reuters, Apple argues that the Commission’s treatment of the App Stores on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch as a single store is based on “material factual errors,” as they all distribute apps for a specific platform and type of device.  As well as the App Store, the European Commission is also investigating whether iMessage should also be designated as a core platform service under the DMA, which could result in Apple being forced to make its messaging service interoperable with others. The Commission marked iMessage as a “number-independent interpersonal communications service” deserving investigation, and Reuters reports that Apple opposes that, saying it’s not fee-based or monetized by the sale of hardware or personal data.  In what is unlikely to be a coincidence, Apple recently announced iPhones will get support for RCS, a cross-platform standard pitched as the successor to SMS and MMS in 2024. Apple says it intends to support RCS “alongside iMessage” and will still use blue and green bubbles to distinguish between messaging standards. It is unclear what impact the announcement could have on the EU’s investigation into iMessage.  Being designated as a “core platform service” under the DMA would create a range of obligations for Apple with regards to its App Store. As this EU FAQ explains, gatekeepers (aka the companies that operate core platform services) are not allowed to favor their own products or services over rivals on their platforms, need to allow business users to promote services offered outside of the platform, and cannot force developers to use specific services like payment systems.  The rules have the potential to address key complaints from companies like Epic Games and Spotify about the way Apple operates its App Store. The iPhone maker recently said that its App Store has 123 million monthly active users in the EU in a disclosure relating to the EU’s separate-but-related Digital Services Act regulation.  When it announced its list of the DMA’s core platform services in early September, the European Commission also included Safari and iOS, which will impose similarly stringent obligations on Apple at the browser and OS level. Meta and TikTok have also filed cases contesting their DMA designations. Apple’s filing is the latest front in which the company is sparring with European regulators. It’s also involved in a long-running dispute over a €13 billion (around $14.1 billion) tax bill in Ireland, as well as investigations over Apple Pay and its App Store policies. Although it’s appealing th...",-2
2 Reasons to Pre-Order the Apple Vision Pro & 3 Reasons to Wait,2024-01-08T19:14:49+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/apple-vision-pro-pre-order-or-wait/,"Published on By There are some great reasons to pre-order the new Apple Vision Pro, but some shoppers might want to put the credit card away and wait. Apple’s finally confirmed the key dates for the Apple Vision Pro launch and the company’s new spatial computer is set to go on sale for the first time later this week.  The long-awaited device will officially go up for pre-order at Apple on Friday, January 19th. Pre-orders start at 5AM Pacific which means you might need to wake up early to get an order in. This is only for the United States. The device doesn’t have a release date in other regions though analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes it will launch internationally before WWDC 2024 in June. Kuo says Apple is starting in the United States for three reasons: the limited initial supply of Vision Pro, it wants to ensure the sales process in the U.S. market goes smoothly and it needs time “to modify the algorithms to comply with regulations in other countries.” The Apple Vision Pro is a brand new product which means there’s a ton of excitement around its arrival. The excitement, and potential shipping delays, are among the reasons why you might want to pre-order the device as soon as it goes on sale. If you can’t or simply don’t want to pre-order, the Apple Vision Pro will land in physical Apple Store locations in early February. The device’s release date is set for February 2nd. Table of Contents Buying the Apple Vision Pro right away might be tempting, but spending $3,499 (or more if Apple confirms additional storage options) on a first-generation device and a product you haven’t had a chance to try in person makes it a pretty tough decision. In this guide, we’ll help you decide if you should pre-order the Apple Vision Pro or wait until the dust settles. Simply put, if you want the Apple Vision Pro as soon as possible, you’ll want to put in a pre-order when they open up on the 19th.  We could see supply constraints impact Apple’s new device in the early going. Don’t be surprised if the shipping date gets pushed back relatively quickly after pre-orders open up. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has solid supply chain sources, believes this will indeed be the case. Kuo says thanks “to the demand from Apple’s core fans and heavy users, the Vision Pro should sell out soon after it is available for pre-order or sale, resulting in a longer shipping time.” In a follow-up, Kuo says he thinks “Apple will produce 60,000 to 80,000 units of Vision Pro for the February 2 release” and that it will “will sell out soon after the release.” If you want a guaranteed delivery on or around February 2nd, you’ll want to put in a pre-order through Apple shortly after pre-orders open up. If you don’t, and shipping times start to slip (or vanish completely), you’ll have to go into a store or wait. If you pass on a pre-order, but still want the Apple Vision Pro in your hands on or around February 2nd, you’ll need to head into a physical Apple Store location. We don’t expect lines wrap ar...",2

Apple’s Vision Pro headset launches next month as company seeks to expand mixed-reality market,2024-01-08T19:05:39+00:00,https://wtop.com/business-finance/2024/01/apples-vision-pro-headset-launches-next-month-as-company-seeks-to-expand-mixed-reality-market/,"
The Associated Press  January 8, 2024, 2:05 PM Apple’s high-priced headset for toggling between the real and digital world will be available in its stores beginning Feb. 2, launching the trendsetting company’s push to broaden the appeal of what so far has been a niche technology. Apple unveiled the sleek $3,500 goggles at a software conference held at its Cupertino, California, headquarters eight months ago — an event that was designed to encourage developers to make apps tailored for a device that projects users into three-dimensional simulations of reality.  Apple’s announcement coincides with a major consumer electronics show in Las Vegas where the company has long been conspicuously absent. Apple says the goggles’ operating system will be compatible with more than 1 million apps designed for the iPhone and iPad. Pre-orders begin Jan. 19, but buyers will have to go to a store to be properly fitted for the goggles, which are controlled with the eyes and a few simple hand gestures. Although Facebook owner Meta Platforms and other companies have been making virtual reality headsets for years with limited success, many industry analysts believe Apple has the potential to expand the technology’s audience beyond the video gamers and mostly tech nerds that have embraced it so far. The Vision Pro already has gotten largely enthusiastic reviews among the media who were able to test it in tightly controlled demonstrations monitored by Apple, but the device’s price tag probably means relatively few unit sales during its first year on the market.  Even so, Apple’s first new product since its smartwatch debut a decade ago could set the stage for the introduction of more affordable versions for a broader audience. Right now, the Vision Pro will cost seven times more than Meta’s latest virtual-reality headset, the Quest 3. In a sign that Apple is expecting the Vision Pro to pave the way to a bigger market, the company included the ability to take 3-D videos that can be viewed through the goggles on its its latest premium iPhones, the 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. These videos are so realistic that the people and other images in them appear to be right in front of the viewer watching them. Apple is looking for ways to juice its sales after suffering a slight decline in revenue during its last fiscal year ending in in September. Apple still raked in $383 billion in sales, with the iPhone accounting for more than half that amount. Copyright

TCL's NXTPAPER 14 Pro is somewhere between a tablet and a giant e-reader,2024-01-08T19:00:47+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/tcls-nxtpaper-14-pro-is-somewhere-between-a-tablet-and-a-giant-e-reader-190047895.html?src=rss,"TCL is going for different with its new pro tablet, revealed at CES 2024. There aren’t that many premium tablets beyond the annual updates from Apple and Samsung, and TCL plans to make its new 14- and 10-inch slates stand out with their display tech, featuring its next-gen NXTPAPER 3.0. It's aimed at striking a middle-ground between e-readers and tablets. It’s not about them being sharper or faster, but gentler on our very human eyes. The TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro’s display features heavily focus on eye comfort, with a new VersaView interface that can switch between a black-and-white reader mode and the standard tablet views. The 14-inch 2.8K display (2,880 x 1,800) features the company’s new NXTPAPER 3.0, aimed at better reflecting, literally, how the human eye reads natural paper, but on a digital display. NXTPAPER is TCL’s display tech that tries to offer a tablet experience with a paper-like reading surface. We’ve written about earlier iterations found in devices like the NXTPAPER 11 tablet and even some of its recent budget smartphones. The company says its next family of phones – no fewer than seven, including the TCL 50 XL NTXPAPER 5G and 50 XE NTXPAPER 5G – will also feature NXTPAPER 3.0 technology. The NXTPAPER 14 Pro is powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity 8020 chip, with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which is fine if unremarkable. It’s truly all about the screen. TCL says its NXTPAPER series continues to filter out up to 61 percent of blue light to ease the effects on users’ eyes. Version 3.0 is brighter, hitting 700 nits on the 14-inch matte display. A new Circularly Polarized Light (CPL) screen should also light up text more naturally, while being easier to read in sunlight. TCL claims this creates a reading experience closer to reading books in natural light. There’s also DC dimming, which should also lower flickering effects experienced on some lower-refresh rate screens. In tablet mode, the NXTPAPER 14 Pro can reach up to 120Hz refresh rates, and the new CPL tech also means it maintains legibility even if you’re wearing polarizing lenses. Meanwhile, the Tab 10 NXTPAPER 5G packs some of the same display technology (NXTPAPER 3.0) but on a 10.4-inch, 2K (2,560 x 1,440) screen. And no dedicated viewing mode button. It does, however, feature 5G support. To really make sure you get it, TCL also created an Eye Health Assistant to nag remind you to reduce screen brightness or perhaps not stare at your new tablet at midnight. The NXTPAPER 14 Pro also has a dedicated physical button for switching between three different viewing modes. The tablet’s VersaView UI means users can switch between a standard tablet mode and NXTPAPER mode. The latter is an e-ink style (but not e-ink!) monochrome mode, which rarely features on devices headed to the US. However, this isn’t just the tablet processing the Android interface into grayscale. The interface includes stripped-down icons, like line drawings, that can still be differentiated from each other and a lot...",-2

"Remember Apple’s MagSafe Duo wireless charger? Well, it’s 38% off",2024-01-08T18:37:52+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-magsafe-duo-charger-deal-woot-january-2024/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? If you’re browsing through Apple deals for accessories that you can buy for your iPhone or Apple Watch, you should check out this offer from Amazon’s Woot for the Apple MagSafe Duo Charger. Originally priced at $130, it’s on sale with a 38% discount that reduces its price to just $80. There’s a lot of other things that you can purchase using the $50 in savings, but if you want it, you’re going to have to hurry. While there’s still some time before the bargain expires, it won’t be wise to wait until the last minute because stocks may get sold out before then. If you’re interested, you should proceed with the transaction right now.  Apple’s MagSafe wireless charging technology uses magnets to charge compatible devices, so you won’t have to fumble for cables each time. With the Apple MagSafe Duo Charger, the only cord that you need is the included USB-C to Lightning cable that connects it to the power outlet. Once it’s plugged in, you can simply place your iPhone, Apple Watch, or AirPods’ wireless charging case on the accessory to start charging them. Once you’re done using it, the Apple MagSafe Duo Charger folds away neatly, which makes it a nice travel companion. It’s highly recommended that you get your own Apple MagSafe Duo Charger now because it’s been discontinued by Apple with the introduction of the iPhone 15, which ditches Apple’s Lightning port in favor of USB-C. The accessory works with the iPhone 12 series, iPhone 13 series, iPhone 14 series, all Apple Watch models, and all AirPods that come with a wireless charging case. It will also work with non-MagSafe Qi-compatible devices, but with reduced power and slower charging times. For those who purchased compatible devices from iPhone deals, Apple Watch deals, and AirPods deals, the Apple MagSafe Duo Charger is one of the best investments that you can make when it comes to accessories. It’s available from Amazon’s Woot for a more affordable $80, following a $50 discount on its sticker price of $130. We’re not sure how long stocks will last though, as the product is already discontinued, so you shouldn’t be wasting any more time. Push forward with the transaction as soon as possible to secure your own Apple MagSafe Duo Charger at 38% off.  Black Friday deals are finally here, and it is time to kick the holiday shopping season off right. As we all know, the iPhone has a lot of great accessories, so any lover of the phone becomes pretty easy to shop for. Today, we're looking at the Apple Leather Wallet with MagSafe, a beautiful accessory that saves pocket space and frankly just looks beautiful on an iPhone. The wallet, which usually costs $59, is $14 off and now only costs $45. That's nearly 25% off in savings and a perfect price point for a casual gift to family, friends, or even yourself!

5 Reasons to Buy the iPhone 15 in 2024,2024-01-08T18:31:34+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/5-reasons-to-buy-an-iphone-15-today/,"Published on By We recently went into reasons to skip the iPhone 15 and today we’re switching gears and looking at reasons you might want to buy an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max. Apple’s iPhone 15 series represents the top-of-the-line. These are the company’s latest and greatest iPhones and those in the market for a new device should have them on a shopping list. Each model offers upgrades, but there are some key differences between the base models and the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The Pro and Pro Max models have better processors, cameras, and a new Action button on the side. We won’t detail every single feature here. Instead, our guide will focus on the practical reasons to upgrade from your current iPhone to one of the new models. Table of Contents We realize everyone’s wants and needs are a little bit different, but here are five very basic reasons you should consider buying an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max this year. If you want the latest and greatest software features, and the best software support moving forward, you’ll want to upgrade to an iPhone 15. In 2023, Apple ended full-blown iOS software support for the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus. These models are stuck on 16. Back in 2021, the company left the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE (2016), iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus on iOS 15. None of them moved to iOS 16. This time around, the iPhone XR, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max could be on the chopping block. We won’t know until Apple confirms iOS 18, but there’s a good chance these phones get left behind on iOS 17.  If you own a device that’s stuck on iOS 15, iOS 16, or an older version of iOS, it’s time to start thinking about an upgrade. These iPhones still get security patches, but they won’t get frequent bug fixes and they won’t get new features. The iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max run the best version of iOS 17 and they will get supported with new features, bug fixes, and security patches for five years, at least. If your current iPhone is starting to feel slow and sluggish after a recent software upgrade, or if gaming on your device is lacking, it might be time to upgrade. The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max come with Apple’s best chip, the A17. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus utilize an older chip, the A16 Bionic, but it’s better than whatever your current iPhone is using unless you own an iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max.  The iPhone 15’s processor and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) will ensure that your phone is fast, and games look and play great, for years to come. Remember, you can play games like Death Stranding, Resident Evil 4 Remake, and Assassin’s Creed Mirage on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. If your iPhone’s battery life is struggling and it can’t seem to hold a charge like it used to, you might want to upgrade to an iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro. Your iPhone’s battery will degrade over ti...",1

"Google’s Pixel Watch 2, our favorite Fitbit smartwatch, is cheaper than ever",2024-01-08T18:07:05+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24029920/google-pixel-watch-2-anker-622-magnetic-battery-maggo-tile-mate-philips-hue,"By  Sheena Vasani, a writer covering commerce, e-readers, and tech news. She previously wrote about everything from web development to AI at Inside. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Given how popular health-related New Year’s resolutions are, it makes sense to expect that a ton of good smartwatch deals will drop in January. This year is no exception, with retailers discounting everything from the Apple Watch Ultra 2 to more budget-friendly options like the Apple Watch SE and Fitbit Inspire 3. And now, a great Google Pixel Watch 2 deal has popped up that our Android readers will particularly appreciate. Right now, Google’s Pixel Watch 2 has returned to its all-time low price of $299.99 ($50 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.  Our favorite Fitbit smartwatch boasts even more Fitbit-powered health features and Google apps than its predecessor, including automatic workout tracking and access to Google Calendar and Gmail. What’s also great is that you don’t need to own a Google Pixel phone to get the most from the smartwatch, as is the case with Samsung’s watches. Most features are available to all users, which is why the Wear OS 4 wearable is also our top Android pick for non-Samsung users. It helps, too, that the Pixel Watch 2 lasts longer and can charge much faster than its predecessor, reaching 50 percent in about half an hour. The new Google Pixel Watch 2 now achieves a reliable 24 hours on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. It sports a new processor, multipath health sensor, Wear OS 4, and new safety features — all around a substantial update. Don’t worry, Apple aficionados, we’ve also got a good deal for you today. If you’re looking for a portable power bank to juice up your iPhone, right now the Anker 622 Magnetic Battery (MagGo) has returned to its best price of $39.99 ($30 off) at Amazon. It’s also available for the same price directly from Anker, though you’ll have to use the promo code WSPEU5CTPZ to buy it there. Like Apple’s now discontinued MagSafe Battery Pack, the power bank delivers 7.5 watts of power to your smartphone. However, the 5,000mAh battery pack boasts double the battery capacity of Apple’s accessory. It also comes with a sturdy built-in foldable kickstand that’s strong enough to prop up even Max-sized iPhones. Plus, unlike its predecessor, it now comes with a USB-C port that offers passthrough wireless charging, so you can prop up your phone and use it as a wireless charging pad. A portable power bank with magnetic wireless Qi charging, a convenient folding kickstand, and a USB-C port for wired charging. The original model has its USB-C port on the bottom, while a revised version has it on the side to allow passthrough wireless charging while the phone is propped up on the stand.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent t...",2
Apple Vision Pro Pre-Order Date & Time: What You Need to Know,2024-01-08T18:00:16+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/apple-vision-pro-pre-order-date-time/,"Published on By Apple’s new Apple Vision Pro spatial computer goes on sale soon. We’ve been getting questions about pre-orders and we’ll answer as many as we can in this guide.  The Apple Vision Pro finally has an official release date and it will land on shelves in early February in the United States. It should land in regions outside of the U.S. later this year. Those interested in buying the expensive device will be able to purchase it before the release date arrives. Apple will host a pre-order period ahead of the device’s official launch. Table of Contents With that in mind, here’s what you need to know about Apple Vision Pro pre-orders as we push toward the device’s highly anticipated release date. Apple Vision Pro pre-orders begin on Friday, January 19th. This is for the 256GB model which starts at a whopping $3,499 in the United States. We expect Apple to add additional storage options down the road as some Vision Pro developer kits reportedly utilized 1TB of storage.  The Apple Vision Pro pre-order period will stretch from the morning of January 19th to February 2nd. February 2nd is the day the device will arrive in physical retail locations. Apple will also start offering Apple Vision Pro demos in stores on the 2nd. There’s a very good chance we see shipping delays impact pre-orders. If you have your heart set on Apple’s new device, you may want to put in a pre-order ASAP. Ming-Chi Kuo, an analyst with solid supply chain sources, believes we’ll probably see a sell out thanks “to the demand from Apple’s core fans and heavy users. He believes we could see a sell out with lengthy shipping times emerging almost immediately. In recent years, Apple and its partners have opened up pre-orders for new devices at 5AM Pacific and that’s exactly what Apple’s confirmed for the Apple Vision Pro’s pre-order time. If you live on the west coast, and you want to buy an Apple Vision Pro the second pre-orders open up, you’ll need to wake up early. Of course, waking up early won’t guarantee you a delivery on February 2nd, but it gives you the best chance. Once Apple Vision Pro pre-orders start, you’ll be able to buy the device at the U.S. Apple Store online. It’s unclear if retailers like Amazon and Best Buy will make the device available on January 19th.  As we’ve noted many times in the past, the Apple Store app is often the quickest, and easiest, way to pre-order a new device from Apple. The app is free to download and it lets you buy the Apple Vision Pro the same way you would through Apple’s website. Your email address will not be published.

7 Reasons to Wait for the 2024 iPad Pro & 5 Reasons Not To,2024-01-08T17:34:19+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/5-reasons-to-wait-for-the-2024-ipad-pro-3-reasons-not-to/,"Published on By We didn’t see changes to the iPad lineup in 2023, but that won’t be the case in 2024. Apple’s working on a new iPad Pro and the device is rumored to have significant changes on board. If you’re in the market for a new tablet, you’ll want to take a long look at Apple’s iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini lines. These are all among the best tablets out on the market right now and they should be on your shopping list if you want to buy a new tablet. The iPad Pro line represents Apple’s high-end and it’s aimed at people who want a ton of horsepower for video editing, intense multitasking, and gaming. While many of you will be perfectly fine buying a new iPad right now, others may want to hang back and wait for the next version of the iPad Pro.  Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says there are multiple iPad Pros in development, codenamed J717, J718, J720 and J721 behind the scenes at Apple. There will be four new devices because we’ll see two different screen sizes as well as Wi-Fi only and cellular-enabled 2024 iPad Pro models. Apple is targeting a release in early 2024 which puts those of you in the hunt for a new tablet in a tough position. Upgrade right now or wait? Table of Contents While there are some great reasons to buy a new tablet right this second, there are also some great reasons to hang around and wait for the new iPad Pros. In this guide we’ll take you through the best reasons to consider waiting for the rumored 2024 iPad Pro and the best reasons to buy something else. 2024 iPad Pro rumors point to the arrival of OLED displays.  Display analyst Ross Young, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, South Korea’s ETNews and several other sources all maintain that OLED iPad Pros will debut in 2024. This lines up with rumors we heard back in 2022. Young says that while Apple plans to bring OLED to the MacBook Air line, Apple’s current focus is getting OLED displays ready for the iPad. Back in the summer of 2022, ETNews said the new OLED iPads will feature a lightweight design and “unrivaled image quality.” Apple’s current iPad lineup features backlit LCD displays. If the company does move to OLED, you can expect the 2024 iPad Pro’s display to offer better power consumption, higher contrast ratio, and improved color accuracy. The company has reportedly ordered OLED panels from LG Display and Samsung ahead of the 2024 iPad Pro launch. The Elec reports that Samsung will be the initial supplier of the 11-inch OLED screens while LG will produce displays for the 13-inch model. While the 2024 iPad Pro models will likely be the first models with OLED displays, Apple will reportedly bring the technology to the iPad Air and iPad mini. Research firm Omdia believes OLED will land on the iPad Air and iPad mini starting in 2026. ETNews says we’ll see an 8.7-inch iPad mini with OLED and a new 10.9-inch iPad Air with OLED in 2026. That’s a long way away so if you really want an OLED display on an iPad in the near future, you’ll have to buy a newer iPad Pro. We h...",2
Apple reportedly eyeing generative AI push and Siri overhaul for the iPhone,2024-01-08T17:24:50+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-reportedly-eyeing-generative-ai-push-and-siri-overhaul-for-the-iphone/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular Trying to play catch up in the race to integrate AI, Apple is planning some major generative AI features for its next version of iOS, according to noted tech reporter and Apple watcher Mark Gurman. In his latest Power On newsletter for Bloomberg, Gurman teased a number of initiatives that Apple reportedly will unveil at its 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference, which is expected to take place in June. Also: The best mobile accessories at CES 2024: Qi2 chargers, face-tracking phone stands, and more First, the company is looking to add such AI features as auto-summarizing and auto-complete to its core apps and productivity programs such as Pages and Keynote. Next, Apple is striving to integrate AI into services like Apple Music. In this instance, the company wants to use AI to automate the creation of playlists. And last, but certainly not least, Apple is planning a major overhaul for Siri, Gurman said. For developers, Apple is cooking up new versions of Xcode and other programming tools that will use generative AI to help its users complete code. And on the support front, the company is designing a new AI-powered system for AppleCare employees to better help customers troubleshoot technical problems, Gurman added. With major players such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google already capitalizing on generative AI, Apple seems to be lagging far behind. Though the company has been working on integrating AI into some of its products and services, so far it has nothing to show for it. As Gurman pointed out, that's a big risk for a tech firm that typically portrays itself as an innovator in consumer technology. Also: Apple Vision Pro in stores February 2, preorders start January 19 And now there are more competitors chomping at the AI bit. Due to be unveiled later this month, Samsung's new Galaxy S24 will reportedly pack in a bunch of AI features. Reports say the new phone will use built-in AI to generate images, compose emails and messages, translate text, and recognize voices. Mixed in with Apple's slow uptake of AI have been long-standing complaints about Siri. As an iPhone user, I've been frustrated with Siri's lack of reliability and lack of any real development. And it's not just me. Based on interviews with more than three dozen former Apple employees, a story published last April by The Information claimed that Siri has been widely derided by staff within the company for the tool's lack of functionality and improvements. Also: Phone makers are drooling over this 'multispectral camera' that captures colors better than your naked eye And even if Apple does outfit this year's iOS and iPhones with major new AI innovations and a better Siri, the company will likely take until 2025 to fully transform its generative AI vision into reality, according to Gurman. ""Starting with generative AI, Apple's tools — when they launch — will come nearly two years after ChatGPT began to take the world by storm, about a year after Amazon announced its revampe...",2
"Ready To Sell Some Organs? : The $3,500 Apple Vision Pro Headset Arrives February",2024-01-08T17:22:46+00:00,https://hiphopwired.com/1913148/apple-vision-pro-launch-details/," Trending Source: Apple / Vision Pro Apple is making headway in the video game, sneakingly dropping a video game console with its iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max phones. Now, the company that Jobs built is ready to jump into the VR world with its Apple Vision Pro headset this year.  Surprise, the Apple Vision Pro is dropping on February 2, which is much sooner than many people thought. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced on his X, formerly Twitter account, that the $3,500 headset is ready to launch.  Apple first revealed the headset during its Worldwide Developer Conference last June, and pre-orders for the ridiculously expensive device begin January 19 at 8 AM ET. Along with the release date, Apple also shared the price of the Zeiss prescription lenses users can get with them. Readers will start at $99, while prescription lenses cost $149. The base model, which will cost you an arm and leg, comes with 256GB of RAM and these other accessories: For $3,500, users will also get a 4K display for each eye, and a dedicated dial on the side of the headset will allow users to switch seamlessly from virtual to augmented reality. A dual-chip setup comprised of Apple’s in-house M2 chip and the new R1 chip will power the Vision Pro, and thanks to some impressive eye, head, and hand tracking capabilities, users don’t need to use the controller to navigate the interface. Apple is a bit late to the VR/AR game dominated by Meta, which is currently on its third headset, the Meta Quest 3, and it’s also a lot more affordable. With the Vision Pro, Apple is pushing it to be used with apps like FaceTime, Photos, and Movies while allowing users to watch spatial videos recorded on the iPhone 15. Apple also says users can access over 150 3D titles through the Apple TV app using the Vision Pro. This is all possible because Vision Pro runs visionOS, the company’s latest operating system. So watching shows like Monarch: Legacy of Monsters on the Vision Pro will be one epic experience. But is it worth $3,500? That’s the big question. We know fans of the Apple brand are not scared to swipe their cards for the latest tech from the company, and we are intrigued to see if that continues to be the case with Vision Pro.  — Photo: Apple / Vision Pro

The company revealed Monday that the headset will have 256 GB of storage, and prescription lens inserts for the device will be available starting at $149. Reading lens inserts start at $99. In a statement announcing the Vision Pro’s release date, CEO Tim Cook did not mince words: “Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created,” Cook said. “Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore.” The release of the Vision Pro marks Cook’s first new major hardware product launch at Apple in seven years, and only the third during his tenure as CEO.

The Vision Pro will have its own operating system, dubbed visionOS, as well as a novel three-dimensional user interface and input system that is controlled by a user’s eyes, hands and voice. The product is expected to face a number of challenges, as Apple is diving into an unproven market littered with other tech companies who have tried and largely failed to find mainstream traction for their augmented reality hardware devices.

 Jennifer Scott is the principal at Boynton. She says, “Ms. Stanfield is one of our most passionate teachers here at Boynton Elementary School. We just love her. She’s got a positive spirit, great energy every day. She loves her students. She’s got positive relationships with her students. She’s got great relationships with her parents and with the staff members, and she’s just top notch.” When asked to describe herself Ms. Stanfield says, “Well, I am a lot of things. I’m a mom. I have a two-year-old son. I’m a wife, I’m a teacher, I’m a friend, I’m a daughter, I’m a sister.” Students say, ” She is always helping us learn, and she keeps us from if we have a bad time to a good time. She’s always nice to us. She helps us when we’re having trouble reading something on AR when we’re having a bad day. She always helps us when we’re having a bad day and make it a good day for us. When we need help on our worksheets, she helps us so we can know what to do. She helps us when we’re distressed, when we go outside and when we fall, she helps us. She’s the best teacher I could probably have.” Ms. Stanfield remembers, “I was homeschooled, and I had a great example of a teacher in my mom. And then we took some classes at other places, and I had some great examples there as well. So, all of those things motivated me through my experience to want to go on and do that with other kids.” She continues, “I love the kids. You don’t do it for the early mornings or the long nights. You don’t do it for all the paperwork and the testing. You really do it for the kids. They are my absolute joy every single day. The legacy I would like to leave behind with my students is mutual respect. And at the end of the day, for me, every relationship I build with parents or students or coworkers falls back on mutual respect. Just a genuine knowledge that I truly care about them and want the best for them and want them to succeed.”

Yet another serious competitor to the Vision Pro takes shape,2024-01-16T23:14:34+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/lg-xr-headset-meta-quest-pro-2-answer-to-the-apple-vision-pro/,"Following rumors of a new extended reality (XR) headset, LG CEO Cho Joo-wan made the news official, confirming it could arrive as early as 2025. It wasn’t clear if this would be an LG branded product or if the headset is made in partnership with another company, such as Meta, but the timing is right to launch an Apple Vision Pro competitor. LG isn’t new to XR, but its last VR headset was released seven years ago. This makes it seem unlikely that the company known for TVs and supplying advanced display technology to Apple and other manufacturers would suddenly return to this abandoned product category. LG is a leader in screen technology that has made super-bright TVs and transparent displays possible. These recent advancements, shown at CES 2024, make it clear LG is still pushing the limits of what’s possible. An LG breakthrough in XR displays could give competitors a way to challenge Apple’s Vision Pro, which features remarkably crisp 4K-per-eye screen resolution. To add weight to the possibility of a second-generation Meta Quest Pro headset, rumors and leaks have suggested a partnership between LG and Meta as far back as 2022. While Meta’s 2022 Quest Pro didn’t sell well, it was the first attempt at a work-centric VR headset with mixed reality capabilities, aka XR. In 2024, the interest in XR has skyrocketed. Even smart glasses manufacturers like Xreal and RayNeo are launching more affordable solutions amid Apple’s entry into the market. The Mac computer manufacturer rebranded its XR headset as a spatial computer, changing expectations for the Vision Pro. It seems likely that Meta will want to join in with a direct competitor rather than expect its $500 Quest 3 mixed reality headset to stand up to the superior displays and performance of the $3,500 Vision Pro. If Meta does launch a new high-end headset, naming it the Quest Pro 2 would be most logical, but riding the wave of love for the Quest 3 could lead to branding it as a Quest 3 Pro. To be clear, LG made no reference to Meta in The Guru, a Korean-language news source that reported the news. Meta hasn’t shared its plans for the future beyond the metaverse company’s ongoing commitment and funding to make AR and VR the technology of the future. You don't normally see tech titans like Nvidia and Apple pair up, but the two companies announced at this week's Nvidia GTC 2024 that they are coming together around the Vision Pro. Nvidia is bringing its Omniverse Cloud platform to Apple's headset, allowing users to interact with objects and design directly through the Vision Pro. The basis of support is a set of Omniverse Cloud APIs that can stream Omniverse assets to Apple's headset. Omniverse isn't running on the Vision Pro itself. Instead, designers can stream scenes made with the Universal Scene Description (OpenUSD) in Omniverse to the Vision Pro, and interact with the 3D objects natively. Code found within visionOS appears to reveal the countries in which Apple’s Vision Pro headset will launch n...",2
Apple may have just lost big at the Supreme Court,2024-01-16T22:56:21+00:00,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-01-16/supreme-court-rebuffs-apples-appeal-on-app-payments-threatening-billions-in-revenue,,No rating found
2 Reasons to Pre-Order the Apple Vision Pro & 3 Reasons to Wait,2024-01-16T22:39:49+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/apple-vision-pro-pre-order-or-wait/,"Published on By There are some great reasons to pre-order the new Apple Vision Pro, but some shoppers might want to put the credit card away and wait. Apple’s finally confirmed the key dates for the Apple Vision Pro launch and the company’s new spatial computer is set to go on sale for the first time later this week.  The long-awaited device will officially go up for pre-order at Apple on Friday, January 19th. Pre-orders start at 5AM Pacific which means you might need to wake up early to get an order in. This is only for the United States. The device doesn’t have a release date in other regions though analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes it will launch internationally before WWDC 2024 in June. Kuo says Apple is starting in the United States for three reasons: the limited initial supply of Vision Pro, it wants to ensure the sales process in the U.S. market goes smoothly and it needs time “to modify the algorithms to comply with regulations in other countries.” The Apple Vision Pro is a brand new product which means there’s a ton of excitement around its arrival. The excitement, and potential shipping delays, are among the reasons why you might want to pre-order the device as soon as it goes on sale. If you can’t or simply don’t want to pre-order, the Apple Vision Pro will land in physical Apple Store locations in early February. The device’s release date is set for February 2nd. Table of Contents Buying the Apple Vision Pro right away might be tempting, but spending $3,499 (or more if Apple confirms additional storage options) on a first-generation device and a product you haven’t had a chance to try in person makes it a pretty tough decision. In this guide, we’ll help you decide if you should pre-order the Apple Vision Pro or wait until the dust settles. Simply put, if you want the Apple Vision Pro as soon as possible, you’ll want to put in a pre-order when they open up on the 19th.  We could see supply constraints impact Apple’s new device in the early going. Don’t be surprised if the shipping date gets pushed back relatively quickly after pre-orders open up. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has solid supply chain sources, believes this will indeed be the case. Kuo says thanks “to the demand from Apple’s core fans and heavy users, the Vision Pro should sell out soon after it is available for pre-order or sale, resulting in a longer shipping time.” In a follow-up, Kuo says he thinks “Apple will produce 60,000 to 80,000 units of Vision Pro for the February 2 release” and that it will “will sell out soon after the release.” If you want a guaranteed delivery on or around February 2nd, you’ll want to put in a pre-order through Apple shortly after pre-orders open up. If you don’t, and shipping times start to slip (or vanish completely), you’ll have to go into a store or wait. If you pass on a pre-order, but still want the Apple Vision Pro in your hands on or around February 2nd, you’ll need to head into a physical Apple Store location. We don’t expect lines wrap ar...",2

			Trending:		 The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed a court order to take effect that could loosen Apple’s grip on its lucrative iPhone app store, potentially siphoning billions of dollars away from one of the world’s most profitable companies. The justices rejected Apple’s appeal of lower-court rulings that found some of Apple’s app store rules for apps purchased on more than 1 billion iPhones constitute unfair competition under California law. The appeal stemmed from an antitrust lawsuit filed in 2020 by Epic Games, maker of the popular Fortnite video game. Epic lost its broader claim that Cupertino, California-based Apple was violating federal antitrust law, and the justices also rejected Epic’s appeal Tuesday. But in turning away Apple’s effort to maintain exclusive control over in-app payments, the court lifted a hold on an order to allow app developers throughout the U.S. to insert links to other payment options besides its own within iPhone apps. That change would make it easier for developers to avoid paying Apple’s commissions ranging from 15% to 30%. Rapper and entrepreneur Sean “Diddy” Combs has withdrawn his lawsuit against Diageo as part of a settlement with the London-based spirits giant. Combs and Diageo “have now agreed to resolve all disputes between them,” the two parties said in a statement released Tuesday. Diageo is now the sole owner of Ciroc vodka and DeLeon tequila, two brands Combs had promoted in the past, and has no business relationship with Combs going forward. No further details of the settlement were released. Combs sued Diageo last May, saying the company didn’t make promised investments in Ciroc and DeLeon and treated them as inferior “urban” products.

"iOS 17.3, iOS 17.4 & iOS 17.5: What’s Coming Next for iPhone",2024-01-16T22:04:08+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/ios-17-ios-18-iphone/,"Published on By With lots of new software on the way, we felt it would be prudent to put together an iOS release timeline for iPhone users. Apple’s been busy in the months since iOS 17’s initial release back in September. The company’s released several prominent updates including iOS 17.4 which dropped in early March. More recently, Apple released an iOS 17.4.1 update to fix bugs discovered within the operating system. The company won’t stop there. You can expect a steady stream of point updates (iOS 17 x.x.x) and milestone upgrades (iOS 17 x.x) to roll out over the next six months.  Thanks to leaks, Apple’s beta program, and many years of experience covering software, we have a pretty good read on what you can expect on the iOS 17 front. We’ve also heard a lot about iOS 17’s successor, presumably called iOS 18. So, if you’ve been curious about what’s in Apple’s pipeline, here’s a quick look at what’s coming next for iPhone users in terms of software updates. Table of Contents This guide will take you through known features, release dates, and betas. It will also lead you through the unknown so you can set proper expectations. Apple finally put a new iOS 17.5 update into beta testing. The software should arrive in May after a stint in beta. iOS 16.5 and iOS 15.5 both arrived in mid-May so Apple might use a similar window for iOS 17.5. If Apple sticks to its usual protocol, iOS 17.6 will arrive in July. iOS 17 development will start to slow down and the next milestone version of iOS 17, iOS 17.7, will probably roll out alongside iOS 18 in September. Of course, we’ll see point upgrades arrive in between all of these milestone upgrades and we may see some Rapid Security Response updates as well. Rapid Security Response updates are much smaller than typical iOS software releases and, according to Apple, they “deliver important security improvements between software updates—for example, improvements to the Safari web browser, the WebKit framework stack, or other critical system libraries.” We’ve only seen the company push a few of these upgrades to iPhone users, but we may see iOS 17 get a few before iOS 18 arrives. Apple’s working on the next version of iOS, dubbed iOS 18.  We’ve put together a larger guide that covers iOS 18, but here are a few items of note: We’ll see rumors outline iOS 17’s successor in great detail in the months ahead. So, in addition to tracking new versions of iOS 17, you’ll also want to keep an eye on the iPhone’s next operating system. If security is important to you, think about installing Apple's iOS 17.4.1 update right away. The iOS 17.4.1 update includes two security patches. These patches will help keep your device and its data protected from harm. And that makes iOS 17.4.1 an important upgrade. If you missed iOS 17.4 and older software, you'll get the security patches from updates you missed when you upgrade to iOS 17.4.1. iOS 17.4 had four security patches on board.  The update also delivered quantum security protectio...",2

Microsoft CEO Says AI Can Replace the Entire App Store and Google Search,2024-01-16T21:40:57+00:00,https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2024/01/microsoft-ceo-says-ai-can-replace-the-entire-app-store-and-google-search.html,"Home » Artificial intelligence » Microsoft CEO Says AI Can Replace the Entire App Store and Google Search Satya Nadella, Chairman & CEO, Microsoft joins Bloomberg’s Brad Stone for a conversation at Bloomberg House at Davos. Nadella talked about using AI to break the Google Search Monopoly and replace Apple iPhone and the entire app store. AI can be the Universal App. Currently, individual use dozens or even over a hundred apps. IF AI is mainly delivered via Enterprises then Microsoft would have the advantage in an Enterprise dominant AI world.

Except that they will seem eager to do whatever you want done and will be instantly available 24/7. It’s a prospect very few of us will be able to resist, regardless of how much we may decry it now.  An app that waters your plants, pays your bills, does your taxes, and whatever else, become old news when you can just tell your personal assistant, in English (or even Swahili), what you want, and they deliver, even asking for clarifications where needed (but not so often as you might think because they already know you better than you know yourself).  It will not be like having Wodehouse’s Jeeves, the valet’s valet, at your service; it will be like having a super-speed, multithreaded Jeeves with almost instant access to all the information and knowledge on the worldwide web. A Jeeves that cannot (perish the thought, even) ever be overworked — and far too many of us will happily become Bertie Wooster, and this won’t matter because so very many people would be better off that way, indeed society itself would be better off for it.

Samsung phones are just overpriced for what they are: android phones that don’t do anything significantly better than their significantly cheaper Chinese counterparts. It’s debatable if iPhones are overpriced but imo they’re more secure and a better deal for your hard earned money. They are both overpriced - no debate necessary - and everything else was just misinformation. Apple is good bang for your money since the resell value is still high. This is because of market demand. When this is getting less pricess will drop.  Another point is the repair, which apple is making it more and more difficult. So once something needs to be repaired than A you need to pay a lot or B you have apple care and you pay still a lot but less than without.  Just a note but all phones for 1000 USD or more are overpriced. Most people say look how beautiful the pictures are. Sorry but phone camera are just marketing and processed images. This counts for apple as well as Android. This is just a marketing, different countries have different data. This is a travesty.  Samsung is superior, and they don't use dodgy child and slave labor.  Why anyone uses Apple remains a mystery, and it is disappointing to read that they are outselling Samsung.  Apple also has the tendency to force unnecessary updates upon users and overcharge for repairing their defective products, something Korean companies never do. I have an i-phone. Big mistake.

Apple is now marketing Vision Pro as the 'ultimate entertainment device',2024-01-16T20:10:15+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-is-now-marketing-vision-pro-as-the-ultimate-entertainment-device/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular Since its initial launch, Apple has remained generally quiet about what the Vision Pro will offer, with the primary selling point being experiencing spatial video. Now, Apple is unveiling new entertainment experiences and marketing the headset as a premiere entertainment device.  ""Apple Vision Pro is the ultimate entertainment device,"" said Greg Joswiak, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing. Also: Apple Vision Pro in stores February 2, pre-orders start January 19 At launch, users will be able to access more than 150 3D movies, Apple Immersive Video, popular streaming services through visionOS, and more.  VisionOS works dynamically with your physical space to showcase apps, games, and other experiences in different Environments --  dynamic views with soundscapes that evolve based on the time of day.  Using visionOS, users will be able to access a variety of entertainment services and platforms including Apple Music, Apple TV, and streaming services such as Disney+, ESPN, MLB, PGA Tour, Max, Discovery+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, Peacock, Pluto TV, Tubi, Fubo, Crunchyroll, Red Bull TV, IMAX, TikTok, and MUBI.  Also: Preordering the Apple Vision Pro? You'll have these hoops to jump through VisionOS also features a Travel Mode, which allows airline passengers to stabilize visuals for an ideal in-flight viewing experience, and a Guest User feature, which allows you to share specific apps and experiences with family and friends, according to Apple.  In addition to the standard Vision Pro watching experience, which is already impressive with a screen that feels 100 feet wide, and a cinematic experience in Environments, Apple revealed Apple Immersive Video.  Immersive Video  features 180-degree 3D 8K recordings captured with Spatial Audio and designed to immerse viewers in the story. At launch, users can experience a curated selection of immersive films and series on the Apple TV at no additional cost, including Alicia Keys: Rehearsal Room, Adventure, Prehistoric Planet Immersive, and Wild Life.  Also: You can get an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, and a Mac for the price of one Vision Pro Finally, at launch users can watch more than 150 3D movies, including titles such as Avatar: The Way of Water and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Users can purchase or rent a 3D version of their favorite movies, and users who own movies with a 3D edition can access that version at no additional cost.  According to Apple, streaming apps such as Disney+ will also offer 3D versions of their latest movies at launch, and 3D editions will debut alongside or shortly after 2D releases.  These advanced viewing experiences are made possible by the Vision Pro's impressive tech, including its pair of ultra-high-resolution micro-OLED displays with Dolby Vision.

Apple removes blood oxygen sensor from new watches. What does this mean for current users?,2024-01-16T19:28:59+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-removes-blood-oxygen-sensor-from-new-watches-what-does-this-mean-for-current-users/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular In the latest step in a legal battle over a blood oxygen sensor, a federal judge has ruled that Apple cannot sell its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches if they have the feature in question. Just a month ago, Apple halted US sales of its new Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models over a patent dispute regarding the watch's blood oxygen sensor. A federal court is currently reviewing the case and attempting to determine if Apple violated patents of Masimo, a health monitoring technology company. While the case is under review, a ban was placed on the import of all Apple watches with the sensor in question.  Also: The best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more compared Apple has filed an appeal and asked for a temporary pause on the ban, but that request has been denied. As a result, watches with the sensor cannot be imported into the United States while the case plays out -- an unprecedented situation for Apple. So what does this mean for the future of the Apple Watch? What about current users? According to a report from Bloomberg, prior to the ban, Apple had started shipping watches without the functionality in question just in case the ban happened. This was a software change instead of a hardware one, meaning the sensor was still present -- it just wasn't active. US Customs and Border Protection decided the new watch fell ""outside the scope"" of the import ban, meaning they were ready to hit the market.  These new watches have been sent to Apple stores, but the stores have been instructed not to open or sell them until receiving further word.  Apple is reportedly working on a software change that updates the sensor's algorithm enough to avoid the ban but still keep its functionality; however, disabling the feature outright was probably the easiest and fastest answer for now. One of the biggest questions though is what this means for current users of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Series 9, for whom the feature is working. Apple hasn't said anything to this point, but since the company was attempting a workaround of sorts, it seems like the goal is to keep the feature around long-term.  Also: The best fitness rings to kickstart your 2024 wellness goals Because the ban only applied to import of the watches, it's possible that current watches are just fine and will never be affected. But, it's also possible that Apple could decide to remove the feature from all watches to avoid legal complications -- so it's worth checking the notes on any upcoming Apple update if you utilize this feature. The legal battle over the sensor could take up to a year to complete.",-2
Supreme Court declines appeals from Apple and Epic Games in App Store case,2024-01-16T19:27:55+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/supreme-court-declines-appeals-from-apple-and-epic-games-in-app-store-case-192755323.html?src=rss,"The US Supreme Court has declined to hear the appeals filed by both Apple and Epic Games following a judge’s ruling that Apple must allow developers to offer alternative methods to pay for apps and services other than through the App Store. It did not provide an explanation as to why it refused to review either appeal, but it means the permanent injunction giving developers a way to avoid the 30 percent cut Apple takes will remain in place. Apple made the appeal to the high court back in September of last year, requesting it review the circuit court’s decision it deemed “unconstitutional.” The case brought forward by Epic Games is the first to challenge the business model of the App store, which helps Apple rake in billions. In May 2023, Apple said that developers generated about $1 trillion in total billings through the App Store in 2022. Gaming apps sold on the App Store generate an estimated $100 billion in revenue each year. The Supreme Court denied both sides’ appeals of the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. The court battle to open iOS to competing stores and payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all developers. — Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) January 16, 2024 While the Ninth Circuit ruled in favor of Epic’s appeal that Apple has indeed broken California's Unfair Competition law, it rejected Epic’s claim that the App store is a monopoly. In addition to declining to hear Apple’s appeal, SCOTUS also will not review Epic’s appeal that the district court had made “legal errors.” Epic claimed that Apple violates federal antitrust laws through its business model, however, this is not an issue the high court will consider. The CEO of Epic Games, Tim Sweeney, called the appeal denial “a sad outcome” on X. Epic Games has been front and center in the fight against Apple’s developer transaction fee policy since 2020. Other companies, including Spotify and the New York Times, are also trying to challenge app store policies on Apple and Google platforms. The Coalition for App Fairness, which consists of more than 60 companies now, believes no developers should be required to use the app store exclusively. The Epic lawsuit was just the start — problems have been piling up for Apple. Even the Department of Justice (DOJ) is reportedly considering filing an antitrust case against it. The DOJ has been conducting an investigation into whether Apple’s App Store practices have killed competition in the space.

Here’s what you need to know about preordering the Apple Vision Pro,2024-01-16T19:21:06+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/24030316/apple-vision-pro-headset-preorder-how-to-buy-price-availability-release-date-demo,"By  Sheena Vasani, a writer covering commerce, e-readers, and tech news. She previously wrote about everything from web development to AI at Inside. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. After first introducing the Vision Pro during last year’s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple recently revealed that the forthcoming headset will be available starting February 2nd. If you can’t wait to get your hands on it, however, you can preorder it in the US from Apple Store locations and online for $3,499 starting today, January 19th, at 8AM ET.  According to Bloomberg, Apple is also considering the UK, Canada, and China as some of the first international markets to offer the headset following its US launch. If you plan on placing your order today, it’s a good idea to read up on everything you need to know ahead of time. To make doing so a little easier, we’ve rounded up all the info you’ll need to place a preorder below, including a few details regarding the headset, the various accessories it comes packaged with, and more. We’ll also be updating this post if we learn more details — so be sure to bookmark this page. In a nutshell, the Apple Vision Pro is a mixed-reality headset, one that features a 4K display for each eye and lets users switch between virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) with a Digital Crown-style dial. Along with Apple’s last-gen M2 chip, the headset is powered by the new R1 processor and runs visionOS, a new operating system that allows users to navigate using their eyes, hands, or voice.  Apple has described the headset as a productivity tool and entertainment device, but in truth, we’re not sure exactly sure what the standout feature is yet. We do have an idea of what it’s capable of, though. Apple says the headset can mirror the screen on your Mac, essentially acting as a portable monitor for multitasking. At the same time, you can also use the headset to run iPhone and iPad apps like FaceTime, Photos, and Movies, and even view spatial videos recorded with the iPhone 15 Pro. The headset will also supposedly provide an immersive streaming and gaming experience, offering users access to services like Disney Plus and the Apple TV app, along with games like Sonic Dream Team and Super Fruit Ninja. We haven’t reviewed the new headset yet, but in our short time demoing it, we were impressed. While Apple calls the headset an augmented reality device, we found it was more like a fantastic VR headset (even if Apple would prefer that we call it a spatial computer). It also offered the highest resolution VR display we’d ever seen, with zero lag and impressive video passthrough that’s crisp and clear. Speaking of Apple Vision Pro demos, you can also try out the headset for yourself if you’re on the fence about buying it, provided you live in the US. You can sign up to demo the Apple Vision Pro at your local Apple Store starting at 8AM on February 2nd on a first-come, first-...",2

The mobile regulatory landscape is changing at an inconvenient time for Apple,2024-01-16T18:48:48+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/16/apple-app-store-revenue/,"TechCrunch primarily covers the startup world, but we keep at least one eye on Big Tech at all times. And there’s perhaps no story more interesting in the world of technology giants than a changing of the guard: Microsoft has stolen the “most valuable” crown from Apple and things are getting interesting. The changeover is not an idle one. Microsoft’s tie-up with OpenAI and its rapid deployment of AI tools into its various software products has earned it favor with investors, who anticipate that it’s going to manage to extract revenue, growth, and profits from all the AI-related work. The release of Copilot Pro is a good example of what Redmond is up to. The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.  Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday. At the same time, Apple is seeing its most critical market, smartphones, shrink as it runs into legal challenges around the world. The smartphone market shrank 3.2% last year after declining by a massive 11.3% in 2022, according to International Data Corporation (IDC). The good news for Apple, however, is that the iPhone once again became the top-selling smartphone last year. Still, you can’t build toward long-term growth by leading a shrinking market. In contrast, Microsoft recently helped resolve a governance and leadership explosion at OpenAI, allowing Redmond to retain near-majority ownership of the for-profit arm of the AI company. That means Microsoft is intent on bringing more AI goodies to its users. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear Apple’s appeal of the antitrust case brought by Epic Games, and in the EU, the company is reportedly preparing an App Store to suit local regulations. Both of these developments could affect the company’s ability to generate revenue from mobile commerce and its hardware and software. First, a little context. In its fourth quarter ending September 2023, Apple’s revenue fell 1% to $89.50 billion from a year earlier, and the company’s revenue also shrank in the first nine months of 2023 compared to 2022. But all the same, Apple’s net income in its Q4 2023 alone amounted to a whopping $23 billion. That’s a simply bonkers amount of money. Nothing that we are discussing today risks the company’s scale or ability to make lots of money. But small cuts can add up. Apple’s shares are down more than 1% today; they’ve fallen 6% in the past month, and over the past 12 months, they have climbed 35%. Apple’s appeal of the ruling in the Epic case wasn’t only a question of principle; there are billions at stake here. The crux of the issue is its App Store, and whether Apple device owners can bypass it. Or: Whether app developers can tell redirect users to complete their payments outside the App Store, thus avoiding Apple’s cut, which can be as high as 30%. Seeing its appeal dismissed means that Apple will have to live with the previous judge’s decision: That while Apple had not engaged in anticompetitive practices, it will...",-2

Woman takes pet pig into Brazil Apple Store and lets it defecate all over the floor without offering to help clean it up,2024-01-16T18:06:07+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12969395/Apple-store-pig-poo.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By Adry Torres For Dailymail.com   Published:  16:08, 16 January 2024   |  Updated:  18:06, 16 January 2024      70 View  comments  This little piggy defecated at an Apple Store in Brazil and her owner did not show a care for picking it up. The bizarre incident took place at the tech giant's shop at a mall in Rio de Janeiro on Monday. Footage showed the woman walking out of the store with the pig strapped to a leash and at least seven chunks of feces lying on the floor next to a display table. Customers could be seen keeping their distance and staring at the woman in shock as she stood near the entrance without showing an intent to remove her four-legged pet's droppings. A woman holds on to her pet pig after leaving an Apple Store in Rio de Janeiro without removing its feces from the floor A woman in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has come under a wave of criticism for abandoning an Apple Store and not picking up feces after her pet pic defecated near a display table A pet pig was spotted at an Apple Store after it left behind a trail of poop and its owner walked out without picking it up 'Man, people have lost their sense, poo in the middle of the store,' a male shopper said while recording. The video went viral after Brazilian political consultant Rodrigo Bethlem shared it on his Instagram account. It's unclear exactly when the incident happened.  'A person brings a pig for a walk in the Apple store, and still doesn't (pick up) the poop made by the animal,' he wrote. 'Humanity sick.' The political analyst's followers shamed the woman for failing to clean up after her pet. 'Really, of you decide to take your pet, you are assuming that you will also be responsible for the cleaning of any (mess) that it makes and also any attack that the animal can make on someone,' Solange Texeira commented. Social media users have slammed a woman for failing to remove feces from the floor at an Apple Store in Rio de Janeiro after her pet pig defecated Another follower opined the woman should have been aware of the possibility of her pet defecating in public. 'The least a polite and conscious pet owner should do when taking their pet anywhere is to assume the risk of feces and urine from your pet,' Kelly Costa wrote. 'Immediately after what happened, if it actually happens, collect, out of conscience and education. … If she didn't clean it up I'm sorry but that was extremely poor in taste and lack of education.' Lu Tulio slammed the pet owner over her carelessness. 'The problem isn't with the animal, it's with the owner who is totally clueless,' she wrote. 'Want to take the piggy for a walk, OK, that's not wrong, wrong is for her not to clean up the mess the pet makes.'

"Apple Vision Pro hands-on, again, for the first time",2024-01-16T18:00:00+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/24040075/apple-vision-pro-hands-on-virtual-reality,"By  Victoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 11 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. It’s a slushy, snowy day in New York City — the kind where I’d normally look out the window and declare a work-from-home day. But today, I hauled myself out into the wet cold because Apple had offered Nilay Patel and me demo time with the Apple Vision Pro. Nilay and a few others have already spent time with the Vision Pro, but for everyone else, the $3,499 Vision Pro has been shrouded in mystery. But my half-hour with it revealed that Apple’s headset felt more familiar than I thought it would. The iPhone face scan to select the correct light seal is very similar to setting up Face ID. Slipping it onto your head isn’t that different from any number of other VR headsets, like the Meta Quest line — the design and fabric headband are just more Apple-y. And like any other VR headset, you feel it sitting on your head and wrecking your hairdo once you slip it on. (If you’ve got long hair like me, you’ll feel it bunch up in the back, too.) After the headset is situated, there’s a brief setup for eye tracking — look at various dots and tap your fingers together — and then visionOS drops you into the app launcher, which looks a lot like Launchpad on a Mac. The only difference is you can still see the room around you, if you so choose. On the upper right-hand side, there’s a digital crown — something I’m well acquainted with as an Apple Watch user. You use it to recenter your homescreen or immerse yourself in a virtual environment. The opposite side has a button for taking spatial photos and video. This, too, looks like the side button on an Apple Watch. As in previous demos, vision tracking was fast and accurate. Looking at a menu item or button immediately highlighted it. Movie titles highlighted in the Apple TV app as my eyes roved over them. Apple had us open the virtual keyboard in Safari to browse to a website, and it worked, albeit clunkily: you look at a letter and pinch your fingers to select it. You can type as fast as your eyes can move and fingers can pinch, which means it’s much easier to dictate to Siri. I had a little trouble with the pinch and double-pinch gestures at first because I was apparently holding the pinches too long when trying to select. It wasn’t until I was told to lightly tap and let go — the same action as double tap on the Apple Watch — that it all started to click. The demo we received was similar to what Nilay got to experience at WWDC, with a few additions here and there. Even so, reading about Nilay’s experience a few months ago and then actually getting to see it myself were two very different things. I’ve read how bonkers the screen is. But even knowing that, my eyes weren’t really prepared for two 4K screens blasting 23-micron pixels into each eyeball. I had to remind myself to blink lest my eyes dry out. The virtual world inside the Vision P...",2
What to watch on Apple TV Plus: 30 best shows streaming right now,2024-01-16T17:51:00+00:00,https://www.avclub.com/what-to-watch-on-apple-tv-best-shows-streaming-now-1849185167,"Apple TV+ quickly emerged as one of the most popular and reliable streamers with the breakout Emmy-winning hit Ted Lasso. But the platform offers so much more, including comedies like Shrinking and powerhouse dramas such as Silo and Pachinko. Unsure about what to watch? The A.V.

The show follows Máximo Gallardo, who gets his dream job as the cabana boy at the hottest resort in Acapulco, Mexico. But he soon realizes the job is far more demanding than he anticipated. A demanding clientele tends to do that. As mentioned in The A.V. Club’s review: “This winsome comedy is more concerned with the mostly Mexican employees of the fictional Las Colinas resort, many of whom grew up near it and have been irresistibly drawn to it since childhood.” Season three arrives in May.  3 / 34 Stars: Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, Zoë Chao, John Cho, Ben Schwartz, Jamie Demetriou, Ilana Glazer, Ken Jeong, Paul Walter Hauser, Anna Konkle Number of seasons: 2 Stream it now: Apple TV+ Who doesn’t love an enticing, funny murder mystery?

The Irish murder mystery follows four Garvey sisters as they get tangled up in an insurance investigation after the death of their brother-in-law, whom they may or may not have killed.  5 / 34 Stars: Taron Egerton, Paul Walter Hauser, Ray Liotta, Sepideh Moafi, Greg Kinnear, Jake McLaughlin,  Joe Williamson, Robert Diago DoQui, Trazi Lashawn,  Robyn Malcolm, Laney Stiebing Number of seasons on Apple TV+: 1 Stream it now: Apple TV+ Jonesing for a tightly-paced, six-episode thriller?

When Will Apple Release the 2024 iPad Pro?,2024-01-16T17:26:59+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/when-will-apple-release-the-2024-ipad-pro/,"Published on By Apple didn’t announce new iPad models in 2023 which puts a huge spotlight on 2024. The company is reportedly planning to launch all-new iPad Pro models and we want to help prospective buyers set appropriate expectations about the release date. If you’re in the hunt for a new tablet, especially a powerful one, the OLED iPad Pro should definitely be on your radar. But how long will you have to wait to buy one of these new iPad Pro models from Apple? We’ve heard quite a bit about the 2024 iPad Pro launch and we finally have some clarity when it comes to the launch window. In an effort to help you properly budget your time and money, we want to take a closer look at the 2024 iPad Pro release. You’ll want to keep this in mind as you search for your next tablet. Let’s start with the rumors.  Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who is typically very accurate, says the new iPad Pro’s are currently scheduled to arrive in March or April. Korean publication The Elec says display production is underway and Apple’s fully-assembled iPads will be shipped to Apple in April. Another report, from hit-or-miss publication Digitimes, suggests the 2024 iPad Pro release will come sometime in mid-to-late 2024. In other words, in the summer or fall. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says mass production has been delayed to late 1Q24–2Q24 “due to production issues with OLED panel modules.” The second quarter runs from April to June. So, as of right now, we’re looking at three potential windows for the 2024 iPad Pro: spring, summer, or fall. So what does this mean exactly? Let’s take a look.  If you’ve followed Apple launches for awhile, you know the company typically sticks to certain patterns. And that means we can confidently provide you with potential release months for the 2024 iPad Pros: Again, just about everything we’ve seen and heard points to a release in March or April. Gurman believes Apple will skip a media event and announce the devices on its website. The announcements will then be followed by online videos and a marketing campaign. Sources believe the new iPad Pro’s will start shipping to customers in April. 2024 iPad Pro rumors point to the arrival of OLED displays. Display analyst Ross Young, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, South Korea's ETNews and several other sources all maintain that OLED iPad Pros will debut in 2024. This lines up with rumors we heard back in 2022.  Young says that while Apple plans to bring OLED to the MacBook Air line, Apple's current focus is getting OLED displays ready for the iPad. Back in the summer of 2022, ETNews said the new OLED iPads will feature a lightweight design and ""unrivaled image quality.""  Apple's current iPad lineup features backlit LCD displays. If the company does move to OLED, you can expect the 2024 iPad Pro's display to offer better power consumption, higher contrast ratio, and improved color accuracy.  The company has reportedly ordered OLED panels from LG Display and Samsung ahead of the 2024 iPad Pro launch.  The Elec r...",2

Apple’s working on a new iPad Pro and the device is rumored to have significant changes on board. If you’re in the market for a new tablet, you’ll want to take a long look at Apple’s iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini lines. These are all among the best tablets out on the market right now and they should be on your shopping list if you want to buy a new tablet. The iPad Pro line represents Apple’s high-end and it’s aimed at people who want a ton of horsepower for video editing, intense multitasking, and gaming. While many of you will be perfectly fine buying a new iPad right now, others may want to hang back and wait for the next version of the iPad Pro.  Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says there are multiple iPad Pros in development, codenamed J717, J718, J720 and J721 behind the scenes at Apple. There will be four new devices because we’ll see two different screen sizes as well as Wi-Fi only and cellular-enabled 2024 iPad Pro models. Apple is targeting a release in early 2024 which puts those of you in the hunt for a new tablet in a tough position. Upgrade right now or wait? Table of Contents While there are some great reasons to buy a new tablet right this second, there are also some great reasons to hang around and wait for the new iPad Pros. In this guide we’ll take you through the best reasons to consider waiting for the rumored 2024 iPad Pro and the best reasons to buy something else. 2024 iPad Pro rumors point to the arrival of OLED displays.  Display analyst Ross Young, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, South Korea’s ETNews and several other sources all maintain that OLED iPad Pros will debut in 2024. This lines up with rumors we heard back in 2022. Young says that while Apple plans to bring OLED to the MacBook Air line, Apple’s current focus is getting OLED displays ready for the iPad. Back in the summer of 2022, ETNews said the new OLED iPads will feature a lightweight design and “unrivaled image quality.” Apple’s current iPad lineup features backlit LCD displays. If the company does move to OLED, you can expect the 2024 iPad Pro’s display to offer better power consumption, higher contrast ratio, and improved color accuracy. The company has reportedly ordered OLED panels from LG Display and Samsung ahead of the 2024 iPad Pro launch. The Elec reports that Samsung will be the initial supplier of the 11-inch OLED screens while LG will produce displays for the 13-inch model. While the 2024 iPad Pro models will likely be the first models with OLED displays, Apple will reportedly bring the technology to the iPad Air and iPad mini. Research firm Omdia believes OLED will land on the iPad Air and iPad mini starting in 2026. ETNews says we’ll see an 8.7-inch iPad mini with OLED and a new 10.9-inch iPad Air with OLED in 2026. That’s a long way away so if you really want an OLED display on an iPad in the near future, you’ll have to buy a newer iPad Pro. We h...",2

Ever since Apple announced that it would accept pre-orders for the Vision Pro headset on January 19, I have been agonizing over whether or not I should get one. After quite a lot of thought and a long discussion with my wife, it has been decided that I will not be purchasing one -- at least not for now.  Also: This ultraportable VR headset gave me a taste of Vision Pro at a fraction of the cost A big part of the decision was the price. At $3,400, it's amazingly expensive, especially since I was able to buy a Meta Quest 3 headset for $650 (I paid an extra $150 for double storage on the Quest).  I'm still not sure what value the Vision Pro offers me, other than being able to write about it.  As my wife pointed out, we have a roof that needs urgent repairs (and budget dollars). It's not like I need a Vision Pro to watch movies. I already have a very nice TCL 65 inch Roku TVfor that.  I am having a hard time getting my head around the Vision Pro cost. For me, it would be an additional $150 for prescription lenses, bringing the price to $3,550. And since Apple is very clear that it needs to size the device to individual faces, it's unlikely I'd be able to conveniently share the headset with my wife, who is also an avid Apple ecosystem participant.  Speaking of the Apple ecosystem, let's break down what it would cost to own one of each category of products Apple offers (not counting the Vision Pro). As the table below shows, I could buy an iPhone, an iPad, a Mac, and an Apple Watch for $1,756.  So, let's see what happens if I add in some AirPods, a Quest 3, and even...",-2
Apple Ditches Blood Oxygen Feature on Its Watches to Escape Import Ban,2024-01-16T16:30:00+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/apple-watch-ditches-feature-sidestep-import-ban-masimo-1851168649,"Apple has finally come up with a workaround for the recent ban on two of its watches: the Apple Watch Series 9 and the Ultra 2. It will ditch the blood oxygen measurement feature on its watches altogether. The Cupertino giant has long been stuck in legal issues with California-based health-tech company Masimo, which manufactures blood oxygen monitoring tech. Masimo claims that Apple approached the company for collaboration in 2013 and allegedly violated two patents. It’s been years since the two companies have been going back and forth fighting a legal battle. In 2021, Masimo filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission and requested  an import ban on specific Apple Watch models. Apple was hopeful that the Biden administration would come to its rescue and veto the import ban.  Biden couldn’t save Apple, though, and the Series 9 and Ultra 2 were taken off the shelves of Apple retail stores on December 21. They were still available at third-party retailers such as Target, Best Buy, and Apple’s shop. Just a few days later, on December 24, they were also taken down from the website.  Since the ban, Apple has been trying to come up with a way to circumvent it and proposed dropping the feature on the two Apple watches mentioned above. The US Customs Agency was then appointed to determine whether the solution was enough to avoid a ban. 9to5Mac recently posted an official letter from Masimo’s attorney and reported that the feature will finally be dropped. Masimo’s letter confirmed that they agreed on the proposed solution.  Mark Gurman at Bloomberg reported that the new watches without the oximeter feature have been shipped to retailers in the US. Still, they’re not allowed to start selling them until they receive an official word from Apple’s corporate office.",-2
Supreme Court rejects App Store appeal in ruling that may cost Apple billions,2024-01-16T16:23:44+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/01/16/business/supreme-court-rejects-apples-appeal-of-app-store-changes/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 The Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed a court order to take effect that could loosen Apple’s grip on its lucrative iPhone app store, potentially siphoning billions of dollars away from one of the world’s most profitable companies. The justices rejected Apple’s appeal of lower-court rulings that found some of Apple’s app store rules for apps purchased on more than 1 billion iPhones constitute unfair competition under California law. The appeal stemmed from an antitrust lawsuit filed by Epic Games, maker of the popular Fortnite video game. Epic lost its broader claim that Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple was violating federal antitrust law, and the justices also rejected Epic’s appeal Tuesday. But in turning away Apple’s plea, the court lifted a hold on an order to allow app developers throughout the US to insert links to other payment options besides its own within iPhone apps. That change would make it easier for developers to avoid paying Apple’s commissions ranging from 15% to 30%. Those fees have turned into a significant part of Apple’s service’s division, which generated $85 billion in revenue during the company’s last fiscal year ending in September. The specter of consumers being able to defect to other payment channels for in-app transactions is one of several factors that has been weighing on Apple’s stock, which has declined 5% so far this year. The drop has enabled Apple’s long-time rival, Microsoft, to eclipse it as the world’s most valuable company. Apple’s shares declined by 2% in Tuesday’s early afternoon trading, leaving the company with a market value of about $2.8 trillion. Microsoft, whose stock has edged up 3% so far this year, is valued at $2.9 trillion. Besides the possibility of the Supreme Court refusing to consider the payment issue in the Epic case, investors also have been fretting about new European regulations scheduled to take effect in March that also could force Apple to allow alternate payment methods inside iPhone apps. Apple has staunchly resisted taking down the barriers, citing security concerns that could hurt iPhone owners. Epic, based in Cary, NC, had claimed that Apple’s app store — which was launched in 2008, a year after the first iPhone went on sale — had turned into an illegal monopoly that stifles innovation and competition while generating billions of dollars in profit for Apple. Although a federal judge rejected the assertion that Apple had a monopoly on mobile apps, she concluded consumers should have more discretion in how to pay inside apps. Apple didn’t immediately respond for comment on the Supreme Court’s rebuff or how it would adopt the September 2021 ruling handed down by U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. In series of posts Tuesday, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called the Supreme Court’s denial a “ sad outcome for developers” while also applauding the prospect of enabling consumers to see “ better prices on the web.” Back in August ...",-2
"Supreme Court declines to hear Apple-Epic antitrust case, meaning developers can point customers to the web",2024-01-16T16:14:09+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-epic-antitrust-case-meaning-developers-can-point-customers-to-the-web/,"The Supreme Court has denied both Apple and Fortnite maker Epic Games’ request to appeal a lower court’s ruling on the alleged anticompetitive nature of Apple’s App Store. The decision to not hear the case was a bit of a surprise, given that a jury trial recently found Google guilty in a similar antitrust battle with Epic. With the nation’s highest court refusing to weigh in on Apple’s status, that means the original ruling still stands. Apple had largely won its case, as the judge decided that Apple had not engaged in anticompetitive practices. However, there was one area where Apple would have to cede ground to developers, the court had ruled — it said that app makers should be able to steer their customers to the web from links inside their apps. This upset to Apple’s “anti-steering” rules for its App Store is what originally prompted the tech giant’s appeal. It does not want to allow app developers to market their own websites and payment mechanisms from inside iOS apps, which could reduce the purchases made on its App Store — and therefore Apple’s cut of developer revenues through its commissions. Developers, however, want to have a direct relationship with their customers. And for consumers, there may be a benefit to transacting on the web as the in-app purchases or subscriptions may be available for less than in the App Store, as the developer no longer has to pay the “Apple tax,” or commissions. In a statement, Epic Games’ CEO Tim Sweeney dubbed the Supreme Court’s decision to not take up the case as a “sad outcome for all developers,” but proclaimed that the “fight goes on.” “The Supreme Court denied both sides’ appeals of the Epic v. Apple antitrust case. The court battle to open iOS to competing stores and payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all developers,” said Sweeney in a prepared statement. Now the District Court’s injunction against Apple’s anti-steering rule is in effect, and developers can include in their apps ‘buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to IAP,'” he continued. “As of today, developers can begin exercising their court-established right to tell U.S. customers about better prices on the web. These awful Apple-mandated confusion screens are over and done forever. The fight goes on. Regulators are taking action and policymakers around the world are passing new laws to end Apple’s illegal anticompetitive app store practices. The European Union’s Digital Markets Act goes into effect March 7,” noted Sweeney. The Supreme Court denied both sides’ appeals of the Epic v. Apple antitrust case.

Supreme Court Rejects Apple’s Bid For Epic App Store Review,2024-01-16T16:11:42+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/supreme-court-rejects-apple-s-request-for-epic-app-store-review,"(Bloomberg) -- The US Supreme Court refused to consider Apple Inc.’s appeal in an antitrust suit challenging its lucrative App Store, a decision that will likely affect billions of dollars in revenue for the iPhone maker. Both Apple and  maker Epic Games Inc. had asked the court to hear an appeal related to the case. The justices turned down both appeals without explanation. Apple fell 2.6% to $181.09 at 9:51 a.m. in New York. The high court’s decision will allow an appeals court ruling go into effect, letting developers direct iPhone users to cheaper purchasing options outside of Apple’s system. The company charges developers a commission of as much as 30% for digital goods and services sold through its App Store. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals found last year that Apple violated California’s Unfair Competition Law by limiting the ability of developers to communicate about alternative payment systems. The decision, which had been on hold while the Supreme Court appeals were pending, will let developers circumvent those commissions by including links to process payments on the web instead of within the Apple system. The Epic case was the first to challenge Apple’s lucrative App Store system, which rakes in billions of dollars each year. The company has come under serious pressure around the world, including in Europe where competition enforcers have two antitrust cases pending against the tech giant.  In a separate Epic suit in December, a jury found that Alphabet Inc.’s Google unfairly wields monopoly power in its Android app store. Google has said it plans to appeal, but key legislation in Europe, investigations in the US and UK and an expected wave of follow-on lawsuits will keep pressure on the tech giants’ app store duopoly. Billions of dollars are at stake: in-app spending is forecast to reach $182 billion this year and $207 billion in 2025, according to research firm Sensor Tower. And competitors are ready to steal a piece of it: Microsoft Corp. has said that it’s already in talks to launch a mobile app store focused on gaming. Epic’s case against Apple’s App Store policies was mostly unsuccessful, with a federal judge ruling the iPhone maker’s practices don’t violate federal antitrust law. She did determine that under California law, Apple can’t restrict app owners from telling consumers that other payment systems exist and inviting them to access the apps outside of Apple’s system. Both parts of the trial judge’s decision were upheld on appeal. The cases are Apple v. Epic, 23-244, and Epic v. Apple, 23-337. (Updates with shares in third paragraph.)

Paul Walter Hauser promoted his indie match with Matt Cardona in Emmy acceptance speech,2024-01-16T15:51:59+00:00,https://www.cagesideseats.com/indies-independent-wrestling-indy-promotions/2024/1/16/24040005/paul-walter-hauser-emmy-speech-wrestling-references-indie-match-matt-cardona-kota-ibushi-ddp-tables,"Filed under: After winning the trophy for his work in ‘Blackbird’, the actor plugged his upcoming Wrestling Revolver showdown with the former Zack Ryder — and made a few other pro wrestling references. The Golden Globe Paul Walter Hauser won for his supporting role in Apple+’s Blackbird was used for an angle in AEW early last year*. Now the Emmy he was awarded for his portrayal of convicted serial killer and rapist Larry Hall in the limited series is part of the superfan-turned-pro wrestler’s feud with “Indy God” Matt Cardona. Hauser, who had his first official match at Wrestling Revolver’s Unreal event in Los Angeles last November, is scheduled to face Cardona for the same promotion on Mar. 16. And after his name was called as the winner of the Emmy for “Outstanding supporting actor in a limited or anthology series or movie” at the Jan. 15 ceremony, he thanked his collaborators, business people & family — then had a line in his prepared acceptance rhyme for the former Zack Ryder: “That’s a ‘what up’ to Jesus, he’s the soul owner,I own the body, I’m about to beat Matt Cardona” He wasn’t done representing his favorite pastime/newest side gig either. Injured Japanese star Kota Ibushi also got a shout out before Hauser closed with a phrase the Dudleys made famous: “Yo Ibushi, yoga and sushi on me if you’re able,Do things a little bit differentBrian Walsh, get the tables” Clearly prepared for the possibility he might pick up another trophy for his work on Blackbird at the strike-delayed award showed, Hauser also had text “thanks” displayed during his speech. WCW legend, WWE Hall of Famer & fitness guru Diamond Dallas Page got his kudos there. That graphic can be seen above, and shows up 26 seconds into this clip: Paul Walter Hauser wins the award for Supporting Actor - Limited Anthology Series or Movie at the #Emmys pic.twitter.com/tjRLaXe6tv Unfazed by the taunt, Cardona was just excited for the mention, quote-tweeting the above with “I was just name dropped on the #Emmys!” and a graphic for their upcoming match: The promotion also jumped at the chance to share the speech and plug Ready or Not. Bully Ray did the same, congratulating Hauser on his Emmy, saying he hopes he kicks Cardona’s ass, and adding “ps…love that ‘out’ line.”  Might not be the way WWE wanted it to, but pro wresting really just made the Emmys. I guess we really are in the “Mainstream Era”... * Honestly, I’m not sure Hauser ever got it back from Sonjay Dutt, Jay Lethal, Jeff Jarrett & Satnam Singh.  Check your inbox for a welcome email.

The Apple Vision Pro has a ‘guest’ mode for your friends to try it,2024-01-16T15:50:27+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24039995/apple-vision-pro-guest-mode-friends,"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Apple’s Vision Pro headset will come with an option that lets you share it with friends and family members — a feature currently available on nearly every other headset. In a press release on Tuesday, Apple says you can let a “guest user” who’s not registered to the device try out certain apps and experiences, without needing to set up an account on the device. Although not explicitly mentioned by Apple, it seems guest users will be able to bypass the headset’s Optic ID requirement that unlocks the device upon scanning your iris. Apple doesn’t go into too much detail about how this will all work, but the company notes guests may access “some app content, such as large photo attachments, in Messages” while the Settings app is open. Additionally, Apple says it will restrict Apple ID settings, Optic ID, passcode, passwords, Apple Pay, Persona, and health data while a guest is using the headset. When Apple first announced the Vision Pro headset, the company never made it clear how or if you could share the $3,499 device. But last year, 9to5Mac found a “Guest Mode” available within the visionOS software development kit, which would let users create a password that gives their friend or family member access to the Vision Pro’s app. Apple didn’t confirm the feature’s existence until now. Along with a mention of guest users, Apple also confirmed rumors that you’ll be able to use a travel mode “to stabilize visuals” if you ever get the urge to use it while on a plane. The Vision Pro will come with 3D movies and experiences from Disney Plus as well as support for streaming apps like Amazon Prime Video, Paramount Plus, Peacock, and others when it launches on February 2nd.   / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

 and when apple bans apps that do this? It is easier than that. They can require that any link be directly to the developer's website where it is processed, and that the developer be PCI-compliant. They can also ban ""free"" apps with external payment mechanisms. There are all kinds of games they can play to make it impractical to run alternatives. To expect the SCOTUS to step in and enact your views into laws, regardless of whomever else's you might steam-roll over; is wrong.My kingdom for mod points. Alas... none today. To expect the SCOTUS to step in and enact your views into laws, regardless of whomever else's you might steam-roll over; is wrong. My kingdom for mod points. Alas... none today. IANAL, but it seems to me SCOTUS has implicitly accepted the Appeals Court ruling accepting the trial court’s definition of the market. Now a judge’s ruling here could be considered as a matter of law (vs of fact, which is jury business.) So at a minimum, this could set up a basis for Google to appeal the ruling in its case, and if Google loses, that could then set up a potential for further SCOTUS ruling on ‘legal definition of a market.’ The ‘market definition’ is at the absolute core of these anti-trust cases. So if I were doing Apple’s legal strategy (or other big tech firm), I’d be looking for both certainty and favorable rulings-of-law on -my- preferred market definition. Google's market definition was set by the jury in trial court.  Apple's was set by the judge and affirmed by the appeals court and implicitly by SCOTUS.  So it's not clear to me how strong the Apple precedent is. I was surprised the judge assigned the market definition to the jury in the Google case.  I thought that would have been a 'ruling of law'. Suprme Court denials are not affirmations of lower court rulings and don't set precedent. The supreme court only hears so many cases, and sometimes things get denied not because they are correct but because they don't have enough care.While it's true that they don't set precedent, they do allow the precedent set by the lower court to stand. Should different precedents emerge from different districts, it may then be worth the Supreme Court's time to weigh in, but until they do the existing precedent stands in that district and could become the basis for similar rulings in other districts.

Beeper users say Apple is now blocking their Macs from using iMessage entirely,2024-01-16T15:43:52+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/16/beeper-users-say-apple-is-now-blocking-their-macs-from-using-imessage-entirely/,"The Apple-versus-Beeper saga is not over yet it seems, even though the iMessage-on-Android Beeper Mini was removed from the Play Store last week. Now, Apple customers who used Beeper’s apps are reporting that they’ve been banned from using iMessage on their Macs — a move Apple may have taken to disable Beeper’s apps from working properly, but ultimately penalizes its own customers for daring to try a non-Apple solution for accessing iMessage. The latest follows a contentious game of cat-and-mouse between Apple and Beeper, which Apple ultimately won. Beeper, a startup from Pebble smartwatch founder Eric Migicovsky, had originally developed a messaging app aggregator that allowed users to check their messages from across services like WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Instagram, Signal, Telegram, SMS and iMessage all in one place. That product was renamed Beeper Cloud with the launch of a new app for Android users, Beeper Mini, which offered access to iMessage to Android users. But the latter only found short-lived success, as Apple quickly figured out how to disable Beeper Mini from being able to reliably deliver messages. Even after Beeper rolled out a fix, Apple once again targeted Beeper’s users, blocking their messages. The tech giant’s actions soon caught the attention of lawmakers, leading a bipartisan group of legislators to implore the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate Apple’s “potential anticompetitive treatment” of the Beeper Mini application. Now, users of Beeper’s applications are complaining on public forums, including Reddit and Discord, that Beeper’s desktop application (Beeper Cloud) has led to their Mac computers no longer being able to send and receive any iMessage texts. According to users’ recounting of their tech support experiences with Apple, the support reps are telling them their computer has been flagged for spam, or for sending too many messages — even though that’s not the case, some argued. This has led many Beeper users to believe this is how Apple is flagging them for removal from the iMessage network. One Beeper customer advised others facing this problem to ask Apple if their Mac was in a “throttled status” or if their Apple ID was blocked for spam to get to the root of the issue. Admitting up front that third-party software was to blame would sometimes result in the support rep being able to lift the ban, some noted. The news of the Mac bans was earlier reported by Apple news site AppleInsider and Times of India, and is being debated on Y Combinator forum site Hacker News. On the latter, some express their belief that the retaliation against Apple’s own users is justified as they had violated Apple’s terms, while others said that iMessage interoperability should be managed through regulation, not rogue apps.

Supreme Court rejects Epic v. Apple antitrust case,2024-01-16T15:25:48+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24039983/supreme-court-epic-apple-antitrust-case-rejected,"By  Adi Robertson, a senior tech and policy editor focused on VR, online platforms, and free expression. Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.  The Supreme Court has denied a request to hear an antitrust dispute between Apple and Fortnite publisher Epic Games. It rejected two petitions, one from each company, this morning — leaving the case largely, but not entirely, a win for Apple. Epic v. Apple began in 2020 after Epic implemented its own payment system for Fortnite’s virtual currency, bypassing Apple’s commission on in-app purchases. Apple banned Epic from its iOS App Store and Epic filed a lawsuit in response, claiming the App Store — and Apple’s overall walled-garden approach to iOS — violated US antitrust laws. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers rejected most of Apple’s claims and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals largely affirmed the decision. Even so, both rulings found that Apple had acted anticompetitively by barring developers from telling users about other payment methods. Apple was ordered to let them allow links and other “calls to action” that would bypass Apple’s payment system, discontinuing what are known as anti-steering policies. But the company spent years delaying parts of the change with legal appeals, winning a reprieve while the Supreme Court considered the case. Today’s denial seemingly runs out that clock, requiring Apple to reconsider the future of its anti-steering rules. Conversely, Epic remains unsuccessful in its bid to make Apple allow it back onto the App Store or let developers distribute apps via sideloading or third-party stores. The outcome is strikingly different from its recent victory over Apple’s rival Google in a California jury trial — although Google has said it will appeal the decision. Apple may also face more pressure to open up iOS in Europe; it’s currently fighting attempts to regulate the App Store under the EU’s Digital Markets Act, which goes into effect on March 7th. In a thread of social media posts, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said that “the court battle to open iOS to competing stores and payments is lost in the United States,” dubbing it “a sad outcome for all developers.” But he celebrated the end of anti-steering rules, urging developers to “begin exercising their court-established right to tell US customers about better prices on the web.” Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Supreme Court’s decision. Correction 11:00AM ET: The DMA goes into effect March 7th, not March 6th. We regret the error.

iPhone 15 Storage: Which Size Should You Buy?,2024-01-24T23:12:58+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/iphone-15-storage/,"Published on By Choosing an iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro storage size can be tricky so we want to help you decide between Apple’s cheapest options, the middle-of-the-road options, and the most expensive versions of Apple’s flagship phones. While you might be tempted to buy the cheapest iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, or iPhone 15 Pro Max, or the variant with the most storage, a lot of people will be perfectly fine buying a model that falls in between. Table of Contents There are several factors you should consider before you settle on one storage size or another. We’ll break down everything you need to think about before you buy here in this guide. Apple offers three iPhone 15 storage options. The iPhone 15, like the iPhone 14, starts at 128GB. Apple, carriers, and retailers also sell 256GB and 512GB options for those who need more storage. The 128GB iPhone 15 is the cheapest option while, unsurprisingly, the 512GB model is the most expensive variant. Like the iPhone 15, the iPhone 15 Plus comes in three sizes: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. Apple’s higher-end iPhone 15 Pro comes in four different flavors.  The iPhone 15 Pro starts at 128GB. From there, the storage capacity goes up to 256GB, 512GB and 1TB. The most expensive iPhone 15 model is the iPhone 15 Pro Max and it comes in three sizes: 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. Apple doesn’t offer a 128GB iPhone 15 Pro Max model. The iPhone 15 series, like its predecessors, doesn’t have a microSD card slot for expanded storage. If you want to add additional storage to your new iPhone, you’ll need to use iCloud or buy a USB-C compatible drive. If you plan to shoot high-resolution videos and photos, download movies or songs, or play games on your device, you’ll need quite a bit of storage space. While 128GB or 256GB might seem like it’s enough, there’s a chance your storage fills up quick. At that point you’ll be forced to continuously delete files you no longer need, buy a compatible drive, or pay for iCloud. Fortunately, Apple’s iCloud storage solution is pretty inexpensive. You can get 50GB of cloud storage for just a dollar a month. Here’s how the pricing breaks down: You can also share iCloud storage with your family members. No, we don’t expect Apple to add new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro storage sizes in 2024. What you see is what you get. If you want more storage, you might want to wait for the iPhone 16 series. It may include a larger variant. The 128GB iPhone 15 models are the cheapest models Apple offers and they should be considered if you don’t think of yourself as a power user.  Here are a few reasons why you might want to buy the company’s 128GB iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, or iPhone 15 Pro: The 256GB variant is a middle of the road choice for prospective iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus users. It’s the second largest option for the iPhone 15 Pro and offers the least amount of storage on the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Here are some reasons why you should buy the 256GB iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pr...",1

Apple TV+ has the pair’s newest collaboration that is chock full of up-and-coming actors and a few already decorated stars, including Austin Butler (Elvis, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood) and Barry Keoghan (Saltburn, The Batman), leading the way. The series is based upon Donald L. Miller’s book, Masters of the Air: America’s Bomber Boys Who Fought the Air War Against Nazi Germany, and closely follows the “Bloody Hundredth,” i.e. the 100th Bomb Group, while they conduct targeted raids on Germany. They will be exposed to grave danger during daring missions, wrestle with the elements, and above all, try their hardest to get each other home in one piece.  Camaraderie will also be had, but those moments will be few and far between as teammates begin to fall, and replacement troops grow younger and more inexperienced, and the war drags on. Yet the series does not slow down. Apple TV+ will debut the show on Friday, January 26, 2024 by streaming two upfront episodes. From there, you can expect weekly drops until March 15, 2024.

iPhone 12 Problems: 5 Things You Need to Know,2024-01-24T22:29:01+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/iphone-12-problems-5-things-you-need-to-know/,"Published on By Problems are plaguing iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max users. iPhone 12 users are complaining about a wide variety of issues ranging from minor bugs to serious performance issues. And while some of these issues will likely be resolved by Apple in future iOS 17 updates, more problems will popup as people put more wear and tear on their devices. In the guide below, you can learn about the current state of iPhone 12 issues, potential fixes for these problems, places to find feedback, and what’s next from Apple in terms of iOS 17 updates. Table of Contents If you’re having issues activating your phone, check Apple’s System Status page. If you don’t see a green symbol next to iOS Device Activation, you’ll want to wait until it’s green and then try activating the phone again. If it’s green and the process still isn’t working, make sure you have a SIM card inserted in your iPhone. If you’re receiving a “No Sim” or “Invalid SIM” error, you’ll want to head to this guide for assistance. We’re also hearing about the following issues: Owners of the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12, both of which employ a design with aluminum edges, are reportedly seeing discoloration on the chassis. On top of that, iPhone 12 users are complaining about 5G/LTE issues. Some users are saying cellular service is dropping unexpectedly while on-the-go. If you’re thinking about buying an iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, or an iPhone 12 Pro Max, or if you already own one, you’ll want to monitor feedback from those who have adopted these devices. This feedback will alert you to potential issues with the hardware and software. We recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter, and sites like the MacRumors forums for ongoing feedback about the phones. If you’re thinking about moving to Apple’s iOS 17 firmware, or if you’ve already made the move, take a look at our guide that covers the latest version of the software. We’ve also released a quick review that covers the performance of the most up-to-date version of iOS 17, iOS 17.4.1. If you run into a problem, there’s no need to panic. There’s a good chance you’ll be able to avoid taking your new device into an Apple Store or your local carrier store for assistance. First, take a look at our list of fixes for the most common iPhone 12 problems. It will take you through fixes for common issues like broken Bluetooth and busted Wi-Fi. We’ve also released some tips to help you improve performance and a guide that could help you improve your phone’s battery life if you start noticing abnormal drain.  If you can’t find a fix for your issue(s) in our guides, you’ll want to check Apple’s discussion forums and see if someone has a fix for your problem(s). If you can’t find anything there, it’s time to get in touch with Apple. You can get in contact with Apple Support via the company’s website. If you’d rather explain your issue in person, you shou...",1

Apple’s 2024 is off to a rough start,2024-01-24T20:03:55+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-2024-is-off-to-a-rough-start-200355426.html,"We’re less than a month into the new year, but it feels like it’s been a heck of a lot longer for Apple (AAPL) watchers. The tech giant has been making headlines left and right as it juggles a handful of downgrades to its stock price, faces required major changes to its App Store policies, and gears up for a potential antitrust lawsuit that could target large swaths of its business. All of this comes as Apple prepares to launch its $3,499 Vision Pro headset. Apple’s most ambitious product in years, the Vision Pro catapults the company into a product category that even established players like Meta (META) have struggled to turn into a hit. It’s a lot to say the least. But it’s not all doom and gloom for Apple. Generative AI-equipped iPhones and a reacceleration of the company’s services business should help goose growth in the years ahead. And if the Vision Pro takes off, it would provide an entirely new revenue stream across both Apple’s hardware and services segments. “I don't think Apple's in any way under any existential threat right now that didn't exist before,” Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance. “It's just that they're participating in markets that [have] slower growth and they're looking for ways to try to juice that growth.” China is Apple’s third-largest market, generating $72.6 billion of the company’s $383.3 billion in total revenue in 2023. North America, Apple’s biggest market, generated $162.6 billion, while Europe generated $94.3 billion. All this makes reports of a slowdown in iPhone sales in China perhaps Apple’s biggest and most pressing story. A sluggish economic recovery coupled with a resurgent Huawei, which despite US sanctions has managed to put out smartphones with modern processors and features, are expected to hurt Apple’s market share in the country. According to Counterpoint Research, the iPhone maker controlled 15% of the Chinese market in Q3 2023. That was slightly better than Huawei’s 14%, but behind Vivo’s 16% and Oppo’s 19%. Analysts at Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic each pointed to the region as a potential problem for Apple with Barclays’s Tim Long saying that the firm saw “incrementally worse” iPhone 15 data out of China. He also added that he doesn’t predict any “features or upgrades that are likely to make the iPhone 16 more compelling.” Redburn Atlantic’s James Cordwell also called out China in a Jan. 10 note, saying that he remains concerned about Apple’s competitive position in the country. Piper Sandler’s Harsh Kumar and Robert Aguanno said that the deteriorating macro environment in China could weigh on Apple’s handset business. “We highlight in our outlook that China is a key swing factor for sales next year,” Aguanno told Yahoo Finance. “Any recovery in expectations for iPhone growth will be fueled by either the reemergence of the Chinese consumer along with outsized growth in other emerging markets such as India.” Apple is also contending with r...",-2

Apple iOS 17.3: how to use iPhone's Stolen Device Protection,2024-01-24T19:37:20+00:00,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tech/apple-ios-17-3-how-use-stolen-device-protection-iphone-b1134593.html,"News | Tech Getting your iPhone nicked is devastating enough, but what if the thieves have your passcode to boot? Previously, this nightmare scenario allowed criminals to lock you out, block Apple’s Find My iPhone app, and potentially empty your bank accounts. Fortunately, Apple has released a new security setting aimed at making lost or stolen iPhones virtually impenetrable. Once you’ve downloaded iOS 17.3, you should have the new feature on your device. But, you still need to turn it on — here’s how to activate it. Firstly, make sure you’ve installed iOS 17.3. Even if you have automatic updates enabled, there’s still a chance it may not have downloaded by itself.  If that’s the case, head to general > software update > and select update now under iOS 17.3. Just make sure your iPhone has enough juice, otherwise it won’t work. With the update installed, go to settings > Face ID & Passcode. Now, enter your device passcode and then tap turn Stolen Device Protection on or off. While the new feature can’t prevent your iPhone from getting swiped, it can make it harder for thieves to break into it. Stolen Device adds additional layers of security when the device is outside of recognised locations, such as your home. What does it do? Well, it adds a one-hour delay when someone attempts to change an Apple ID password and will ask for an additional biometric check of your face or finger (for phones with Touch ID).  Accessing passwords and stored credit/debit card information will also require a biometric check. A passcode input won’t do as the idea is to make sure it’s the owner trying to access that information.  Of course, the phone has to be away from familiar locations, which include places you frequent — and the feature needs to be turned on for it to work Ultimately, it could give you extra peace of mind when your iPhone is lost or stolen, and even ensure that you can get it back.

The ‘Masters Of The Air’ Reviews Can’t Help But Feel Patriotic From The ‘Breathtaking’ Follow-Up To ‘Band Of Brothers’,2024-01-24T19:32:46+00:00,https://uproxx.com/tv/masters-of-the-air-reviews/,"After delivering the critically acclaimed series Band of Brothers and its follow-up The Pacific, executive producers are back with an all-new World War II tale: Masters of the Air. This time around, the WWII action will take place on Apple TV+ instead of HBO where Spielberg and Hanks previously unfolded their first two wartime epics. As for the setting, Masters of the Air takes the battle to the skies as the new series focuses on the real-life 100th Bomb Group and their harrowing missions to help defeat Germany. Starring Austin Butler, Callum Turner, and Barry Keoghan, Masters of the Air is already racking up rave reviews ahead of its two-part premiere that arrives later this week. You can see what the critics are saying below: Daniel Fienberg, The Hollywood Reporter: It is, mind you, a misnomer to say that anything associated with Masters of the Air is “small,” be it the screen or otherwise. Based on Donald L. Miller’s 2007 book of the same name and developed for Apple TV+ by John Orloff, Masters of the Air is, by any measure, huge. It boasts a mammoth ensemble of young stars in various states of ascension, requires an astonishing quantity of technical effects to achieve its high-flying narrative and, when its key moments land, is equal parts breathtaking, exhilarating and rousingly inspirational. Nick Schager, The Daily Beast: A sprawling 1943-1945 saga about the 100th Bomb Group that soars far more often than it falters, it romantically lionizes the bravery and commemorates the anguish and sacrifices of “the greatest generation” via muscular action and poignant drama that understands what war is, what it takes to triumph in it, and why those who risk it all in service of their country and the world deserve our highest respect. Rebecca Nicholson, The Guardian: At the heart of it all is the inseparable duo of Maj John “Bucky” Egan (Callum Turner) and Maj Gale “Buck” Cleven (Austin Butler). Bucky is a rabble-rouser and a drinker who fights with passion, while Buck is solid, sedate and tempers Bucky’s fire. Both actors are phenomenal. As quickly becomes clear, their missions are not so much fraught with danger as a compulsory ticket to a mortality lottery with dreadful odds. Every time they depart, there is no guarantee they will make it back. Luke Reilly, IGN: There is no doubt, however, that Masters of the Air is at its most thrilling in the skies, and the visual effects do a good job of translating both the violence and sheer velocity of WWII air combat to the screen. Viewed from the cockpits of the B-17s, watching the specks of dozens of enemy fighters manoeuvre at the American bombers is an intimidating sight – especially with the contrails they leave behind arcing out towards the formations like icy fingers.

Apple’s first Macintosh – a device that revolutionised personal computers – turns 40 today. The “game-changing” computer first went on sale on 24 January 1984, two days after being introduced to the world in a big-budget Super Bowl advert, by renowned British director Sir Ridley Scott. The advert, referencing George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984, was itself considered a watershed moment in advertising – later being described as “more successful than the Mac itself” by Apple’s then-marketing guru Regis McKenna…The advert ended with the tagline: “On 24 January, Apple will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like ‘1984’.” Sky News  Netflix sign-ups boomed at the end of last year as customers prodded by the firm’s crackdown on password-sharing created their own accounts. The streaming giant added more than 13.1 million subscriptions in the three months ended in December. That was the most for any quarter since 2020, extending a streak of growth that started last year. Netflix said it was confident in its growth path and was planning to raise prices. “We largely put price increases on hold as we rolled out paid sharing. Now that we’re through that, we’re able to resume our standard approach,” co-chief executive Greg Peters said. BBC  eBay is the latest tech firm to announce mass layoffs as it said it was cutting 1,000 jobs to “better position” the business for long-term growth. The decision will see the online marketplace axe 9% of its full-time global workforce, according to a memo written to employees by eBay chief executive Jamie Iannone. He said: “While we are making progress against our strategy, our overall headcount and expenses have outpaced the growth of our business. Retail Gazette  
Microsoft became the second-ever company to exceed a $3 trillion (£2.4 trillion) valuation on Wednesday, after its focus on artificial intelligence (AI) drove an investor rally. The valuation follows Apple hitting the milestone in June last year. Microsoft’s shares rose by more than 1.45pc during trading on Wednesday in New York, on a day when America’s benchmark S&P 500 index also hit a record high.

How to reconcile financial results pre- and post-IFRS 17,2024-01-24T19:10:08+00:00,https://www.canadianunderwriter.ca/earnings-ratings/how-to-reconcile-financial-results-pre-and-post-ifrs-17-1004242124/,"

 Insurance professionals looking to reconcile financial results pre- and post-IFRS 17 implementation need to understand specific accounting policy choices their company has taken because it’s “not going to be apples to apples right across the board,” a Wawanesa executive said. Traditionally, the measure of profitability within the P&C insurance world has always been the combined operating ratio (COR) and this will continue, said Gord Dowhan, chief financial officer and senior vice president with Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company. With insurers reporting under the IFRS 17 insurance accounting standard since the beginning of 2023, and the first audited financial statements to be issued in early in 2024, it’s important to know which COR is being used. There are three different CORs that are now commonly applied: “The initial discounting on claims goes into your Insurance Service expense,” which captures claims and underwriting expenses in IFRS 17, Dowhan explained. Related: How Canada’s P&C insurers are faring under IFRS 17 “And that’s where COR is measured, but the changes in discount rates — and we’re seeing a lot of those in the last 18 months — as well as the unwind of discount rates actually goes below the line into Finance Expense,” he said. “So, that’s not captured in the IFRS 17 COR.” Insurance expense is part of Net Insurance Service results and includes claims incurred, risk adjustment, loss component from onerous contracts, acquisition expenses and fulfillment expenses. Finance Expense includes the cost of amortization/movement in discount rates when revaluing insurance contract liabilities. Essentially, as rates change there is revaluation of insurance contract liabilities. To present financial information in today’s dollars, companies would have an amount that was discounted previously, and they would adjust the amount based on the change in rates. This is referred to as the unwind of discounting; the size of the unwind depends on the interest rate levels of prior periods. A lot of companies are including both IFRS 4 and 17 CORs. Still, it’s crucial to understand accounting policy choices, which may not be publicly available for non-publicly traded companies. “It’s so important that when you’re looking at financial statements, looking at [key performance indicators], you understand what is actually included in there,” Dowhan said during AM Best’s Canada Insurance Market Briefing in Toronto last October. “Is it the component which is in Insurance Service expense? Or is it the component within the Finance Expense? Related: Do you know what’s a material change in IFRS 17? “You need to understand those accounting policy choices that the company has taken because it’s not going to be apples to apples right across the board,” he said during a panel discussion called Implications of IFRS 17. Another factor to look at is return on equity (ROE) and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), both are im...",0
"Apple plots fees, restrictions in Europe on downloads outside App Store: report",2024-01-24T19:01:46+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/01/24/business/apple-plots-fees-restrictions-in-europe-on-downloads-outside-app-store/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Apple is reportedly preparing to impose new fees and restrictions on software downloads outside of its App Store — in what could be a “major test” of Europe’s attempts to enforce a sweeping law aimed at boosting tech competition. It’s part of the Cupertino, Calif. tech giant’s effort to comply with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act ahead of a March 7 deadline — while also maintaining its hold on revenue generated by software downloads on its device. Apple will allow iPhone users to download apps from other app stores for the first time ever as part of the plan – a practice known as “sideloading.”  Nevertheless, Apple will still maintain the power to review all apps downloaded from other app stores onto its devices, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the company’s thinking. Apple also will charge fees from developers who offer downloads separate from the App Store. The size of those potential fees was not immediately known.  The plan would only apply to Europe, not the US market. If it is enacted, Apple’s plan could face opposition from software developers who expected to offer downloads without such restrictions, the report noted.  It also remains to be seen if EU regulators will consider the plan to be compliant with its rules — or as an effort by Apple to skirt attempts to loosen its dominant hold on the app marketplace. To that end, European Commission officials have reportedly met with Apple and other tech firms to go over their plans to comply.  That included a meeting earlier this month between Apple CEO Tim Cook and EU Commissioner executive vice president Margrethe Vestager, a top antitrust official, according to the Journal. At the time, Vestager told reporters that Europe “stands absolutely ready to do noncompliance cases” if necessary. The Journal’s sources said Apple spent “more than a year” crafting its plan to address the European law. Apple has yet to formally announce any details of its plans and the Journal said they could still change. The Post has reached out to Apple for comment. Apple shares were flat in trading Wednesday. Apple has long argued that it needs to maintain strict supervision over app downloads to ensure user privacy and device security.  Meanwhile, Apple’s detractors have routinely blasted the steep fees it charges — including a 30% cut of App Store sales — and alleged boosting of its own apps. The report noted that several competitors, including Spotify, Meta and Microsoft, are crafting potential strategies to capitalize on the law through their own app download offerings. The Digital Markets Act is aimed at six companies that have been deemed “gatekeepers” of the broader internet: Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, TikTok parent ByteDance, Facebook and Instagram parent Meta and Microsoft. The law, which took effect in November 2022, is aimed at creating a...",-2
Looking back on 40 years of Macintosh,2024-01-24T19:00:00+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/24047857/macintosh-40th-anniversary-apple-imac-powerbook-macbook-studio-pro-air,"By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. The Apple we know today is far removed from the one that created the first Macintosh computer that Steve Jobs showed off in a very silly presentation on January 24th, 1984. It’s been the most valuable company in the world for most of the last decade. It has a global, meticulously curated supply chain, retail stores around the world, and near-constant legal and regulatory trouble. And its primary hardware driver is a phone. But Apple still makes the Macintosh, and some would argue that we’re living in a new golden age for the machines. They’re faster than ever and as sleek as any made during Jony Ive’s time going ham on the company’s industrial design, but they’re also practical in a way they haven’t been since MacBooks started abandoning all but the USB-C ports in 2015. The Macintosh line has had plenty of fantastic computers over the years, and just about all of them have at least a small and dedicated group of fans (even the lowly Performa 550, aka the first computer I ever owned). But there are plenty, too, that have left an indelible mark on the computing world and even society at large. The iPhone might be Apple’s bread and butter these days, but its 15-plus years of being a flat thing with a screen has nowhere near as many ups and downs as the last 40 years of the Mac. Apple’s first few years of Macintoshes didn’t take root in every home, but they did leave a big impression on the world: They kicked off the desktop publishing revolution, thanks to their introduction of the computer mouse and software like Aldus PageMaker.  The pinnacle of these beige all-in-ones with black-and-white screens was the Macintosh SE/30 in 1989. It looked a lot like the first Mac, but it was faster, could be equipped with an internal hard drive, and it supported up to 32MB of RAM (though you could ultimately cram in 128MB). Just about every part of it was accessible and upgradeable, including the CPU.  Apple desktops in the 1990s didn’t make the same splash. In fact, the company was nearing bankruptcy by the time Steve Jobs returned to it in late 1996, thanks to a run of computers that were less capable than competing PCs and just as plain to look at. But the company still made moves that set the course for modern computers, particularly when it came to the laptop. The PowerBook 100 in 1991 set the standard for laptop layouts when it moved the keyboard back from the front edge and stuck a mouse input in the palm rest area (in this case, a trackball). Practically every laptop since has followed that design. You’re not stretching things if you say there would be no modern-day Apple without the iMac — it saved the company with its translucent plastic exterior and friendly face, and it came with USB ports, a first for M...",2
The 7th Gen iPad is now a bargain Apple tablet,2024-01-24T18:49:42+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/deals/the-7th-gen-ipad-is-now-a-bargain-apple-tablet-4410560,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience. If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. If you’re looking for an Apple iPad, but don’t need the top specs for sending email, browsing the web and enjoying video, Amazon has a great option for you. The retailer is selling a refurbished 7th Generation iPad for just £164 right now. This is the 2019 release of the iPad and still offers support for the latest version of the software – iPadOS 17. iPad 10.2-inch (7th Gen) for £164 refurbished The iPad 7 (10.2-inch) can be snagged for just £164 right now. It’s a refurbished model in excellent condition and comes with very buyer-friendly terms!
 The iPad 7 (10.2-inch) can be snagged for just £164 right now. It’s a refurbished model in excellent condition and comes with very buyer-friendly terms! This model has a 10.2-inch Retina display with a 2160 x 1620 resolution and 32GB of storage. This model has an A10 Fusion processor from Apple with battery life rated at 10-hours. There’s also a Touch ID fingerprint sensor planted within the Home button (for authenticating accounts and Apple Pay transactions), as well as an 8-megapixel rear camera and 1.2-megapixel FaceTime HD cam. There’s also support for the Apple Smart Keyboard case and the Apple Pencil. Amazon promises the refurbished product is in excellent condition (no signs of cosmetic damage visible from a distance of 30 centimetres) and fully functional. The battery will have 80% capacity relative to new, while accessories are included but may not be originals. It’s eligible for replacement or refund within a year if the product doesn’t work as expected, so it’s risk free. We gave this model a 4.5 star review back in December 2019, praising the affordability, iPadOS software, support for Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard, and the larger than before 10.2-inch display. Our reviewer concluded: “There’s no denying this is a great, even fantastic, tablet that’s easy to recommend. If you want to upgrade an older iPad to a device that feels slicker, offers integration with the Apple Keyboard and Apple Pencil and has a larger display, then you’ll feel right at home with the iPad 7.” If you’re looking to save big on an iPad and don’t mind the absence of brand new model, then this is a great option that’ll do the job for you with a relatively risk-free warranty.

Wired headphones are about to have a mini revival,2024-01-24T18:45:34+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/wired-headphones-apple-hi-res-lossless-184534388.html?src=rss,"It’s been over seven years since Apple found the “courage” to remove the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone, in turn forcing wireless headphones into the limelight. To this day, listening to hi-res lossless music on a phone usually means a hunt for a rare handset with a 3.5mm jack or accepting your new dongle life. As if from nowhere, a new breed of wired headphone has emerged, and it promises audiophile quality on any phone with no need for a dongle. Of course there’s a marketing term to go with it: True Lossless Earphones (TLE). You might not have heard of Questyle, but the company has been making hobbyist HiFi gear for years. Last November, the company tried something different with its NHB12 Lightning headphones. The IEM-style buds incorporate a digital audio converter (DAC) capable of handling Apple Music’s top-tier Hi-Res Lossless files (192kHz/24-bit). Ahead of CES this month, the company released a USB-C version — the $350 NHB15 — bringing its all-in-one hi-res digital headphone to almost every other phone, tablet or PC. Two days after Questyle announced the NHB15, rival company Hidizs claimed that its own DAC-packing ST2 Pro model was the world’s first hi-res digital IEM. It’s not quite a trend yet, but expect a mini wave of similar products to follow and I’m not sure it matters who was first. What’s more interesting is that, with iPhones switching to USB-C and plug-and-play hi-res options on the table, all the ingredients are there for mini wired headphone revival — although I don’t think it would last and we’ll get to why later. It’s worth noting that all these USB-C headphones have some sort of DAC in them, but rarely are they hi-res capable. “Hi-res” audio is a broad term, but here we’re following Apple’s own language, which is anything above 48kHz. In recent years, some HiFi companies have released USB-C cables with DACs in them that support higher resolutions. Queststyle and Hidizs are just taking it to the next logical conclusion by bundling everything together — which is what makes them more interesting to the casual (but audio curious) listener. I’ve tried a fair few standalone DACs over my years here at Engadget and I appreciate the superior audio quality they provide, but I never found one I’d use while out and about. There are some that come close, like the fantastic DragonFly Cobalt by AudioQuest or the sleek Onyx by THX but they all require something between your phone and your headphones — by which time I’ll just reach for my best wireless set and be done. The NHB15 though, I could see myself using these on the regular. The experience is no more complicated than connecting a regular 3.5mm set. The DAC isn’t invisible; at first you might think it was in-line, yoke-style media controls. In fact, if this had buttons on it that would both complete the illusion and add handy functionality, but for now it’s purely there to turn your music from zeros and ones into audible sound. LEDs let you know if you’re slumming it with loss...",2
How Apple's AI advances could make or break the iPhone 16,2024-01-24T18:42:36+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-apples-ai-advances-could-make-or-break-the-iphone-16/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular Wall Street is predicting a rough 2024 for Apple's iPhone franchise because of a lack of interesting new hardware features. Could artificial intelligence software make an iPhone 16 shine brighter? Some Apple stock bulls think so. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring this month opined that 2024 ""will be the year that Apple's 'Edge AI' opportunity comes to fruition,"" and that it could power the new crop of iPhones this fall to greater heights.  Also: The iPhone 16 Ultra camera will integrate the biggest leap in photos since B&W-to-color  Apple's iPhone  sales, led by the current iPhone 15, are expected to decline by about 2% this year, according to estimates compiled by FactSet Systems, to 229 million units, as the current iPhone cycle underwhelms with merely iterative hardware features.  But come 2025, wrote analyst Woodring, current Wall Street expectations for growth of 4%, to 237 million units, could turn out to be 15% higher if an iPhone 16 has enhanced AI capabilities. ""If we are correct, and new LLM-enabled software features drive an upgrade cycle, then we see the potential for up to 15% upside to our FY25 iPhone shipment forecast,"" wrote Woodring. The acronym ""LLM"" refers to ""large language models"" such as OpenAI's GPT-4. Woodring speculates that the world will see details at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference this summer, ""highlighted by an LLM-powered Siri 2.0 and a broader GenAI-enabled operating system that has the potential to catalyze an iPhone upgrade cycle.""  Why is ""LLM-powered"" such a big deal? To use large language models akin to OpenAI's GPT-4 requires a phone to go back and forth to the network, sending prompts and retrieving responses. Even on a desktop computer with an ethernet connection, the round-trip means waiting a while for a response. In a mobile device on a cellular network, relying on the cloud connection could result in one of those awkward moments where Siri seems brain-dead. Also: iPhone 15 review: I spent a month with Apple's base model and found it more 'Pro' than ever Instead, what's needed is to eliminate the cloud reliance and move more of the LLM processing locally, on the device. Apple already has what it calls the ""Neural Engine"" in the iPhone, a separate collection of circuits for running AI. However, the AI tasks performed by the Neural Engine -- tasks much less demanding than an LLM -- are likely to involve very carefully defined functions such as face recognition, where the use of the circuits has been carefully curated.  Taking an off-the-shelf large language model and running it locally is bound to be a much more demanding task.  Woodring bases much of his enthusiasm about this year's AI on a paper published this month by Apple researchers Keivan Alizadeh and colleagues, titled, ""LLM in a flash: Efficient large language model inference with limited memory,"" which is posted on the arXiv pre-print server. Also: Humane's aspiring smartphone-killer 'Ai Pin' may be the most 2023 product y...",1

‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ Returns to Theaters This Weekend,2024-01-24T18:00:01+00:00,https://www.thewrap.com/killers-of-the-flower-moon-theaters-release-oscars/,"Apple and Paramount are bringing Martin Scorsese’s epic back after its 10 Oscar nominations “Killers of the Flower Moon” is back. The film, which launched theatrically last fall and is currently streaming on Apple TV+ (and is also available digitally), just racked up 10 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director (Martin Scorsese), Best Actress (Lily Gladstone) and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro), will return to theaters starting this Friday, January 26. The release is once again in partnership with Paramount Pictures, with the film screening in more than 1,000 theaters globally. Based on David Grann’s best-selling nonfiction book and adapted by Scorsese and Eric Roth, “Killers of the Flower Moon” charts the Reign of Terror – a period of time when the Osage Nation was under attack after it was discovered that the land they were given by the government was rich with oil. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a man recruited by his uncle (De Niro) to marry an indigenous woman (Gladstone) in an attempt to gain her headrights. What makes the story more complicated is that he is actually in love with her. Jesse Plemmons plays the FBI agent sent to investigate the murders. “Killers of the Flower Moon” was also nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Production Design, Best Original Score, Best Original Song, Best Film Editing and Best Cinematography. If you didn’t see it on the big screen or were worried about its epic, 206-minute runtime, this is the time to watch “Killers of the Flower Moon.” It’s certainly benefits from the size of the screen and should be required viewing in the lead up to the Academy Awards in March.

"Hello, Apple has joined the AI arms race",2024-01-24T17:52:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3712600/hello-apple-has-joined-the-ai-arms-race.html#tk.rss_all,"
				Though Apple's actual plans around Generative AI will remain a closely guarded secret for some time...			  Forty years to the day since the first Macintosh appeared beside a youthful Steve Jobs and made the world swoon when the word “hello” appeared on its display, Apple is closer than ever to realizing the vision it had then. The Mac, with its GUI, mouse, and keyboard, launched an industry and spawned imitators (including Windows). The crowd at the Jobs-hosted launch event (which IDG/Computerworld founder Pat McGovern once told me included him, though he quipped he’d actually first seen the Macintosh the previous year) went crazy. We know what happened after that. The company saw insanely great success, deep failure, came close to collapse and then rose all over again. The human-centered principles inherent to the Mac user interface were later carried over to Apple’s mobile products such as its notebook, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and most recently, Vision Pro. The OS continued to improve, too, and that on-screen “Hello” became Siri — which is itself poised to rise again. Siri seems to have fallen behind rivals, something Apple doesn’t want to see. So, the company is making significant investment in artificial intelligence (AI) to put Siri on steroids. Citing Pitchbook data, a Financial Times report claims Apple has acquired 21 AI start-ups since the beginning of 2017 and seemingly confirms that one of the main aims of the research is to put AI on mobile devices, most likely with iOS 18 later this year. Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives expects more news, predicting Apple will make a sizeable acquisition in the space this year. “There’s an AI arms race going on, and Apple is not going to be on the outside looking in,” he told FT. Evidence Apple is accelerating its efforts continues to percolate. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring described Apple’s “Edge AI” opportunity in an extensive note to clients. “We believe Apple’s efforts to bring these features to market are accelerating, increasingly the likelihood of an “AI iPhone” launch as soon as Fall 2024,” he wrote. “For example, the mix of Apple job postings for Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing roles continue to increase, with Deep Learning appearing in 49% of Apple’s AI jobs postings, and NLP appearing in 23% of postings.” The scalp Apple seems to want is to create an on-device generative AI solution. Existing systems, even on mobile devices, rely on cloud-based AI, which drives up the cost per query. Apple seemingly hopes to exploit the Neural Engine on its powerful existing chips alongside its own innovations (including MLX and “Ferret”) to enable on-device intelligence at least partially. This, of course, extends to Siri and suggests that in the not-so-distant future, when you turn on your Mac, you’ll be greeted by a spoken “hello” from a computer that through a combination of GenAI LLM models and machine vision intelligence has something like automated consciousness. (Ferre...",2
"When Will ‘Masters Of The Air’ Season 1, Episode 1 Come Out?",2024-01-24T17:44:57+00:00,https://uproxx.com/tv/when-will-masters-of-the-air-season-1-episode-1-come-out/,"C’mon, you knew that Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks weren’t done with World War II yet. Following Band Of Brothers (2001) and The Pacific (2010) on HBO (and don’t forget Saving Private Ryan), the executive producing duo has shifted over to Apple TV+ for Masters Of The Air.  As the title suggests, this new series will be chock full of breathtaking and intense scenes of aerial combat, all with a side of Barry Keoghan, fresh from drinking bathwater (and doing stuff to a grave) in Saltburn. Hey, he’s Irish, and yes, his character enjoys pointing that out, but let’s get to viewing logistics. The series launches Friday, January 26, 2024 with two episodes, followed by weekly through March 15, 2024, only on Apple TV+. The show will not only impress original viewers of Spielberg and Hanks’ former collaborations, but expect the cast to reel in younger generations too. The deck is fully stacked with Austin Butler (as Major Gale “Buck” Clevin) and Keough (as Lt. Curtis Biddick) being the most recognizable names, but Nate Mann should be a breakout as Major Robert “Rosie” Rosenthal (yep, expect to see “Rosie’s Riveters” figure prominently). Those are only a few names from the vast ensemble, and directors include Cary Joji Fukunaga, Tim Van Patten, Dee Rees (Mudbound), and the team of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck.",2

			Trending:		 World War II was, indeed, hell — even in the air. You are reminded of this repeatedly in the stellar new Apple TV series “Masters of the Air,” as bomber crews in Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses — the men of the 100th Bomb Group, aka the “Bloody Hundredth” — are wounded or worse as the United States Air Force strives to gain dominance in the skies over its German counterpart, the Luftwaffe, as D-Day approaches.  Launching with two of its nine hourlong episodes this week, the series is the latest World War II-related project from producers Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. The director and star, respectively, of the acclaimed 1998 film “Saving Private Ryan” later helped bring to the small screen the highly regarded HBO series “Band of Brothers” (2001) and “The Pacific” (2010), all of which mined great drama from the conflict between the Allied and Axis power that dominated the first half of the 1940s. “Masters of the Air” does the same, largely under the guidance of John Orloff, who was nominated for an Emmy Award for writing an installment of “Band of Brothers” and who here is the writer or co-writer of every episode. The series is adapted from the 2006 nonfiction book of the same name by Donald L. Miller. “Masters of the Air” carries with it a beefy ensemble, which is anchored by stars Austin Butler (“Elvis”) and Callum Turner (“The Boys in the Boat”), who portray Major Gale “Buck” Cleveland and Major John “Bucky” Egan, respectively. Despite their nicknames, the officers have little in common but are the best of friends before each arrives — Bucky before Buck — at the Thorpe Abbotts base in the United Kingdom. “Why didn’t you tell me?” Buck asks Bucky after the completion of his first harrowing air assignment. “What?” Bucky responds. “You’ve been up — two missions,” Buck says. “You didn’t tell me it was like that.” “I didn’t know what to say,” Bucky says. “You’ve seen it now.” “I don’t know what I’ve seen.” Theirs is the most endearing of bromances. They care deeply about and worry for each other throughout the twists and turns that lie ahead for them in the air and on the ground. And the performances of the stoic Butler — producers wanted a “John Wayne type” for Buck, according to the show’s production notes — and the cool-and-cocky Turner — a “swashbuckling attitude” was the requisite for Bucky — are two big reasons “Masters of the Air” is so consistently engaging. (And, no, it’s not a coincidence Butler was cast after working with Hanks on filmmaker Baz Luhrmann’s aforementioned 2022 Elvis Presley biopic.) While the ensemble also boasts “Saltburn” star Barry Keoghan as another daring pilot, Lt. Curtis Biddick, it devotes more time to two other supporting characters: Major Harry “Cros” Crosby (Anthony Boyle) and Major Robert “Rosie” Rosenthal (Nate Mann). Cros, who also serves as the series’ narrator, is a navigator with one small problem: He gets prett...",1
"Jon Stewart’s coming back to The Daily Show, but only on Mondays",2024-01-24T17:44:14+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/24049212/on-stewart-daily-show-return-date,"By  Charles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years. Just months after Jon Stewart’s sudden departure from Apple TV Plus, the comedian is set to make his return to The Daily Show on Comedy Central. According to The Hollywood Reporter, The Daily Show’s yearlong search for a new host following Trevor Noah’s departure in 2022 has culminated in Stewart’s return this February. In a statement about the news, Showtime / MTV Entertainment Studios president Chris McCarthy described Stewart as “the voice of our generation,” whose political perspectives are going to be invaluable as we get deeper into the 2024 presidential election cycle. “In our age of staggering hypocrisy and performative politics, Jon is the perfect person to puncture the empty rhetoric and provide much-needed clarity with his brilliant wit,” McCarthy said. In the year during Comedy Central’s search for someone to replace Noah, multiple guest hosts sat in for brief stints at The Daily Show desk, and a somewhat similar structure’s going to remain in place going forward. While Stewart will host Monday broadcasts, the newsroom’s correspondents will head up the show for the rest of the week, and Stewart is said to be actively “shaping new talent” for the long-running show. Stewart’s return to Comedy Central comes in the wake of his previous news show being prematurely canceled by Apple — reportedly over Stewart’s desire to report on artificial intelligence and topics related to China. Even if The Daily Show hadn’t been building up hype about who the new host might be, bringing Stewart back is the kind of move that’s likely going to be a ratings boon.  And with Stewart once again being in a position to speak his mind a bit more freely, it’s going to be very interesting to see if he comments on the reports that the gig almost went to Hasan Minhaj. Stewart will be back on The Daily Show beginning February 12th.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Microsoft hits $3T market value for first time as it chases Apple,2024-01-24T17:36:09+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/01/24/business/microsoft-hits-3t-market-value-for-first-time-as-it-chases-apple/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Microsoft’s stock market value crossed the $3 trillion milestone for the first time on Wednesday, retaining its place as the world’s second most valuable company, just behind iPhone maker Apple. Microsoft and Apple shares have been vying for the top spot as the most capitalized stock on Wall Street since the start of the year, with the iPhone maker briefly losing its crown to the X-box owner earlier in January. Shares of Microsoft hit a record high of $405.63, up 1.7%, enabling it to breach the $3 trillion market capitalization level. But it later closed at $402.56, valuing Microsoft at $2.99 trillion, just below the threshold price of $403.65 that would have kept it above $3 trillion. Apple’s shares pared earlier gains and closed down 0.35% at $194.50, giving it a market value of $3 trillion, according to LSEG data. Backed by its investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Microsoft is widely seen as a frontrunner in the race for market dominance in the rollout of generative artificial intelligence  among other tech giants, including Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Oracle, and Facebook owner Meta Platforms. Using OpenAI’s technology, Microsoft has rolled out newer versions of its flagship productivity software products as well as its Bing search engine, which is expected to better compete with Google’s dominant search offering. Apple, on the other hand, is facing slowing demand for its iPhones, particularly in China – where the company is offering customers rare discounts to boost sales amid stiff competition from homegrown rivals such as Huawei Technologies. Wall Street’s run-up to record highs will be put to the test in the coming weeks as megacap US technology-related companies begin reporting results.",-1

Jon Stewart returns to 'The Daily Show' ahead of 2024 election on the heels of Apple TV canceling his 'Problem',2024-01-24T17:17:22+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/01/24/jon-stewart-returns-host-daily-show-apple-tv-election/,"Comedian Jon Stewart is rewinding the clock, returning to “The Daily Show” as a weekly host and executive producing through the 2024 U.S. elections cycle. Comedy Central on Wednesday said Stewart will host the topical TV show, the perch he ruled for 16 years starting in 1999, every Monday starting Feb. 12. A rotating line-up of show regulars are on tap for the rest of the week. “Jon Stewart is the voice of our generation, and we are honored to have him return to Comedy Central’s The Daily Show to help us all make sense of the insanity and division roiling the country as we enter the election season,” Chris McCarthy, president and CEO of Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios, said in a statement. “In our age of staggering hypocrisy and performative politics, Jon is the perfect person to puncture the empty rhetoric and provide much-needed clarity with his brilliant wit.” Over the years, “The Daily Show” — first hosted by Craig Kilborn, then Stewart and Trevor Noah — has skewered the left and right by making the media a character and playing it absolutely straight, no matter how ridiculous. The show, which won an Emmy Award this month for best talk series, has not had a permanent host since Noah left last year. The show’s long-term legacy as a talent incubator is sterling, becoming a launching pad for the likes of Aasif Mandvi, John Oliver, Larry Wilmore, Jordan Klepper and Samantha Bee. Stewart was awarded the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2022. Recently, Stewart’s “The Problem With Jon Stewart,” which debuted in 2021, was canceled on the Apple TV+ streaming service. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Apple TV+ shows coming back this year: all the details from Bad Sisters season 2 to Slow Horses season 4,2024-01-24T17:05:52+00:00,https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/511986/apple-tv-shows-coming-back-2024/,"Subscribe When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission. Read our full commerce guidelines here. Apple TV+ has some brilliant TV shows that we have become totally obsessed with over the years, and we’re so excited to see the return of some of these critically acclaimed hits this year. From Bad Sisters to Trying, here’s what’s back in 2024…  After perhaps the best season finale ever, we can’t wait to get more answers (and let’s face it, probably be offered up plenty of new mysteries) in Adam Scott’s deeply weird but addictive TV show about office workers who have a microchip in their brains which means they forget about their personal lives while working, and forget their work lives in reality - leading them to be two very different people. Bring it on.  WATCH APPLE TV+ HERE Slow Horses is one of telly’s most underrated shows - with the tale of MI5 agents at Slough House reaching its peak in season three. Here’s what the novel’s description has to say about what we might expect from season four. It read: “Retired from the intelligence service, David Cartwright still knows where the skeletons are hidden. But when he forgets that secrets are supposed to stay buried, there's suddenly a target on his back… Jackson Lamb worked with David back in the day. He knows better than most that this is no innocent old man. So when River's panic button raises the alarm at Intelligence Service HQ, Lamb will do whatever he thinks necessary to protect an agent in peril.” Now that Jason and Nikki have landed custody of their kids Princess and Tyler, the challenge is keeping their family together! With plenty more humour and drama, we can’t wait to see what comes next for our favourite television couple, their friends and parents, and their new little family.  Mythic quest, despite the name, is much less about the RPG fantasy game being made and much more about the dysfunctional work environment and the relationships between the talented but neurotic characters.  Season 3 left off with Ian (pronounced Iron) and Poppy returning to Mythic Quest following the previous seasons' walkout, reuniting with their anxiety-plagued former boss David. Meanwhile, Dana brings the evil and former frenemy pairing of Jo and Brad to start a new company. This hilarious stand-out is back for season 4 for a reason - so catch up now!  WATCH APPLE TV+ HERE Since season one - where the sisters went out of their way to kill their despised brother-in-law - was a pretty open-and-cut show, we’re curious to see where the story will go for this Irish drama’s second outing, but in Sharon Horgan we trust! The show’s creator and star will be back for round two alongside Anne Marie Duff, Eve Hewson and Daryl McCormack.  Speaking about what to expect in season two, Sharon told Radio Times: “I had no intention of doing any more, but while we were on set I kept thinking of this one idea that could be a possible second season.  “The first series did have a lovely end, but I think when ...",2
Apple Watch 9 Problems: 5 Things You Need to Know,2024-01-24T16:54:15+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/apple-watch-9-problems/,"Published on By Apple Watch 9 users have run into an assortment of problems. If you own an Apple Watch 9, or if you’re thinking about buying one, here’s what you need to know about these issues.  We haven’t heard about any widespread problems with the Apple Watch Series 9 though we have seen complaints about various bugs and performance issues. Some of these issues are minor while others are far more problematic. With that in mind, we want to run down everything you need to know about Apple Watch 9 problems. Table of Contents Our guide outlines the most common Apple Watch 9 problems, provides potential fixes for issues, highlight places to find feedback about the Apple Watch 9’s performance, and offers a look at what’s next in the watchOS 10 pipeline for the device. The list of Apple Watch 9 problems has grown since launch. Apple’s fixed some of the initial problems, but we’ll continue to see issues emerge as more people buy the device and as owners put more mileage on the watch. We’ve heard about problems that plague every single version of the Apple Watch. The current list of Apple Watch 9 problems includes the following: We’ll continue to update this list as we push away from Apple’s latest watchOS 10 software release. If you’re thinking about buying an Apple Watch 9, or if you already bought one, it’s important to keep tabs on feedback about the device’s performance. This feedback will alert you to potential problems with the device’s hardware and software. Fortunately, there are plenty of places to find feedback about the Apple Watch 9’s current performance.  We recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites, and the MacRumors forums for the latest information. We’ve published a quick watchOS 10.4 review that covers the software’s performance and we plan to release guides covering future watchOS 10 updates as well. If you run into an issue on your Apple Watch 9, your first instinct might be to contact Apple for help. However, you may be able to fix the problem(s) on your own in a matter of minutes. In many cases, restarting your Apple Watch and/or your iPhone will fix an issue. You might also want to try performing a hard reset as this can alleviate performance issues. If you’re having issues charging your Apple Watch 9, make sure the device is situated properly on the charger. You may also want to try a different cord and/or outlet to see if that helps. For more potential fixes, you should head on over to Apple’s discussion forums. If the users there can’t help you, you might want to get in contact with Apple via its website. If you still can’t fix your issue(s), schedule an appointment to see a Genius at your local Apple Store. They should be able to diagnose your issue(s) relatively quickly. This is a PSA for new Apple Watch users: You can move back to older software on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, but downgrading isn’t an option for the Apple Watch. In other words, once you install a new software update ...",-2
"Apple weighs taking commissions on sideloaded apps in EU, report says",2024-01-24T16:54:14+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/24/apple-weighs-taking-commissions-on-sideloaded-apps-in-eu-report-says/,"Apple is determined to take a slice of in-app purchases, no matter how users access apps or make their payments, it seems. After dropping commissions to 27% following a court ruling that said Apple had to allow app developers the ability to point to their own payment options via the web, the company is now floating the idea that it could take a similar course of action for apps that are downloaded outside its App Store. In the EU, Apple will be subject to a new law that will for the first time allow users to download apps to their devices without having to go through the App Store — a major change that will impact how iOS apps are discovered, marketed, and accessed. Apple has staunchly argued against such a measure, saying that it will expose iPhone users to numerous security risks, similar to Android, which already permits the practice. However, the EU legislation is meant to even the playing field between the tech giant and those that want to conduct business on its platform. According to a new report today from The Wall Street Journal, Apple plans to “introduce new fees and restrictions” for apps downloaded outside its App Store in the EU. In other words, it could still attempt to take a commission on in-app purchases and other sales, even if the app is discovered and installed from other websites, and not the App Store. This could present a challenge to the new legislation, which was meant to offer companies a way to do business without being subject to Apple’s commissions. Though the law will only apply in European markets, companies were already considering how to take advantage of the new possibilities ahead. Microsoft was considering establishing its own app store for mobile games. The WSJ said Meta was also considering a system where users could download apps from Facebook apps. Spotify, a notable Apple critic, was also planning to offer app downloads on its website, the report added. The WSJ cited “people familiar with the company’s plans” as its source, and noted the plans could still change, which likely means Apple is floating the news ahead of a formal announcement. (Apple has not yet responded to a request for comment.) Reading between the lines, it seems that Apple is considering how to put into action a similar set of guidelines as it did when complying with the ruling in the Epic antitrust case. Though Apple largely won that case, as the court declared that the company was not a monopolist, it lost on one claim where the court decided Apple couldn’t restrict app developers from pointing to their own websites where users could process payments. Apple did legally comply with the ruling, but with a lot of caveats. It has templates and language for developers to use, restrictions on what can’t be said, and restrictions on what sort of websites can be linked to. It also bars app video and news app developers already participating in other programs that reduce their commissions from adding links to outside payments in their apps. Epic...",-1

Apple ramping up plans to integrate AI into iPhones: report,2024-01-24T16:12:32+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/01/24/business/apple-ramping-up-plans-to-integrate-ai-into-iphones-report/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Apple has been steadily pouring resources into the pursuit of advanced intelligence products – and the tech giant is reportedly planning to integrate the features into future versions of its iPhones. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company has acquired a whopping 21 AI startups since 2017, the Financial Times reported, citing PitchBook data.  More transactions could be on the way. “They are getting ready to do some significant M&A,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives told the outlet. “I’d be shocked if they don’t do a sizable AI deal this year, because there’s an AI arms race going on, and Apple is not going to be on the outside looking in.” Additionally, Apple has stepped up efforts to hire employees with expertise in “deep learning” – a reference to models that power advanced AI systems.  Nearly half of all AI-related Apple job postings include the phrase, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a research note cited in the article. Insiders reportedly believe that Apple is looking for ways to add generative AI features that can run on iPhones and other portable devices Instead of through cloud computing networks. Morgan Stanley analysts predict that Apple could unveil key details as soon as its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, when the company is expected to detail generative AI features included in the new version of iOS, its mobile operating system.  The analysts said Apple’s voice assistant Siri could receive an AI-related upgrade. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company also has been “working on its own large language models” to compete with those offers by tech rivals such as OpenAI and Google, the FT reported, citing industry insiders. The outlet also pointed to Apple’s release of more powerful computing chips for hardware devices which appear to be geared toward the greater requirements for AI processing. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment. Needham analyst Laura Martin said AI developments would be crucial for Apple as it looks to “protect their installed base” of hardware devices, which still comprise the bulk of the company’s revenue. “Apple doesn’t want to be in the business of what Google and Amazon want to do, which is to be the backbone of all American businesses that build apps on large language models,” Martin told the FT. CEO Tim Cook referenced the company’s efforts during an earnings call last November, telling analysts that Apple was “investing quite a bit” into AI and was developing the technology “responsibly.” “In terms of generative AI, obviously, we have work going on,” Cook said last November. “I’m not going to get into details about what it is, because as you know, we really don’t do that. But you can bet we’re investing.” Last summer, Bloomberg reported that Apple had begun testing “Apple GPT” as part of its bid to catch up to other Big Tech rivals. Elsewhere, Apple has reportedly engaged in ne...",3

The Mac turns 40: How Apple's rebel PC almost failed again and again,2024-01-24T16:08:23+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-mac-turns-40-how-apples-rebel-pc-almost-failed-again-and-again/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular In 1984, we were listening to Prince's Purple Rain on FM radio; we were watching Ghostbusters at the drive-in movie theater; and, oh yes, we were falling in love with Apple's radical new computer, the Macintosh.  On January 24, 1984, the Mac was unveiled to the world. Priced at $2,495, or $7,366 in 2024 dollars, it featured a 9-inch black-and-white display, 128KB of RAM, a 400 KB floppy disk drive, and built-in networking. Its most revolutionary aspect was its graphical user interface (GUI) with its windows, icons, menu, and mouse-driven pointer (WIMP). This was a stark contrast to the command-line interfaces common at the time. Also: Watch Kevin Costner's very 80s Apple commercial Windows? It was a year away. Me? I was running CP/M, Xenix, and MS-DOS on PCs, and Sun Unix (soon to be SunOS), System III Unix, and 3BSD on minicomputers and workstations. But, thanks to Xerox PARC and Apple's own Mac precursor, Lisa, I already knew about GUIs, and I thought they'd be big.   I wasn't the only one. The Mac's story began not with Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, as you might think, but with Jef Raskin, an Apple employee, who envisioned an easy-to-use, affordable, less than $500 computer. Jobs had a very different vision. He wanted a full-featured computer no matter what the price tag. I think we all know who won that fight. By 1981, Jobs took over the project, infusing it with his vision of a computer for everyone. After a misfire with the expensive Apple Lisa -- Jobs was removed from the project -- Jobs devoted all his time and energy to the Mac. With his flair for the dramatic, Jobs had a young director, Ridley Scott, create what would become an iconic Mac Super Bowl 1984 commercial, portraying the Mac as a symbol of individuality and freedom. That vision of the Mac and Apple products as rebel products remains with us to this day. Also: The best and newest Macs compared I wasn't at its introduction at De Anza College in Cupertino, California, but several of my tech journalist friends were, and they told me that besides Jobs, other technology leaders, such as Bill Gates and Lotus founder Mitch Kapor were there and promised to make software for this new machine. They didn't keep that promise. But it wasn't their fault. The first Mac, also known as the Thin Mac, simply didn't have the resources needed to run much in the way of software. That didn't stop a few people from embracing the Mac, but it stalled independent software vendors (ISV) from making Mac software.  Despite a strong start, sales soon slowed. There was only so much you could do with MacWrite and MacPaint on a thin Mac. Sales improved with the introduction of the Mac 512, aka the Fat Mac, with its 512K of memory later in 1984. But, without a hard drive, it still had a very limited audience. This led to internal fights in Apple and Jobs's departure from Apple in 1985.

Apple thought it dealt with Epic v. Apple — has it really?,2024-01-24T16:00:00+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/24049014/apple-epic-court-ruling-developer-tax,"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Almost three years after the Epic v. Apple trial reached its conclusion, Apple is finally following a court order to let app developers link to outside payment methods. But its solution is being met with backlash. Apple is giving developers the green light to send app users outside the built-in iOS payment system for the first time, following the instructions of a California court ruling in 2021. Under the terms of the injunction, Apple can’t prevent developers from including links, buttons, and other calls to action that direct users to outside payment methods. In a filing outlining the changes, Apple says it has “fully complied” with the order — but has it really? While the new system technically lets developers avoid Apple’s fees of up to 30 percent for in-app purchases, it’s a hollow victory. The new policy will see Apple charge up to 27 percent as a commission on each purchase. On top of that, Apple’s compliance plan introduces other hindrances to developers that might deter users from making purchases on an external site. It’s a move that Epic CEO Tim Sweeney has called “bad-faith” compliance, promising legal action in response.  The injunction doesn’t say Apple can’t take a commission from purchases made on external websites, and Apple is taking full advantage of that. (Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also mentioned the possibility of Apple taking a commission in one footnote of her ruling.) Last week’s compliance order states Apple will apply the 27 percent commission for transactions that “take place on a developer’s website within seven days after a user taps through an External Purchase Link.” Apple carves out a couple of exceptions: the company will charge the members of its Small Business Program at a discounted 12 percent rate, while transactions that automatically renew will also incur a 12 percent fee in the second year or later. Apple is going to “poison the one victory Epic secured in their lawsuit so bad nobody would ever think to use it.” That 27 percent charge is lower than the 30 percent commission Apple takes through App Store transactions, and the 12 percent rate is lower than the normal 15 percent Small Business Program commission. But developers will have to use a third-party payment processor, which typically requires its own roughly 3 percent fee — so they’re likely not saving any money. Meanwhile, the process creates additional burdens. Users must tap through a new warning screen every time they select an external payment link, saying Apple isn’t responsible for “the privacy or security of purchases made on the web,” and that they won’t be able to “access their App Store account, stored payment methods, or manage refund requests through the website.” Apple also won’t allow links on any page that’s part of “an in-app flow to merchandise” and payments must link out...",-2
iOS 18 Update: Everything You Need to Know,2024-01-24T15:46:38+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/ios-18-release-date-rumors-beta-info/,"Published on By If you’re curious about the next version of iOS, we’ll take you through everything you need to know right now about Apple’s upcoming iOS 18 update for iPhone.  iOS 18 rumors have already outlined potential upgrades coming to the iPhone later this year. Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman says internally, iOS 18 is viewed as one of the biggest, if not the biggest, iOS updates in the company’s history. Armed with that information, and years of experience covering Apple’s software, we can put together an early look at what to expect from iOS 18 and its release. Table of Contents If you’ve owned an iPhone for a long time, you may know some of this already. If you haven’t, or you’re simply looking to set proper expectations, here’s what you need to know right now. Perhaps the biggest question on everyone’s mind is this one: Which iPhones will get iOS 18? Here’s what we can tell you. Apple won’t confirm a full list of iOS 18 eligible iPhone models until WWDC 24 in June, but you can expect most, if not all, iOS 17-powered devices to get the upgrade. There are, however, a few iPhone models that could potentially be on the chopping block. iPhones typically get software upgrades for five or six years before they get left behind. For instance, the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus, all of which launched in 2017 with iOS 11 on board, are stuck on iOS 16. They didn’t get upgraded to iOS 17. That being said, they will continue to get new upgrades with security patches throughout 2024.  If Apple sticks to this protocol in 2024, the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR, which launched a year after the iPhone X and iPhone 8, may get stuck on iOS 17. Again, we won’t know for sure until June. A rumor suggests all iOS 17-powered iPhone models will make the move to iOS 18 in the fall. This source has a proven track record which means iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR owners can breathe a sigh of relief. For now. Below is a list of iPhones that should get upgraded to iOS 18. Given their age, none of these phones are in danger of missing the upgrade. iOS 18 Eligible iPhone Models We’ll add the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR to the list if we see other reports corroborate the information. Speaking of WWDC, that’s when you can expect Apple to confirm iOS 18 for the first time. WWDC 24 kicks off on June 10th this year.  Apple typically pushes the first version of an iOS operating system’s beta to developers on the first day of WWDC. In other words, you can expect the first iOS 18 beta to roll out on June 10th. Unless Apple changes things up, there will be two versions of the iOS 18 beta: A developer beta and a public beta for users registered for the Beta Software Program. The developer beta usually arrives a few weeks before the public beta. In the past, Apple’s launched public betas in July so that’s what you should expect at this point. The iOS 18 beta will stretch over several months. We can’t predict how many versions of the beta we’l...",2
Mac at 40: Apple celebrates birthday of the computer that helped make it the world’s biggest company,2024-01-24T15:32:01+00:00,https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/mac-at-40-apple-celebrates-birthday-of-the-computer-that-helped-make-it-the-world-s-biggest-company-b2484101.html,"Notifications can be managed in browser preferences. Please refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged inPlease refresh your browser to be logged in From beige to bright colours to sleek aluminium, the Mac has changed dramatically over the decades – but defied those who predicted its demise  Find your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profile Apple is celebrating the 40th birthday of arguably the first product that began its rise to the biggest public company in the world: the Macintosh. In the 40 years since, the Mac has been entirely redesigned, as well as losing the latter two syllables of its name. What began as a beige, sharp box has since been redesigned in various forms including the laptop, and it has been at the heart of ideas about the future of computing. But throughout the decades it has remained at the heart of Apple as it has grown. And even as it has been eclipsed by Apple’s other products – such as the iPhone and now the Vision Pro – its legacy lives on, in those products themselves. As with so many of Apple’s products, the Mac wasn’t really the first to do anything in particular. There had been PCs before; it wasn’t even Apple’s first attempt, and had followed other similar but more expensive products such as the Apple II and Lisa. And similar to other Apple products that would come later, it wasn’t necessarily clear at the beginning that it would go on to be such a success. At its launch, 40 years ago today, it was hailed as a breakthrough but nonetheless criticised for its lack of speed and other problems. The Macintosh would go on to become the first major personal computer of its kind, however, popularising technology such as the graphical user interface. It sold well, and so did the products that followed, as the Mac was updated and gradually went from being a boxy beige cube to the colourful and rounded iMac and the portable power of the MacBook. The date of the first Mac’s release – 24 January, 1984, was famous in part because it was included in one of the most famous ads ever. During the Super Bowl, two days earlier, Apple had run a 1984-themed ad that established the idea of the Mac as creative and counter-cultural – something still reflected in Apple’s marketing to this day. “On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh,” the Ridley Scott-directed ad concludes. “And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like 1984.” That ad has since gone on to be celebrated and occasionally mocked. When Fortnite developer Epic Games began its campaign against Apple’s 30 per cent cut on purchases through the App Store, for instance, it mocked up a new version of the ad that suggested Apple had gone from being a counter-cultural pioneer to the exact powerful corporation it had once criticised. Apple had certainly become far richer and more powerful than it was when the Mac launched. It sold tens of thousands of the original Macintosh in its first year; now, it sells million...",0

How to collaborate on a playlist in Apple Music,2024-01-24T15:14:23+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/how-to/how-to-collaborate-on-a-playlist-in-apple-music-4410216,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience. If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. Allowing your mates to collaborate on Apple Music playlists you have crafted has long been a feature many users of the service have been calling for, with iOS 17.3 and an update to the Music app it has become a reality. Here’s how to get it going. This new collaborative feature in Apple Music allows anyone with a link or a scan of a QR code to add and tweak a playlist by adding or removing songs and using emojis to react to specific songs. It’s a neat feature and something that’s been missing from the Spotify rival for a while now. If you want to start with collaborative playlists on Apple Music, we’ve outlined the steps below. To begin, open up the Apple Music app on your iOS device running iOS 17.3. You will need to be subscribed to Apple Music for this to function. Once you’ve opened Apple Music, tap the Library icon in the bottom row. Next, tap the Playlist option. You can see the icon in the image attached to this step. Now, you’ll want to choose a playlist you want to share and allow others to collaborate on. This can either be an existing playlist you’ve created or one you’ve created specifically to share.  Once you’ve found the perfect playlist tap the collaborate icon in the top right corner. The icon looks like a person with a ‘+’ sign next to it and is positioned next to the download icon. You’ll now get a pop-up menu that lets you copy a link to the playlist that can be shared with others, a QR code generator and the ability to choose between allowing anyone to access it or only approved people. Send the link to whoever you want and collaborate. No, this only works on playlists you’ve created yourself. 
                                                                                    Max is the Editor of Trusted Reviews, and has been a mobile phone and technology specialist for over nine years. Max started his career at T3 straight after graduating from Kingston University.

"Apple’s iOS 17.3 release includes added theft protection, other features",2024-01-24T15:09:41+00:00,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/1/24/24048652/apple-iphone-update-ios-stolen-device-protection-features,"Apple iPhones are displayed at the Apple store in Chicago.  Scott Olson/Getty Apple released iOS 17.3 Monday, marking the third update to the software since its debut in September. The update adds security and Apple Music features that have been in beta testing since December. A key feature is “stolen device protection,” which provides a layer of security for accounts linked to a device. The software can be updated on compatible iPhones and iPads by going to Settings, tapping the General icon and choosing the software update menu, where you can update immediately or overnight.  The tentpole feature of the latest update is stolen device protection. Once your iOS 17.3 update is complete, you can go back into Settings, select Face ID & Passcode and turn on the Stolen Device Protection option. The feature, which beta users have to opt into, will require the person to either use Touch ID or Face ID to access sensitive information, such as iCloud keychain passwords and Apple Card access when away from home, work or places where you often use your iPhone.  It also implements a one-hour delay in addition to two biometric scans to access settings, if there’s an attempt to change your Apple ID password or passcode when your phone is at an unfamiliar location. The security delay allows a user time to “mark their device as lost and make sure your Apple account is secure,” according to Apple.  The Wall Street Journal reported last year on a rise in iPhone thefts where perpetrators spied on victim’s phones, acquiring the passcode to access sensitive portions of the phone, lock victims out of the Apple ecosystem and gain access to bank and email accounts. “In the rare cases where a thief can observe the user entering the passcode and then steal the device, stolen device protection adds a sophisticated new layer of protection,” Apple stated when the iOS 17.3 beta was released. The update also allows users to collaborate on playlists with other Apple Music users and invite friends to add songs and emojis on playlists. The feature originally debuted on the beta for iOS 17.2 but was not included in the official release, according to 9to5 Mac. IOS 17.3 includes a “Unity” wallpaper option that celebrates Black History Month. The update allows users to stream media from an iPhone to televisions in select hotels. Updated devices will display a user’s AppleCare and warranty information for devices linked to an Apple ID. The company announced that there are improvements for crash detection in all iPhone 14 and 15 models. Contributing: Subrina Hudson © 2024 Chicago Sun-Times Media, Inc.",2

     An iPhone has a built-in feature called accessibility assistant. What would happen if your iPhone fell into the wrong hands? Have you ever worried about that? Well, worry no more, because Apple just rolled out a new software update that makes your phone more secure than ever. The now available iOS 17.3 update comes with a feature called Stolen Device Protection, which locks down your phone with your biometric verification. This means that it prevents a crook from accessing or changing certain settings on your phone without your Face ID or Touch ID.  Stolen Device Protection can be a lifesaver if your iPhone gets lost or stolen, as it gives you more time to track it down or wipe it clean. It also stops a thief from using your saved passwords, credit cards, or Apple Cash to buy stuff or send money. With Stolen Device Protection, you can rest assured that your iPhone is safe and secure, even if it’s not in your hands. CLICK TO GET KURT’S FREE CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH SECURITY ALERTS, QUICK VIDEO TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, AND EASY HOW-TO’S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER  Stolen Device Protection feature on iPhone (Kurt ""Cyberguy"" Knutsson) Stolen Device Protection enhances the security of your iPhone by requiring Face ID or Touch ID for certain actions, even if you have a passcode set up. Normally, if Face ID or Touch ID fails, you can enter your passcode to unlock your phone or perform other tasks. But with Stolen Device Protection, some actions will only accept your face or fingerprint, and others will have a security delay of one hour before you can use your passcode. This means that if someone steals your iPhone and tries to access your sensitive data or change your settings, they won’t be able to do so without your biometric verification. And if they try to guess your passcode, they’ll have to wait an hour before they can try again. Stolen Device Protection applies to the following eight actions on your iPhone: SCAMS ARE THE POLICY PROBLEM NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT 1) Use payment methods saved in Safari (autofill) 2) Turn off Lost Mode 3) Use passwords or passkeys saved in Keychain 4) Erase all content and settings 5) Apply for a new Apple Card 6) Use your iPhone to set up a new device (for example, Quick Start) 7) Take certain Apple Cash and Savings actions in Wallet (for example, Apple Cash or Savings transfers) 8) View Apple Card virtual card number With Stolen Device Protection, you might have to wait for an hour before you can modify important security settings or your Apple ID.

"ForeFlight Announces Voyager, An Intriguing App For Apple Vision Pro",2024-02-01T23:52:42+00:00,https://s30121.pcdn.co/aviation-news/foreflight-announces-voyager-an-intriguing-app-for-apple-vision-pro/,"ForeFlight announced today (Feb. 1) it has designed Voyager, an advanced 3D airport application developed exclusively for Apple’s $3,499 Vision Pro virtual reality goggle platform. Targeting what ForeFlight refers to as aviation enthusiasts, Voyager “combines satellite imagery, high-resolution terrain and live traffic data to bring each airport to life in 3D on top of a floating disk that users can view from any angle.” Company CEO Tim Schuetze said, “ForeFlight is excited to deliver this unique 3D airport exploration experience to aviation enthusiasts with Apple Vision Pro. This exciting new spatial computing platform enables us to deliver all-new experiences that were never before possible, and the new Voyager app is a great example of our continued innovation.” While Vision Pro is priced $3,000 higher than established virtual reality goggle competitor Quest 3, it offers significantly higher resolution for its imaging. Initially targeting professional applications as well as recreational markets, Vision Pro also has high-resolution outward-looking cameras that can present a real-time, real-world view of the environment surrounding the user. That view can be combined with the selected image in a hybrid display of the game or other environment. ForeFlight’s Voyager application includes connectivity with live traffic feeds for selected airports, enabling “aviation enthusiasts” to view actual real-time aircraft, their altitudes and heading information along with high-resolution images of the airport environment and surrounding terrain. Could reference to ForeFlight’s “continued innovation” suggest the possibility that today’s virtual “floating disks” might someday be replaced by in-flight advanced “head-up” capabilities in low visibility? Asked to comment on the possibilities of in-flight applications of the Voyager technology, a ForeFlight spokesperson responded, “We’re excited about the potential future applications of the Vision Pro but can only speak to the app our team has created. While ForeFlight Mobile is designed to be used for preflight planning and inflight situational awareness, Voyager was created for aviation enthusiasts to immerse themselves in aviation in a fun and exciting new way.” Might help Apple sell Vision Pro! I had to look up what an Apple Vision Pro was as the whole article wasn’t making sense. Intriguing.   Reviews of the headset appear to be positive but initially I didn’t see much utility for me personally especially at that price point. This opens up a possible use as I fly out of a very busy uncontrolled airport with a ton of student pilots.  While ADS-B as well as keeping my head on a swivel works this might offer even greater situation awareness. Cost of $3,000-$3,500 along with the inevitable ForeFlight $ upsell versus a mid-air kinda makes it worth at least exploring using this. Interesting tech, I don’t see the value even in a high traffic area, I can argue it would be a distraction when you should be looking outs...",2

"Amazon, Meta and Apple beat revenue expectation, see shares jump",2024-02-01T23:42:57+00:00,https://globalnews.ca/news/10267264/apple-meta-amazon-earnings-revenue/,"Instructions: Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first. 
				If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.			 Amazon.com beat fourth-quarter revenue expectations on Thursday as new generative AI features in its cloud and ecommerce businesses spurred robust growth during the critical holiday period, sending its shares up eight per cent after the market close. The company forecast current-quarter revenue of $138 billion to $143.5 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG expect $142.13 billion. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the world’s largest cloud services provider, posted revenue of $24.2 billion in the fourth quarter, largely in line with analysts’ expectations of $24.26 billion. AWS CEO Andy Jassy in a statement touted the unit’s “continued long-term focus on customers and feature delivery,” citing efforts to incorporate generative AI into many of its services. The new features “are starting to be reflected in our overall results,” he said. Amazon’s roster of high-spending business customers have provided it stable growth in an uncertain economy, but its position as the world’s biggest cloud provider is being challenged by Microsoft and Alphabet . To bolster its cloud business and in response to Microsoft’s promised $10 billion investment in ChatGPT parent OpenAI, Amazon is spending up to $4 billion in chatbot-maker Anthropic. Earlier this week, Microsoft and Alphabet reported generous cloud revenue gains in the December quarter, beating Wall Street estimates, as customers lined up to test new AI features and build their own AI services. But mounting costs of developing these cutting-edge features irked investors hoping for a big sales boost from the new technology, sending their shares down. “All eyes will be on AWS, where the mild acceleration of growth … leaves some lingering doubts about whether the cloud unit will be able to hold its own against rivals,” said Insider Intelligence senior analyst Sky Canaves. Amazon shares have climbed over six per cent this year and 41 per cent in the past 12 months. The stock, which surged 81 per cent in 2023, helped boost the S&P 500 .SPX by nearly a quarter last year along with other tech giants. Despite the strong performance, Amazon began the year by shedding jobs in several divisions. Last year, it cut more than 27,000 jobs after hiring heavily during the pandemic like other tech rivals. “We’re coming off a period where we’ve done a lot of hiring,” Amazon’s Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a call. “There’s a general feeling in most teams that we’re trying to hold the line on headcount.” Amazon has built fulfillment centers closer to customers, making it cheaper and faster to deliver packages. During the key Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping events last year, customers worldwide bought more than 1 billion items on Amazon. The company has also launched Buy With Prime, a service that enables...",0
Tim Cook confirms Apple’s generative AI features are coming ‘later this year’,2024-02-01T23:20:50+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24058647/apple-ceo-tim-cook-teases-generative-ai-iphone,"By  Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater. Since 2011, he has published nearly 6,000 articles, from breaking news and reviews to useful how-tos. During Apple’s quarterly earnings call on Thursday afternoon, CEO Tim Cook mentioned that the company is working on generative AI software features that will make their way to customers “later this year.” That aligns with reporting from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who said recently that iOS 18 could be the “biggest” update in the operating system’s history. Cook’s teases — he mentioned generative AI several times, but never got specific — seem to confirm that we’re in for a big release this fall. “As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence, where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we’re excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year,” Cook said in his prepared remarks.  Analysts tried to press Cook for more details, but he didn’t offer much. “Our M.O., if you will, has always been to to do work and then talk about work, and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so we’re going to hold that to this as well. But we have got some things that we’re incredibly excited about, that we’ll be talking about later this year.” AI software features ranging from advanced photo manipulation to word processing enhancements have been a major selling point of smartphones from Google and Samsung in recent months. It’s rare for Apple to telegraph its upcoming moves, so you can take this as a sign that the company has ambitious plans to integrate AI into its software platforms — iOS, iPadOS, and macOS — later this year.  “Let me just say that I think there’s a huge opportunity for Apple with generative AI and with AI, without getting into many more details or getting out ahead of myself,” Cook said to conclude the call.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Apple Still Spinning Its Wheels,2024-02-01T23:20:42+00:00,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4666920-apple-still-spinning-its-wheels?source=feed_all_articles,,No rating found
"Apple sales boost profits, but China struggles continue",2024-02-01T23:06:11+00:00,https://kesq.com/money/cnn-business-consumer/2024/02/01/apple-ends-four-straight-quarters-of-losses-reporting-year-over-year-boost/," By Riley Gutiérrez McDermid and Samantha Delouya, CNN (CNN) — Apple has finally ended its losing streak. The company reported its first sales growth in a year on Thursday, boosted in particular by record revenue from its App Store and other services. But it’s still encountering difficulty in China. The earnings report comes one day before the company launches its biggest new product in years, the Vision Pro headset, which the company hopes to make the next must-have piece of home electronics. Overall, Apple posted its first increase in revenue in a year, but China was a weak spot: Revenue in the region slid 13% from last year. In contrast, sales increased in Europe and Japan. The company’s earnings come just one day before Apple begins selling one of its riskiest new hardware releases in recent years: An augmented reality headset, the Vision Pro. Over the past five years, Apple has spent an estimated $100 billion in research and development on the device, which will cost $3,499 in the US, according to a recent analysis. In a statement, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company’s growth was fueled by iPhone sales and an all-time revenue record in the company’s services division in the last three months of 2023. “We are pleased to announce that our installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments,” Cook said. Net iPhone sales grew from $65.7 billion one year ago to $69.7 billion in the last three months of 2023, but Jesse Cohen, a senior analyst at Investing.com, said that China’s revenue numbers indicate demand for the device in the region is slowing “more than expected in the face of rising competition from local companies, including Huawei.” “The big question is if this is just a blip, or signs of a bigger shift among consumers as rising interest rates and a weaker economic backdrop discourage consumers from making pricey purchases,” Cohen said. Cook addressed concerns about falling sales in China, saying, “I remain very optimistic about China over the long term.” Overall, Apple reported earnings per share of $2.18 for the quarter, a record for EPS for the company and higher than the $2.11 analysts had predicted. Revenue also beat analysts’ expectations for the quarter at $119.6 billion. Despite beating expectations on both the top and bottom lines, Apple’s stock dropped more than 3% after the market close. The debut of the Vision Pro dominated much of a question session with analysts and executives Thursday. “This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple,” Cook said of the Vision Pro. “It really took a whole company effort to bring it this far.” Correction: A previous version of the story misstated Apple’s past profits.

"Meta reveals dividend plans, Apple slumps in China, Amazon soars as tech earnings hit",2024-02-01T23:03:15+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/01/business/meta-reveals-dividend-plans-apple-slumps-in-china-amazon-soars-as-tech-earnings-hit/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Meta announced plans for its first-ever dividend and Amazon posted strong earnings, while Apple reported a sales slowdown in its key China market as three of the biggest tech stocks reported quarterly earnings on Thursday. The Big Tech behemoths, three of the so-called “Magnificent Seven,” have driven a market resurgence – though optimism has cooled in recent days as layoffs hammered the sector. Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta reported better-than-expected earnings, sending shares soaring more than 14% in after-hours trading – and boosting its market capitalization by a whopping $130 billion. The Facebook and Instagram parent said the dividend would be 50 cents per share of common stock, with payouts to be dispersed on March 26. The company also announced $50 billion in share buybacks. “We intend to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis going forward, subject to market conditions and approval by our board of directors,” the company said in a statement. The announcement was a positive development for Meta shareholders just one day after Zuckerberg was thrashed by Senate lawmakers on Capitol Hill over the company’s failure to protect kids from online sexual exploitation and abuse. Meta reported fourth-quarter earnings of $5.33 per share. Revenue jumped 25% to $40.1 billion. Both figures exceeded projections, according to LSEG data. “We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. “We’ve made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.”  The social media firm said it expects sales of up to $37 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2024, which was also higher than analysts expected. Apple’s results were a mixed bag. The company’s stock sank less than 2% in post-market trading as investors digested signs of a widening slump in China. Apple’s sales in the region plunged by 13% to $20.8 billion in the first quarter – lower than the $23.5 billion expected by analysts and the smallest figure since 2020, according to Bloomberg data. On the positive side, the company snapped a streak of four-straight sales declines, as revenue rose 2% to $119.58 billion in its all-important holiday sales quarter. Earnings jumped 16% to $2.18 per share. Sales of iPhones were also stronger than expected despite multiple warnings from analysts about potential weakness. “Today Apple is reporting revenue growth for the December quarter fueled by iPhone sales, and an all-time revenue record in Services,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. Cook also highlighted the upcoming release of Apple’s Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday as a sign the company was “committed as ever to the pursuit of groundbreaking innovation.” Elsewhere, Amazon shares popped by more than 9% as the ecommerce giant beat Wall Street’s expectations. The company’s quarterly sales jumped 14% to $170 billion. ...",-2
Apple Vision Pro: Day Two,2024-02-01T22:51:49+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/apple-vision-pro-day-two/,"Last night, I fell asleep under the stars, the chirp of crickets intermingling with the old radiator’s whistle off in the distance. I just finished an episode of Justified: City Primeval on the big screen. It was a constant 68 degrees, but I tucked myself into the duvet, nonetheless. For tonight, I’m thinking the surface of the moon, or perhaps the edge of a Hawaiian volcano. According to most analytics, the average American spends around seven hours a day in front of screens. The Center for Disease Control recommends something in the neighborhood of two hours. But for all the increased focus on sleep hygiene and the harmful effects of staring at displays all day, it seems society is swiftly moving in the opposite direction. When we refer to “screen time,” we’re largely talking about phones, computers, televisions — that sort of thing. All the while, an entirely distinct paradigm has been looming over the horizon for some years. In the case of the Vision Pro, we’re talking two screens — one per eye — with a combined 23 million pixels. These screens are, of course, significantly smaller than the other examples, but they’re right there in front of your eyes, like a $3,500 pair of glasses. This is something I’ve been thinking about quite a bit over my first 48 hours with the Vision Pro. In 2018, Apple introduced Screen Time as part of iOS 12. The feature is designed to alert users to their — and their children’s — device usage. The thinking goes that when presented with such stark figures at the end of each week, people will begin to rethink the way they interface with the world around them. Tomorrow, Apple is finally releasing the Vision Pro. The device is another effort to get people to rethink the way they interact with the world, albeit in entirely the opposite direction. Image Credits: Cory Green/Yahoo Image Credits: Cory Green/Yahoo I’ve spent much of the past two years attempting to break myself of some of my worse pandemic habits. Toward the top of the list are all those nights I fell asleep watching some bad horror movie on my iPad. I’ve been better about this. I’m reading more and embracing the silence. That is, until this week. The moment the Vision Pro arrived, all that went out the window. Now, there’s a certain extent to which much of this can be written off as part of my testing process. To review a product, you need to live with it as much as possible. In the case of the Vision Pro, that means living my life through the product as much as possible. I’m taking work calls on it, and using it to send emails and Slack messages. I’m listening to music through the audio pods and — as mentioned up top — using it to watch my stories. Even my morning meditation practice has moved over to the headset. It’s that classic irony of using technology to help counteract some of the problems it introduced into our lives in the first place. While my job requires me to use the Vision Pro as much as humanly possible while I have it, I have to assume my e...",2
Mark Zuckerberg calls Apple’s DMA rules ‘so onerous’ he doubts any developer will opt in,2024-02-01T22:50:14+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/mark-zuckerberg-calls-apples-dma-rules-so-onerous-he-doubts-any-developer-will-opt-in/,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has added his voice to those criticizing Apple’s compliance with the EU’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA) regulation, which forces Apple to open up its App Store and allow developers to use their own payment systems, among other things. During Meta’s Q4 earnings call this afternoon, Zuckerberg responded to an investor question asking for Meta’s thoughts on the DMA by saying Apple’s new rules were “so onerous” that he would be surprised if any developer adopted them. The new regulations were meant to increase competition in the app economy by allowing other companies to run their own app stores and collect their own payments, which would, in theory, allow them to bypass Apple’s commissions and fees. But Apple’s compliance with the DMA reduced commissions but added other, new fees — including a new “Core Technology Fee” — that would apply to any developer who adopted the DMA rules, regardless of where their app was distributed, including on the App Store. Otherwise, Apple said developers could choose to remain on the same commission structure that exists today, where Apple takes a 15% to 30% cut of in-app purchase revenues, depending on the app’s reach and other factors. Had the DMA been written to be more airtight, Meta could have used the new law to launch its own app store. It had once toyed with the idea of offering a Facebook Games store, for example, but Apple’s rules forced Facebook to remove any actual gameplay functionality in the app. Meta eventually gave up, shutting down the app in 2022, two years after its launch. From Zuckerberg’s comments today, it doesn’t look like Meta has any intention of bringing it back. “I don’t think that the Apple thing is going to have any difference for us because I think that the way that they’ve implemented it, I would be very surprised if any developer chose to go into the alternative app stores that they have,” Zuckerberg told investors. “They’ve made it so onerous, and I think, so at odds with the intent of what the EU regulation was that I think it’s just going to be very difficult for anyone — including ourselves — to really seriously entertain what they’re doing there.” Meta joins other tech companies that have criticized Apple’s compliance with the DMA, including Epic Games, Spotify, Mozilla and Microsoft. Epic Games, which sued Apple over antitrust issues and largely lost, called Apple’s DMA rules “malicious compliance” and full of “junk fees.” Spotify dubbed them “extortion” and a “total farce,” and Microsoft said they were a “step in the wrong direction.” Another notable Apple critic, Match, said it hadn’t yet decided if it will opt into the new DMA rules, as it’s still examining them. Apple’s answer to EU’s gatekeeper rules is new ‘core tech’ fee for apps  Spotify calls Apple’s DMA compliance plan ‘extortion’ and a ‘complete and total farce’  Epic Games CEO calls out Apple’s DMA rules as ‘malicious compliance’ and full of ‘junk fees’ ",-2
iOS 18 Update: Everything You Need to Know,2024-02-01T22:41:38+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/ios-18-release-date-rumors-beta-info/,"Published on By If you’re curious about the next version of iOS, we’ll take you through everything you need to know right now about Apple’s upcoming iOS 18 update for iPhone.  iOS 18 rumors have already outlined potential upgrades coming to the iPhone later this year. Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman says internally, iOS 18 is viewed as one of the biggest, if not the biggest, iOS updates in the company’s history. Armed with that information, and years of experience covering Apple’s software, we can put together an early look at what to expect from iOS 18 and its release. Table of Contents If you’ve owned an iPhone for a long time, you may know some of this already. If you haven’t, or you’re simply looking to set proper expectations, here’s what you need to know right now. Perhaps the biggest question on everyone’s mind is this one: Which iPhones will get iOS 18? Here’s what we can tell you. Apple won’t confirm a full list of iOS 18 eligible iPhone models until WWDC 24 in June, but you can expect most, if not all, iOS 17-powered devices to get the upgrade. There are, however, a few iPhone models that could potentially be on the chopping block. iPhones typically get software upgrades for five or six years before they get left behind. For instance, the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus, all of which launched in 2017 with iOS 11 on board, are stuck on iOS 16. They didn’t get upgraded to iOS 17. That being said, they will continue to get new upgrades with security patches throughout 2024.  If Apple sticks to this protocol in 2024, the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR, which launched a year after the iPhone X and iPhone 8, may get stuck on iOS 17. Again, we won’t know for sure until June. A rumor suggests all iOS 17-powered iPhone models will make the move to iOS 18 in the fall. This source has a proven track record which means iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR owners can breathe a sigh of relief. For now. Below is a list of iPhones that should get upgraded to iOS 18. Given their age, none of these phones are in danger of missing the upgrade. iOS 18 Eligible iPhone Models We’ll add the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR to the list if we see other reports corroborate the information. Speaking of WWDC, that’s when you can expect Apple to confirm iOS 18 for the first time. WWDC 24 kicks off on June 10th this year.  Apple typically pushes the first version of an iOS operating system’s beta to developers on the first day of WWDC. In other words, you can expect the first iOS 18 beta to roll out on June 10th. Unless Apple changes things up, there will be two versions of the iOS 18 beta: A developer beta and a public beta for users registered for the Beta Software Program. The developer beta usually arrives a few weeks before the public beta. In the past, Apple’s launched public betas in July so that’s what you should expect at this point. The iOS 18 beta will stretch over several months. We can’t predict how many versions of the beta we’l...",3
Apple set to unveil ‘revolutionary’ 20-ounce Vision Pro headset described as ‘face-hugging alien’,2024-02-01T22:40:34+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/01/tech/apple-set-to-unveil-revolutionary-vision-pro-headset-likened-to-tech-fentanyl/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Apple is set to unveil its new Vision Pro headset hailed as “revolutionary” by James Cameron and Marvel director Jon Favreau — while others have likened the clunky device to “digital fentanyl” and a “face-hugging alien.”  Tim Cook and his virtual reality team are gearing up for the Friday launch of its groundbreaking $3,500 device, which weighs about the same as five sticks of butter and earned accolades for its futuristic abilities by Cameron, the virtual reality pioneer and “Titanic” filmmaker.  “I would say my experience was religious,” Cameron, who has been working in VR for 18 years, told Vanity Fair. “I don’t bow down before the great god of Apple, but I was really, really blown away.”   But not everyone was as star-struck as Cameron, with some Silicon Valley investors hoping the hefty product — both in weight and price — would sink under its own ambition.  “I’m sure the technology is terrific. I still think and hope it fails,” a Silicon Valley investor, who was not identified, told the magazine. “Apple feels more and more like a tech fentanyl dealer that poses as a rehab provider.” The device weighs about 20 ounces and once strapped to someone’s head can shoot 23 million pixels into each eyeball, giving it the “equivalent of the resolution of a 75-inch TV.” From a technical perspective, the experience has been described as life-changing.  A Conde Nast reporter who tried the headset over a series of weeks said reality began to feel far less superior than the augmented version beamed into his eyes.  Mark Hurst, the CEO of online strategy consulting company Creative Good, criticized Apple’s new wearable tech product as an “isolating device.”  “It’s a face-hugging alien strapped to your face,” said Hurst, who hosts the radio show Techtonic on WFMU. “Apple can create whatever experience it wants. Whatever the experience, it’s only you having it.”  Last Spring, loneliness was defined as an epidemic by the US Surgeon General.  An 82-page study encouraged Americans to invest in social connections.  Hurst, 51, believes Apple’s new “hobby device” doesn’t encourage interaction because the headset places the user in a digital reality and separates them from others in the actual environment.  But it’s not just Apple, other companies, like Meta, have their own devices which are “basically the same category.”   Hurst is not against virtual reality as a concept but doesn’t think the $3 trillion company should act as a “gatekeeper” between this new world and its millions of users.  Other tech giants such as Meta, Netflix, Spotify, and Google may be wary of this prospect as well and are withholding their services from Apple’s new device at the moment.  The headset also has its kinks, according to Vanity Fair, which might prevent the average consumer from forking over roughly two weeks of income for the product.  Among the issues were the product’s 20-ounce weight, the hefty price, the apps appear...",-1
Apple sold enough iPhones and services last quarter to reverse a downward revenue trend,2024-02-01T22:31:09+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/apple-sold-enough-iphones-and-services-last-quarter-to-reverse-a-downward-revenue-trend-223109289.html?src=rss,"After four consecutive quarters of revenue decline, Apple broke the trend and reported its first period of revenue growth today. In its earnings report for the first quarter of the financial year of 2024, the company announced a quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, which is an increase of 2 percent from the same period last year. In addition, Apple CEO Tim Cook said its ""installed base of active devices has now surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all products and geographic segments."" This quarter includes money brought in from the sales of the iPhone 15 line introduced in September 2023, which had an obvious impact on performance. ""Today Apple is reporting revenue growth for the December quarter fueled by iPhone sales, and an all-time revenue record in Services,” Cook said. He noted the company hitting ""all-time revenue records across advertising, Cloud services, payment services and video as well as December quarter records in App Store and Apple Care."" Cook recapped some updates made to the Apple TV app, as well as TV+ content earning nominations and awards. Cook went on to remind us during the company's earnings call that tomorrow is the launch day for the Vision Pro headset, calling it historic. After saying that Apple is dedicated to investing in new technologies, Cook added that the company will be sharing more about its developments in AI later this year. Products in the wearables, home and accessories categories didn't fare well in this quarter, though sales in the Mac department did increase year over year. iPad sales in particular dropped 25 percent over the same period last year, though Cook attributed that to a ""difficult compare"" to the big numbers recorded in the first quarter of 2023 due to new models with refreshed Apple Silicon. Considering the company did not release a new iPad model in 2023 at all, this is not surprising. Cook continued by highlighting developments like Apple opening its 100th retail location in Asia Pacific and updates on its sustainability efforts. He wrapped up by saying ""Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges,"" adding ""so we're optimistic about the future, confident in the long term and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users.""

Apple ends yearlong sales slump with slight revenue rise in holiday-season period but stock slips,2024-02-01T22:11:36+00:00,https://wtop.com/business-finance/2024/02/apple-ends-yearlong-sales-slump-with-slight-revenue-rise-in-holiday-season-period-but-stock-slips/,"
The Associated Press  February 1, 2024, 6:45 PM SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple snapped out of a yearlong sales funk during its holiday-season quarter, propelled by solid demand for the latest model of its iPhone and still-robust growth in a services division facing legal threats that could undermine its prospects. The modest revenue growth announced Thursday as part of Apple’s October-December results ended four consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines. But the performance still may not be enough to allay recent investor concerns about Apple’s ability to rebuild the momentum that established it as the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company. After years of holding that mantle, Apple recently ceded the top spot to its long-time rival Microsoft, which has been elevated largely through its early leadership in artificial intelligence technology. Apple is hoping to shift the narrative back in its favor with Friday’s release of its Vision Pro headset that transports users into a hybrid of physical and digital environments — a combination the company is promoting as “spatial computing.” But the first version of the Vision Pro will cost $3,500 — a lofty price tag analysts expect to constrain demand this year. “We are optimistic about the future, confident in the long term, and excited as we have ever been,” Apple CEO Tim Cook assured analysts during a Thursday conference call about the latest quarterly results. Despite recurring worries that Apple may be entering a period of slower growth compared with its track record over the past 20 years, the Cupertino, California, is still thriving. Apple’s revenue for its most recent quarter rose 2% from the same time in the previous year to $119.58 billion. The company earned $33.92 billion, or $2.18 per share, a 13% gain from the same time last year. As usual, the iPhone accounted for the bulk of Apple’s revenue. Sales of the company’s marquee product totaled $69.7 billion in the past quarter, a 6% increase from the same time in the prior year. Those results include the latest iPhone that came out in late September, including a premium model that includes a special video recording feature designed for playing back on the Vision Pro. Apple’s services division, which is tied largely to the iPhone, posted an 11% rise in revenue from the previous year to $23.12 billion. Both the revenue and earnings for the quarter exceeded analysts’ projections, according to FactSet Research. But Apple issued a lukewarm forecast for the current January-March period that indicated iPhone sales will slip from last year, supporting the thesis that the company is mired in a financial malaise. That helped push down Apple’s stock price by more than 3% in Thursday’s extended trading. If the shares make a similar move during Friday’s regular trading session, Apple’s market value will have fallen nearly $200 billion, or 6%, so far this year. While it has been consistently generating double-digit revenue growth, Apple’s services ...",-2

Apple Promises 600 Apps For Vision Pro: Here Are The Ones We're Looking Forward To The Most,2024-02-01T22:10:53+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1507733/apple-vision-pro-600-apps-launch-what-were-looking-forward-to/,"
Apple's ambitious Vision Pro headset is due to hit the market on February 2, and the company has revealed more information about the 600+ apps that will be available at launch. The headset is a high-end offering designed to seamlessly blend work, interaction, and entertainment. It doesn't feature controllers, instead relying on hand tracking and movement for navigating the interface.





One major plus is the number of apps available for the device, even if they do overlap with Apple's other platforms. If Apple stays true to form, the apps will be highly polished and functional, including the VR-specific ones. Other standalone headsets have had decent hardware available, but struggled due to the limited number of apps available to them, and the quality of the apps they do have. 
Although reviewers have positive things to say about the hardware on offer, it is ultimately the available content which will decide if the Apple Vision Pro becomes a success, or an outlandishly expensive shelf ornament.

Arguably the best feature for people planning to work on the Vision Pro is the device's interface itself. It allows users to pull up and arrange multiple windows and AR widgets in a manner conducive to their workflow.





Common communication apps like Slack and Microsoft Teams are available on the device. Microsoft 365 is there, too, giving users access to a variety of office programs. You can even attend Zoom meetings through the Vision Pro headset. While it is basic, the fact there's a web browser also means you can access pretty much anything you currently use on your laptop as well.
If you're a business owner or anyone else who needs to spend time looking at large amounts of data, then the widget-based Numerics app may be incredibly useful for you. It can be used to keep track of a wide range of information, and customized to fit a user's needs.

Apple Reports 2% Increase in Revenue Fueled By iPhone Sales As Concerns in China Continue,2024-02-01T21:53:56+00:00,https://www.thewrap.com/apple-q1-earnings-2024/,"Net income grows 13% to $33.9 billion in first quarter, on revenue of $119.6 billion, ahead of Vision Pro launch on Friday Apple, facing persistent concerns about sluggish sales in China and nervous anticipation about the launch of its Vision Pro headset, reported Thursday that its fiscal first quarter 2024 revenue rose 2% on the strength of global iPhone sales.  The tech giant topped analysts estimates for revenue and earnings per share in the quarter, which ended on Dec. 31 and was composed of 13 weeks as opposed to the fourth quarter of 2023, which was composed of 14 weeks. After hours on Thursday, the company’s stock fell roughly 3%.  Here are the top-line results: Net Income: $33.92 billion, up 13% from the year-ago period. Earnings per share: $2.18, compared to $2.09 per share expected by Zacks Investment Research Revenue: $119.6 billion, compared to $117.62 billion expected by Zacks Investment Research  Apple CEO Tim Cook attributed the boost in revenue growth to iPhone sales and “all-time revenue record” in its services segment, which includes Apple TV+ and Apple Music. He said that Apple’s installed base of active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an “all-time high across all products and geographic segments.” On Friday Apple is scheduled to launch the Vision Pro headset, the latest Apple product. The headset, which is currently priced at $3,499 for the base model, will be available for purchase in the U.S. on Friday with buying options for consumers in other countries and territories to come. This quarter also saw an all-time record in earnings-per-share of $2.18, up 16 percent from last year, which the company credited to December’s performance as well as margin expansions on Apple’s products and services. During this quarter, the company was also able to return “almost $27 billion” to shareholders in dividends. Apple set revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions during the quarter, including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific. Emerging markets in Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland and Turkey also saw double digit growth during this time, the company said. Apple also saw an all-time record in paid subscriptions, which grew by double digits year over year. In services the company set an all-time net sales record of $23.1 billion, which marked 11% year over year increase. The segment made up 19% of Apple’s total sales for the quarter. “We are confident in our future, and continue to make significant investments across our business to support our long-term growth plans,” Apple CFO Luca Maestri said in the shareholder letter. Breaking down how Apple’s major devices performed, net sales for the iPhone came in at $69.7 billion, a 6% increase. That was followed by net sales for Mac, which came in at $7.8 billion, a 1% increase. The iPad and Apple Watch did not fare as well. Net sales for iPads came in at $7 billion, a 25% decrease compared to this time period last year. This decrease was cr...",2

Indeed, Apple would love the release of its Vision Pro to eventually be viewed as being as epochal as the iPod and iPhone arrivals of yesteryear. While the Vision Pro requires a ginormous investment of $3,499 out of the gate, at least there will be plenty of content for those early adopters to enjoy. iPhone 15 Pro with 100GB of data works out incredibly cheap Mobiles UK is offering a superb contract on an iPhone 15 Pro. It’s £9 down and £44.99 a month for 100GB of data on the iD Mobile network.
 Mobiles UK is offering a superb contract on an iPhone 15 Pro. It’s £9 down and £44.99 a month for 100GB of data on the iD Mobile network. Apple says there are more than 600 tailor-made apps, built specifically for the new mixed reality headset. Those are alongside more than a million compatible apps due to the opening up of iPad content from developers.  Considering much of the narrative in the build up to launch has been top streaming services like Netflix taking a wait and see attitude towards the headset – rather than launching an app to coincide with the release date – this is a significant haul. The company refers to the “spatial apps” as ways to “transform any room into a personal theatre for sports, TV shows, and films; unlock new ways to collaborate, create, and view digital content; and transport users to stunning gameplay environments and exciting new places.” Those apps will be enjoyable within the Vision Pro’s Infinite Campus described as “an ideal productivity tool for everyday tasks. The three-dimensional user interface frees apps from the boundaries of a display so they can appear side by side at any scale.” Apple has already announced some of the streaming services that’ll be available out of the gate, despite Netflix’s absence. They include: Disney+, ESPN, NBA, MLB, PGA Tour, Max, Discovery+, Amazon Prime Video, Paramount+, Peacock, Pluto TV, Tubi, Fubo, Crunchyroll, Red Bull TV, IMAX, and TikTok. There’ll also be 200 3D movies to enjoy from some of those sources from within the Apple TV app. The Vision Pro App Store is now live, enabling users to view previews for the experiences on the web in a new tab showcasing screenshots, so you can begin scanning here.

Apple Vision Pro Release Date: What You Need to Know,2024-02-01T21:00:49+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/apple-vision-pro-release-date/,"Published on By The Apple Vision Pro release date is set for tomorrow. Here are the most important things buyers, and prospective buyers, need to know.  Apple’s new, and expensive, Vision Pro spatial computer/headset launches in the United States on Friday. The device starts at $3,499 and the price point hasn’t scared shoppers away. With just hours to go before shipments start arriving and Apple Stores open their doors to sell additional stock and offer demos, w we want to run down the most important tidbits you need to know about release day. Table of Contents First, and perhaps foremost, Apple Vision Pro pre-orders have sold out for release day delivery. You can still buy the Vision Pro from Apple’s website, but you won’t get the device until March at the earliest. This is for all configurations of which there are three: 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB.  As a reminder, if you’re buying the Vision Pro online, plan accordingly. You’ll need to  scan your face so you can lock in your headband and face seal measurements. This is important because it ensures the device fits properly. If you use a prescription for your eyeballs, you’ll also need to have that information handy in order to buy custom optical inserts. If you want your Vision Pro sooner, you can try your luck at an Apple Store tomorrow. Physical retail locations will have stock on hand though we don’t know how much each store will have. It’s a bit of a gamble. If you can’t find what you’re looking for tomorrow, you have options though none of them are great. The Vision Pro is currently on sale at resellers like eBay though you won’t find it for anywhere close to MSRP. You’ll need to pay a premium in order to get a swift delivery. If you pre-ordered a Vision Pro, and you got a February delivery date, make sure you check your order.  In late January, Apple pushed the shipping dates for some Apple Vision Pro pre-orders that were originally supposed to arrive on February 2nd. Some buyers received an email stating their pre-order’s shipping date had been moved from February 2nd to a date as far back as March 7th. And users who called to inquire about the delay said Apple gave them a shipping window that stretched as far back as March 14th. Bottom line, if you pre-ordered, keep a close eye on it. And if your Vision Pro has shipped, make sure you track it all the way to your doorstep. If you’re a skeptic, or you simply want to try before you buy, Apple will start offering Vision Pro demos at Apple Store locations starting tomorrow.  At 8AM local time, Apple Stores in the U.S. will allow customers to sign up for a demo appointment. Slots will be filled on a first come, first serve basis and the demo will last around 20 to 25 minutes. The demo will presumably cover all the important information about Apple’s new device including setup, applications, and the visionOS operating system. If your Vision Pro is set to arrive on February 2nd, there will likely be a software upgrade waiting for you. Earlier this we...",2

Think again. If you’re choosing between an apple from your own backyard and an apple flown across the continent, the food miles are the difference. But what about when you want to eat something that you can’t grow, or when nothing is growing in your backyard? It turns out that what you eat is far more important than where it is produced, especially if you want to eat a sustainable diet all year. For the parts of the United States and Canada experiencing winter weather, eating locally grown food in February means frozen or fermented vegetables, fruit preserves, and perhaps fresh kale from a greenhouse. You’re more likely to have a variety of meat, fowl, fish, dairy and eggs available from local producers than fresh fruits and vegetables. Just a few generations ago, living at these latitudes meant fearing that your family might run out of food at this time of year. You’d do everything you could to add meat and dairy to the stored apples (and apple cider), potatoes, and root vegetables that would get you through until spring. But today if you walk into supermarkets across North America, you’re very likely to find fresh bananas, no matter the season. With 84% of households buying them, they are the most popular fruit sold in the United States. Yet no banana is locally grown for anyone in this country outside of Hawaii. Bananas stop growing at temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit and die if temperatures dip below 28 degrees. Rather than growing them, we import them from Guatemala, Ecuador, Costa Rica and other warm countries that can produce bananas all year long. In your local grocery store, if you keep walking from the produce to the meat section, you’re also likely to find beef, produced right here in the United States. In fact, beef cattle are raised in all 50 states of the Union. Chances are that the bananas in the store have traveled thousands of miles more than the steaks. Which one, per ounce, has a higher carbon footprint: the imported bananas or the domestic beef?Advertisement Our World in Data, a collaboration between the University of Oxford and the Global Change Data Lab, published a deep dive into the greenhouse gas emissions across t...",0
You don't need Vision Pro to enjoy iPhone 15 Pro Spatial Video in VR,2024-02-01T20:51:35+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/you-dont-need-vision-pro-to-enjoy-iphone-15-pro-spatial-video-in-vr-4413922,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience.

The Apple Vision Pro is out in the United States tomorrow (Feb 2) and many early adopters will be excited to try one of the killer features – the Spatial Videos captured by the iPhone 15 Pro. However, you won’t need to splash out $3,499 on Apple’s new mixed reality headset to enjoy the immersive 3D videos, provided you’ve already spent upwards of a grand on one of Apple’s newest iPhones in order to capture them in the first place. iPhone 15 Pro with 100GB of data works out incredibly cheap Mobiles UK is offering a superb contract on an iPhone 15 Pro. It’s £9 down and £44.99 a month for 100GB of data on the iD Mobile network.
 Mobiles UK is offering a superb contract on an iPhone 15 Pro. It’s £9 down and £44.99 a month for 100GB of data on the iD Mobile network. Meta has today announced an update enabling support for Spatial Video on its Quest VR headsets, which are decidedly less expensive than Apple’s new head mounted display. It’ll be possible by uploading the content via the Meta Quest mobile app, from which they can be streamed. “When you put on your Meta Quest headset, simply select the spatial video content in the Files menu for an immersive viewing experience. You can manage your spatial video content from either the Meta Quest mobile app gallery or in the spatial videos section of the Files menu in your headset,” Meta says in the announcement. Meta said it has uploaded some samples for you to experience what the feature has to offer, which is also handy if you don’t have an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max capable of capturing them. Apple introduced Spatial Video with the iPhone 15 Pro range. It combines simultaneous recordings from two of the iPhone 15 Pro‘s three cameras to capture the footage in 3D, enabling users to effectively relive experiences shot from a first-person perspective on a display that encapsulates their field of vision. Meta Quest v62 Update also includes game pad support for the Meta Quest Browser, while adding support for the DualSense and DualShock 4 controllers. The update also includes the addition of single gesture quick actions for Meta Quest.  “Rather than having to navigate through a menu, you can now perform these actions by looking down at your palm and performing one simple gesture—just a short pinch to show and hide the Universal Menu or a long pinch to recenter the display,” Meta says.

Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now,2024-02-01T19:51:00+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals,"By  Sheena Vasani, a writer covering commerce, e-readers, and tech news. She previously wrote about everything from web development to AI at Inside. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. If you know where to look, you can often score discounts on Apple’s ever-popular AirPods. Since Apple launched the third-gen AirPods at the end of 2021, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model slowly dip to under $100. And now that the latest AirPods Pro has been on the market for over a year, we’re also seeing their price fall more often, too. We’re even seeing great deals land on the newer updated AirPods Pro with USB-C. Here, we’ve curated the best deals currently available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max. These AirPods are Apple’s second generation of true wireless earbuds and the cheapest model in the AirPods lineup. In 2021, Apple lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — from $159 to $129. It now only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found that the easy-to-use, second-gen AirPods still offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case. For Black Friday, Apple’s most affordable pair of earbuds dropped to an all-time low of $69 ($60 off) at Walmart and other retailers. For now, however, the second-gen earbuds with a Lightning charging case are on sale at Walmart for $89 ($49 off) and for $10 more from Amazon. The model with the wireless charging case, meanwhile, is on sale at Adorama for $119.99 ($30 off).  Apple’s latest entry-level earbuds are water-resistant, sport better battery life than the 2019 model, and come with a Lightning-only or MagSafe-compatible charging case. Similar in appearance to their sleeker sibling, the AirPods Pro, the latest entry-level AirPods boast a new charging case and shorter stems. They’re also water resistant, unlike the 2019 model, and sport better battery life. With support for the company’s MagSafe technology and an asking price of $179, Apple’s third-gen AirPods are often considered the middle child in Apple’s current AirPods lineup. The shorter stems make for a more subtle design, too, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model. In 2022, Apple quietly introduced a new, slightly cheaper option of the third-gen AirPods that comes with a Lightning-only charging case, which are currently available at Amazon and Target for $149.99 ($20 off). However, we recommend the earbuds with a MagSafe charging case, which are currently down to $149.99 ($30 off) at Costco through April 1st. Note that if you’re not ...",1

The iPhone 15 Pro is the ultimate upgrade for Apple fans right now and if you’ve been waiting since September for the right deal, this one is hard to ignore. Mobiles UK is offering the iPhone 15 Pro with 100GB of data for £44.99 a month with just a £19 upfront cost. iPhone 15 Pro with 100GB of data works out incredibly cheap Mobiles UK is offering a superb contract on an iPhone 15 Pro.

 Mobiles UK is offering a superb contract on an iPhone 15 Pro. It’s £9 down and £44.99 a month for 100GB of data on the iD Mobile network. Considering this phone costs £999 to buy outright, you’re paying a grand total of £1,098.76 over two years for this deal. That means you’re getting two -ears of mobile service and all that lovely data for under £100 on top of the asking price of the phone itself. The contract is for 24-months and comes with unlimited minutes and text messages. You’re getting a brand new iPhone 15 Pro in black with 128GB of on-board storage. It comes on the iD Mobile network where you’ll get access to 5G data. iD Mobile is an MVNO that uses the Three mobile network infrastructure. The iPhone 15 Pro is Apple’s sexiest phone update for a while, thanks to the new ultra-light titanium framing with a brushed finish. It’s also the first to include the new Action Button replacing the iPhone’s traditional mute switch. Elsewhere, it’s Apple’s most powerful handset ever thanks to the A17 Bionic chip, the first to be constructed from a 3nm architecture. It’s also the first that can handle console-quality games like Resident Evil Village. It’s also got a 6.1-inch display with a variable 1-120Hz variable refresh rate, so it’ll fit in your pocket a little more comfortably compared to the Pro Max model. Our reviewer said it provided a “top-end viewing experience.” The cameras are great in most conditions and it’s lightweight and comfortable to hold. We gave the phone a four-star review because of those factors and felt only the same 3x telephoto lens and sluggish charging (which is the same on all Apple phones) letting the side down.

Don’t Buy an iPad Pro or iPad Air Right Now,2024-02-01T18:45:30+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/dont-buy-an-ipad-pro-or-ipad-air-right-now/,"Published on By Unless you’re desperate, you shouldn’t buy a new iPad Pro or iPad Air right now.  If you’re looking to upgrade to a new iPad, you’ve got plenty of options. Apple’s current iPad Pro, the 2022 model, is still in excellent shape. The same goes for the iPad Air 5 which is the latest version of the iPad Air. However, these devices will get replaced in the near future and they’re successors will have some really intriguing changes on board. Last year, for the first time since the iPad’s inception, Apple failed to release a new iPad model. That will change this year. Apple hasn’t confirmed yet, but it will happen. Over the past year or so we’ve seen rumor after rumor outline new 2024 iPad Pros and a new iPad Air 6. In particular, the new iPad Pros look like they’ll take a huge leap from the previous generation. Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman is calling it the “biggest revamp ever” for the product line. The iPad Air 6 looks like it will be more of a refresh, but a few of the rumored changes should help it separate from the iPad Air 5. Table of Contents The devices should arrive soon. And that should may enough to give most shoppers a reason to pause. If not, there are other reasons as well. If you can hold out for a little bit longer, you should.  We don’t have an official launch date for the 2024 iPad Pro’s or the iPad Air 6, but every credible rumor suggests they’ll launch at the end of March or sometime in April. If your current tablet still functions, and your budget allows, we highly recommend waiting for Apple’s announcements. These devices will have some big time upgrades on board. Nothing is certain right now given the lack of an official announcement, but here’s what you need to know: 2024 iPad Pros iPad Air 6 You may think you don’t or won’t need some or all of these features, but you won’t know for sure until you’re able to go hands-on and compare the new models to the previous generation. When Apple announces these new models, it will likely switch up the price points of its current iPad lineup.  If Apple continues to sell the older iPad Pros and iPad Air, you can expect their prices to drop. Retailers around the world will respond in kind. We should see price cuts that don’t require a trade-in and we may see price cuts on top Android tablets as well. This is a one time deal for 2024. We won’t see new iPad Pro or iPad Air models launch later in 2024 though we’ll probably see a new iPad mini 7 launch in the fall. And with the launch and guaranteed price cuts just a few days away, those of you in need of a new iPad would be wise to control those urges and hold onto your current device for a little bit longer.

Niantic is bringing an AR skateboarding game to Apple Vision Pro,2024-02-01T18:37:40+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/niantic-is-bringing-an-ar-skateboarding-game-to-apple-vision-pro-183740925.html?src=rss,"Pokémon Go creator Niantic is bringing an AR skateboarding game to the Apple Vision Pro mixed-reality headset. The company teamed up with Reality Crisis, another player in the AR gaming space, to create Rodney Mullen’s SKATRIX. For the uninitiated, Mullen is a professional skateboarder who is credited with creating a number of iconic tricks, including the ollie and the kickflip. This is the first augmented-reality skateboard game ever, unless you count using an actual skateboard to speed around town catching pocket monsters in Pokémon Go. Niantic says the gameplay will involve players navigating the real world to “explore and collect skatepark elements.” The game will use the same AR precision elements as the company’s other titles to “turn the world into an endless skatepark.” A gameplay demo shows an avatar skating in real-world locations like parking lots and inside of washing machines. However, there’s one really expensive elephant in the room. The Apple Vision Pro costs $3,500 and isn’t exactly suited to removing from the living room, let alone the home. You’ll also look pretty stupid wearing Apple’s bulky ski goggles while out and about, not to mention it’d be mighty easy to snag it from your head and race away, perhaps on a real-life skateboard. To that end, Niantic and Reality Labs are also bringing the game to standard mobile devices, including iOS and Android smartphones. Much of the gameplay is still under wraps, but Niantic promises that players will be able to share custom-made skateparks with other users on both mobile devices and mixed-reality headsets. Rodney Mullen’s SKATRIX will be released sometime this year. As for the Apple Vision Pro, the device looks to be getting all kinds of apps. The headset will have access to Microsoft’s entire 365 productivity suite at launch, along with a Zoom app. All told, Apple says there will be 600 apps available for tomorrow’s release. Apple's AirPods Pro (second-generation) are $60 off in a deal on Amazon, bringing the price don to just $190. The AirPods Pro normally cost $250. They come with active noise cancellation, adaptive audio, and personalized spatial audio. To find out all the details of watching and recording the total solar eclipse on April 8, read on. Former Geek Squad workers who lost their jobs this week told 404 Media that Best Buy is conducting mass layoffs, though no numbers have yet been confirmed. Many have posted on Reddit to say they're ""going sleeper."" A report by The New York Times claims both OpenAI and Google transcribed videos from YouTube and used these texts to train their AI models, possibly violating copyrights. OpenAI reportedly transcribed more than one million hours of YouTube videos. Retro gaming console emulator apps are now welcome on the Apple App Store and can even offer downloadable games.

The Vision Pro App Store has already tripled in size,2024-02-01T18:12:35+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/the-vision-pro-app-store-has-already-tripled-in-size/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? Apple just announced a surge in Vision Pro apps, nearly tripling the best estimates from late January. Apple states that the Vision Pro will have at least 600 native apps on February 2, an impressive beginning for a VR headset. That’s particularly good news for early adopters who will start receiving the Vision Pro tomorrow. Among the new apps, Apple highlighted Box, an immersive content browser app for enterprise and education. Product models can be viewed within your room in full 3D. Box posted a YouTube video demonstrating how an automotive powertrain can be taken from a window and spun to see any angle. Meanwhile, MindNode, OmniFocus, and OmniPlan help you organize and manage projects more effectively. Fantastical is a popular calendar app that lets you sync and plan with any Apple device, even the Vision Pro. Numerics is a business visualization app that presents several live widgets. Widgets support over 4,000 key performance indicators (KPI) and can be placed anywhere in your space to help keep track of your important data. The streaming service, Max, also announced that its native app will be available at launch on February 2. It will include an “Iron Throne Room” immersive environment for subscribers, where “fans can transform their space” into the throne room from House of the Dragon. Beyond all the newly announced apps, the Vision Pro will still have a full suite of Apple system apps, access to Apple TV+ and several other video streaming services, and Apple Arcade. Less than two weeks ago, Apple analyst Mark Gurman said there were about 230 apps, leading to some concern about a slow start. So far, about 230 visionOS native apps are ready for release. That’ll likely rise by Feb. 2 – but I doubt significantly. There are new AR heavy apps coming from Lowe’s and JCrew, and the rest are from indie developers or the entertainment + productivity apps Apple has announced. &mdash; Mark Gurman (@markgurman) January 21, 2024 While the tripling in size in impressive for a device of its type, it’s quite slow for a new Apple product category. The Apple Watch arrived in 2015 with 3,000 apps at launch, for example. Of course, developing apps for the tiny 2D screen of an Apple Watch and watchOS is much simpler than creating visionOS apps that harness the potential of an immersive computer that tracks your gaze and overlays super-sharp text and graphics in multiple windows that float in your room. Still, Apple claims the Vision Pro will have over a million compatible apps, the majority of those being iPad apps that also work on the Vision Pro in 2D windows. Everywhere you look, the failure of Apple’s secret self-driving car is dominating the news. Yet, it comes shortly after another moonshot project -- the Vision Pro -- launched to higher-than-expected initial sales. Why did one crash and burn while the other was successfully brought to market? Well, Bloomberg rep...",3
‘Argylle’ Won’t Do Much to Break the Current Box Office Slump,2024-02-01T18:00:00+00:00,https://www.thewrap.com/argylle-box-office-preview/,"

 The Apple-produced spy film is projected for an opening weekend of just $18 million After two weeks of no major film releases, movie theaters are in great need of a fresh hit to break the late-winter box office drought. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like Universal/Apple’s “Argylle” will be that big hit.  Tracking for Matthew Vaughn’s spy thriller is projecting an opening weekend of $18 million, half of the $36.2 million opening that Vaughn’s 2014 film “Kingsman: The Secret Service” earned.  For most legacy studio productions, that would be a bust. But Apple is playing by different rules.  Flush with cash from non-entertainment revenue streams, the Silicon Valley tech giant has built a strategy of spending big bucks on original films from big name filmmakers — Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” and Ridley Scott’s “Napoleon,” for example — and signing deals with legacy studios to theatrically distribute the film with a full window.

Meta Quest adds support for Apple’s Spatial Video ahead of Vision Pro launch,2024-02-01T17:59:13+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/meta-quest-adds-support-for-apples-spatial-video-ahead-of-vision-pro-launch/,"Apple’s brand-new Vision Pro headset has lost one of its competitive advantages over rivals, as Meta announced today that it, too, will add support for spatial video playback on its more affordable Meta Quest. Spatial video, also known as stereoscopic videos, are videos Apple customers themselves can film with any iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max. Support for the feature rolled out with the release of iOS 17.2 in December, letting users film in three dimensions, so they could later relive their favorite memories through Apple’s mixed-reality headset. While Meta’s adoption of the feature is a win for Apple in making spatial video more of a standard for 3D recordings, it also makes Meta’s headset more competitive with Apple’s Vision Pro. Starting at $3,500, but costing closer to $4,600 with the necessary add-ons and accessories, as The New York Times reports, Apple’s headset is out of reach for many consumers. Meta’s Quest line-up, by comparison, has lower-cost options including the currently $250 Quest 2, $500 Quest 3 and $1,000 Quest Pro. Apple’s spatial video will be supported on Meta Quest devices via the v62 software update that’s beginning to roll out now, Meta says. Afterward, customers will be able to upload their spatial video recordings to their Meta headset using the Quest mobile app, allowing them to experience their memories in 3D. Meta says the uploaded content will be converted for playback on the Meta Quest hardware and stored in the cloud, and users will be able to select the videos from the “Files” menu when they want to watch them. In addition, users will be able to manage their videos from the Meta Quest mobile app gallery or the new spatial videos section of the Files menu on your headset. Meta also created some demo videos that customers can view to get a taste of the experience, even if they don’t own an iPhone 15 Pro device. Other improvements in the coming update include support for external gamepads, including PlayStation, Xbox and others. PlayStation 5 DualSense Wireless Controllers and PlayStation 4 DualShock will also gain enhanced support, Meta says. The gamepad can connect both via Bluetooth or USB-C and can be used with games like Halo Infinite or Forza Horizon 5 with the Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) App. (The latter requires a supported headset and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership.) Facebook livestreaming is also now available to all Meta Quest users, after its original release in the v56 update, the company noted. Users will be able to “go live” from the Camera icon in the Universal Menu, so they can stream their VR activities to their friends. Those streaming to YouTube will now also see their chats while livestreaming with the new update.  Plus, Meta Quest users will now be able to perform common actions by looking down at their palm and then performing a simple gesture — like a short pinch to show and hide the Universal Menu or a long pinch to recenter the display. This change is likely Meta’s response to Vis...",-2
Will Apple Release iOS 17.3.1 for iPhone?,2024-02-01T17:57:16+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/will-apple-release-ios-17-3-1-for-iphone/,"Published on By In the aftermath of iOS 17.3’s release, and Apple’s decision to close off the downgrade back to iOS 17.2.1, iPhone users are wondering if Apple will release a new iOS 17.3.1 update. Good news, it looks like it will.  In January, Apple pulled its iOS 17.3 update out of beta and pushed it to millions of iPhone users around the world. And while we haven’t heard about any widespread problems with the firmware, some iPhone users have run into trouble after upgrading. Many problems can be solved at home, but some may require a fix from Apple. And with Apple closing off a safety valve, the ability to downgrade back to older iOS software, iPhone users are looking for answers. Apple’s currently testing iOS 17.4, the fourth milestone upgrade for iOS 17, and a major release for iPhone. iOS 17.4 has a ton of changes on board including new emoji characters for the iPhone’s keyboard and we expect it to deliver bug fixes for lingering iOS 17 problems. However, iOS 17.4’s release is still a ways away. As of right now, we expect iOS 17.4 to arrive in early March in order to comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act. Apple must comply by March 6th. That’s a world away for iPhone owners with software issues and some users we’ve talked to are hoping Apple releases an iOS 17.3.1 update to bridge the gap. Fortunately, it looks like it will.  The company hasn’t confirmed an update, but we, and others, have seen it show up in site analytics yet. New, unannounced iOS software updates often show up in web analytics shortly before they’re released to the public. Apple also sticks to predictable patterns with its software releases and history says we may see new software arrive in mid-February ahead of iOS 17.4. Last year, Apple pushed iOS 16.3.1 to iPhone users on February 13th. In 2022, Apple released iOS 15.3.1 for iPhone on February 10th. If we go back further, the company released iOS 14.4.1 on March 8th and iOS 13.3.1 on January 28th. So while we saw a pattern emerge in 2023 and 2022, Apple didn’t adhere to it in 2021 and 2020. That being said, Apple almost always provides a bridge between milestone upgrades, iOS 17.2.1 being the most recent example. It landed between iOS 17.2 and iOS 17.3. So, simply put, there’s no guarantee we see an iOS 17.3.1 update for iPhone, but there are signs. If you’re dealing with problems on iOS 17.3, or another version of iOS 17, keep your eyes peeled for a new firmware update this week and next. If security is important to you, think about installing Apple's iOS 17.4.1 update right away. The iOS 17.4.1 update includes two security patches. These patches will help keep your device and its data protected from harm. And that makes iOS 17.4.1 an important upgrade. If you missed iOS 17.4 and older software, you'll get the security patches from updates you missed when you upgrade to iOS 17.4.1. iOS 17.4 had four security patches on board.  The update also delivered quantum security protection for iMessage. The company says the ...",1
Here is Apple’s official ‘jailbroken’ iPhone for security researchers,2024-02-01T17:41:31+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/here-is-apples-official-jailbroken-iphone-for-security-researchers/,"Smashed iPhones are seen during COP28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates on November 30, 2023. Image Credits: Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images Smashed iPhones are seen during COP28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates on November 30, 2023. Image Credits: Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images In 2019, Apple announced it would start sending some security researchers a “special” version of the iPhone designed to be used to find vulnerabilities, which could then be reported to Apple so the company could fix them. In 2020, the company started shipping the devices, which are designed to have some security features disabled, making it easier for researchers to hunt bugs in iOS. Before these devices existed, there was a loosely organized group of hackers and security researchers who were hell-bent on removing the restrictions Apple put on iPhones, known as the “jailbreakers.” The term came from the concept of breaking out of Apple’s security restrictions — dubbed a “jail” — on the iPhone. The jailbreaker’s goals were sometimes just to have fun getting around restrictions, such as sideloading apps not included in the official App Store, and — back in the day — to simply change the iPhone’s background before that feature was enabled. Despite these seemingly innocuous goals, Apple waged war against the jailbreakers for years, discouraging people from disabling the security features of their iPhones. There is still at least one Apple support page that calls jailbreaking “unauthorized modifications” to iOS. As for these days, Apple appears to have embraced the term jailbreaking by using it in the official instructions of the Security Research Device, according to a picture posted on X (previously Twitter) by security researcher Gergely Kalman. “We’ve made it simple to get your existing tooling running on the Security Research Device.

The Epic-Apple antitrust saga isn’t over yet,2024-02-01T17:24:59+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/01/the-epic-apple-antitrust-saga-isnt-over-yet/,"Fortnite maker Epic Games is preparing to fight Apple in court over how Apple has chosen to comply with a court order that required the tech giant to change its App Store rules. In the antitrust case filed by Epic Games, a district court judge in Northern California ruled that app developers should be able to point their users to links or buttons that connected to their websites, where their customers could learn about other ways to pay for apps beyond Apple’s in-app purchase. Apple agreed to allow such links, but said it would still take a 27% commission on those sales — a decision that Epic dubbed a case of “malicious compliance.” The injunction on Apple’s “anti-steering rule,” as it’s called, came about after both parties appealed the district court’s ruling. The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the original ruling, which Apple had largely won, as the court ruled it was not a monopolist engaging in anticompetitive behavior. However, it did say that Apple would have to update its App Store Guidelines’ anti-steering clause. After the Supreme Court in January declined to hear the antitrust case, the lower court’s ruling stood. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney had blasted Apple over its compliance, calling it written in “bad faith” and saying it “totally undermines the order.” He said Epic planned to challenge Apple in court over the matter. Now Epic has filed a notice of non-compliance with the District Court of Northern California which advises the court that Epic “disputes Apple’s purported compliance” with the injunction. It also noted that Epic plans to file a motion to demonstrate the issues with Apple’s new terms and ask for relief. Apple filed its “Notice of Compliance” with the court on January 16, 2024, where it described how its new App Store Review Guidelines would work. In it, the company explained that it would allow app developers to promote their subscriptions on the web, but with a 27% commission rate instead of 30%. For developers who are part of Apple’s Small Business Program or who offer auto-renewing subscriptions in year two, the fee is reduced to 12% instead of 15%. That 3% discount in many cases wouldn’t even cover the developer’s payment processing fees. In other words, they wouldn’t save money by switching to their own payment systems. In fact, they might even end up paying more than through Apple’s in-app purchases. However, Apple believes it’s owed a commission because of the investment it makes in its iOS platform, developer tools and App Store, which go beyond the payment processing fee. This view of its value was also visible in its response to the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), a new regulation that forces it to allow alternative app stores and third-party payments, among other things. Apple unveiled a complex system that involves reduced commissions, but tacks on a new “core technology fee” to make up for its losses, arguably because of said investments. In addition to the 3% discount Apple agreed...",-2

According to court records, only one of the suspects arrested in the Wednesday thefts — Tyler Mims — has been formally charged so far. Two men stole the phones from the store and fled in a red Dodge truck. It was stopped later in East Oakland and the three suspects were arrested and the phones recovered, police said. Mims, 22, who has addresses in both Berkeley and Sacramento, is also the suspect in several thefts at the Emeryville Apple store, including one Monday where video surveillance captured a man stuffing 50 iPhones with a retail value of some $49,000 into his pants before fleeing to a double-parked car. According to court records, Mims was formally charged Friday with 16 felony and misdemeanor counts stemming from the thefts at the two stores, including multiple counts of second degree burglary, organized retail theft, grand theft of personal property, and receiving stolen property. He was being held in lieu of $420,000 bail at Santa Rita Jail and is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday. No charges have been filed yet against the other two suspects, a 28-year-old Oakland man and a 20-year-old Berkeley woman. The man remained in custody Friday morning but the woman has been released, according to jail records. Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group",-1

Linux goes nuclear: Fedora Atomic Desktops are here to nuke Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS into oblivion,2024-02-09T22:43:57+00:00,https://betanews.com/2024/02/09/fedora-atomic-desktop-linux-microsoft/,"In a move that might just set off shockwaves through the halls of both Microsoft and Apple, Fedora has detonated its latest innovation: Fedora Atomic Desktops, a new family of Linux spins that combines cutting-edge technology with atomic precision. Marrying the reliability of Linux with the groundbreaking rpm-ostree system not only simplifies the Fedora ecosystem but also poses a formidable challenge to traditional operating systems. The inception of Project Atomic a decade ago marked the beginning of Fedora’s journey into atomic updates with the development of Atomic Host. This project laid the groundwork for what would evolve into today’s rpm-ostree-based spins, including the transformation of Fedora Atomic Workstation into the now well-known Fedora Silverblue. The expansion continued with the introduction of Fedora Kinoite in Fedora 35 and was followed by the recent additions of Sericea in Fedora 38 and Onyx in Fedora 39. These developments underscore the growing interest and investment in atomic spin versions across the Fedora ecosystem. The need for a new brand stems from several factors. Firstly, the anticipation of more atomic spins in the future. Fedora has experiments underway for additional desktop environments, such as Vauxite (Xfce) and the potential inclusion of others like Pantheon or COSMIC. Secondly, the diversity of atomic spins has made communication about them cumbersome. The introduction of Fedora Atomic Desktops aims to alleviate confusion, providing a singular, coherent term that encompasses all atomic spins, thus simplifying discussions, documentation, and searches related to rpm-ostree implementations. Lastly, the term ‘atomic’ more accurately reflects the nature of these spins. The atomic approach to updates offers a balance between stability and flexibility, allowing for rollbacks and rebases, which is a core advantage of using rpm-ostree technology. The Fedora Atomic Desktops family consists of: This rebranding retains the names Silverblue and Kinoite due to their established brand recognition and extensive resource library. The newer spins, Sericea and Onyx, have adopted the new naming convention to align with the unified branding strategy. Going forward, all new atomic spins will follow the “Fedora (DE name) Atomic” naming format, clarifying the desktop environment each spin is based on and ensuring consistency across the board. This change promises to eliminate confusion around naming and enhance the clarity of what sets these Fedora spins apart from their traditional counterparts. This latest move serves as a stark warning to Microsoft and other industry giants, such as Apple, that the future of computing won't be dictated by those who stick to the status quo. © 1998-2024 BetaNews, Inc.

Republican pols want stiffer penalties to curb historic wave of car thefts,2024-02-09T22:38:18+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/09/metro/republican-pols-want-stiffer-penalties-to-curb-historic-wave-of-car-thefts/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Republican lawmakers want to make it easier to lock up car thieves as a historic rise in stolen vehicles continues to slam New Yorkers. New legislation introduced by Staten Island Assemblyman Michael Reilly (R-Staten Island) would increase the penalty for repeat car thieves, including making the crimes bail eligible. Big Apple car thefts have soared recently, escalating to 13,500 stolen vehicles last year – the highest since 2006. “What this legislation is going to do, it’s going to address and help law enforcement combat that,” Reilly told reporters outside the 122 NYPD Precinct Friday. Reilly’s bill would allow a repeat car thief to be charged with aggravated grand larceny, a felony that allows judges to hold someone in custody under New York’s lax bail laws. It would also give district attorneys the ability to request judges try 16 and 17-year-old offenders be tried as adults. “These individuals know that they can get away with anything,” Staten Island Borough President Vito Fosello, said alongside Reilly. “If you steal a car, whether it be on Staten Island or anyplace across the state, it’s a joke,” Fosello continued. “You get a slap on the wrist, if you get anything. And last summer in particular. It was like happy hunting season, where sometimes people got two cars stolen from their house in a single day. And if you caught him and you’re lucky, nothing happened!” Car thefts have been on the rise in recent years, with the problem further exacerbated by a TikTok trend showing how to bypass anti-theft devices in Kia and Hyundai vehicles. Reilly’s legislation is carried by Sen. Andrew Lanza (R-Staten Island) in the state Senate. Last year, Gov. Kathy Hochul rolled out an effort to beef up law enforcement to handle the wave of Kia and Hyundai-related thefts. “Our local law enforcement, who wants to be out there solving other crimes has had to be diverted, their attention diverted, our criminal justice system diverted, because of this phenomenon,” Hochul said announcing her initiative in September. Hochul’s initiative included $50 million in targeted funding to support law enforcement technology. Advertisement",0

Khalid has covered tech, surveillance policy, consumer gadgets, and online communities for more than a decade.  The big-spending golden age of streaming is over, and as 2024 begins, services like Netflix, Disney, and Prime Video are cutting back production, raising prices, and piling on ads. Still, even if there aren’t quite as many new shows and movies to add to your binge-watching menu as the past few years, there will still be some worth waiting for.  And even after a merger or two (with rumors of more to come), the list of streaming platforms is still long, including Netflix, Hulu, Paramount Plus, Prime Video, Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, Peacock, Max, and a few others.  The new releases to look forward to include things like Constellation (Apple TV Plus, February 21st), Avatar: The Last Airbender (February 22nd, Netflix), The Regime (Max, March 3rd), Palm Royale (Apple TV Plus, March 20th), Fallout (April 12th, Prime Video), as well as new seasons or spinoffs of popular shows like Bridgerton, The Rings of Power, Yellowstone, The Mandalorian, Hacks, The Traitors, and many others.

Here's How to Try Apple's New AI Image Editor,2024-02-09T21:45:00+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/heres-how-to-try-apples-new-ai-image-editor-1851244272,"There’s a new Apple image editor, if you know where to look. The iPhone kings teamed up with researchers at the University of California at Santa Barbara to build a tool that lets you edit photos and images with text-based instructions. It doesn’t have an official release, but the researchers are hosting a demo you can try for yourself, first spotted by Extreme Tech.  The project is called Multimodal Large Language Model Guided Image Editing (MGIE). There are a lot of AI image editors on the market right now. Photoshop now comes with AI tools built in, and others such as OpenAI’s DALL-E let you edit images in addition to generating them out of whole cloth. If you’ve ever tried to use them, however, you know it can be a little frustrating. In many cases, the AI has a hard time understanding exactly what you’re looking for. The innovation with MGIE is adding another layer of AI interpretation. When you tell the AI what you want to see, MGIE first uses a text-based AI to make your instructions more explicit and descriptive. “Experimental results demonstrate that expressive instructions are crucial to instruction-based image editing,” the researchers said in a paper published on arXiv. “Our MGIE can lead to a notable improvement.” Apple published an open-source version of the software on GitHub. If you’re savvy you can get a version of MGIE running on your own, but the researchers set up the tool on Hugging Face. It runs a little slow when there are a lot of people using it, but it’s a fun experiment.  Gigantic tech companies like Apple spend billions of dollars on projects that no one ever gets to see, so it’s entirely possible this so-called MGIE tool will never get an official release. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  We took it for a spin ourselves here at the Gizmodo office. I uploaded a picture of my colleague and closest advisor Kyle Barr wearing a strange pair of sunglasses he picked up at a Netflix at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show. I told the AI “the man is standing in the desert.” Before generating the image, the MGIE tool extrapolated:  “The man is wearing a metal helmet and standing in a desert setting.The environment around him is arid and barren, with sand dunes stretching as far as the eye can see.” After playing around with the tool for far longer than we should have, it’s clearly subject to a lot of the same limitations as any other AI image generator. A lot of the time, the results are bizarre and nothing like what you asked for. But in some cases, it did an impressive job, and in defense of the program, AI does better with familiar subjects. “Familiar” is not something you would call Kyle’s sunglasses.",2
"British great-grandfather, 82, survives being run over by car after Apple Watch calls for help",2024-02-09T21:40:13+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/09/news/british-great-grandfather-82-survives-being-run-over-by-car-after-apple-watch-calls-for-help/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 A British great-grandfather survived being hit by a car after his Apple Watch automatically called emergency services for him.  Tony Jauncey, 82, was crossing the street near a roundabout in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, England on Jan. 19 when a motorist plowed into him. The great-grandfather was launched into the air by the force of the impact and landed flat on his back, causing him to break his collarbone and crack ribs. He also suffered from severe bruising on his right leg.  “I was walking back to my car, which was parked in Aldi, and was crossing the road when I felt a thud,” he told SWNS. “The next thing I saw was the bumper of a car in front of me. “This roundabout is very dangerous, it always has been. The driver cut the corner and didn’t see me.” Heart-stopping surveillance footage shows Jauncey halfway across the street when the black car hit him, sending him flying feet-first and scattering his belongings across the road and sidewalk.  The car’s occupants quickly stopped the car and rushed over to him, as did several other bystanders.  While the octogenarian laid in shock on the ground and was “not able to move,” his Apple Watch dialed 999 for him after detecting the impact from the crash, according to SWNS.  “The watch detected a fall and asked if I wanted to call the emergency services,” he told the British news source. “I could cancel the request by pressing a button on the side of the phone but I left it and as a result, the phone called 999.” It sent his location to emergency services and paramedics and police arrived several minutes later. They rushed the 82-year-old to Russell’s Hall Hospital, where he was treated for his injuries and spent a week laid up from his “life-changing injuries.”  The retired bookkeeper, who has since returned home, got the watch for Christmas and said the device “saved my life.”  “The modern technology and the capabilities we have are just incredible,” he said.  Whether he had the watch or not, Jauncey would have gotten the help he needed as three off-duty nurses quickly ran over to him after his fall and put him in a comfortable position while they waited for the ambulance.  “There were lots of people who came over to help which really put me at ease,” the Brit said.

Apple defends parts pairing as Oregon mulls right-to-repair bill,2024-02-09T21:34:28+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/apple-defends-parts-pairing-as-oregon-mulls-right-to-repair-bill/,"Oregon may soon become the latest state to pass right-to-repair legislation. Last month, Google lent its support in an open letter, calling Senate Bill 1596 “a compelling model for other states to follow.” The bill, sponsored by a sextet of state senators and representatives, was inspired in part by California SB 244, which Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law in October. Apple openly supported that bill — a rare endorsement from a tech giant that loves playing it close to the vest. Cupertino is, however, less enthusiastic about certain inclusions in the Oregon legislation that were absent from the California law. “Apple agrees with the vast majority of Senate Bill 1596,” John Perry, Apple senior manager, Secure System Design, said in a testimony to state lawmakers this week. “I have met with Senator [Janeen] Sollman several times, and appreciate her willingness to engage in an open dialogue. Senate Bill 1596 is a step forward in making sure that the people of Oregon, myself included, can get their devices repaired easily and cost effectively.” Apple’s major sticking point with the proposed legislation centers around a policy known as “parts paring.” Both iFixit and PIRG (Public Interest Research Group) has criticized the policy, which requires the use of first-party components during the repair process. PIRG, which petitioned the FTC for a ban on the practice late last year, has called it “one of the most pernicious obstacles to right to repair.” Apple, in turn, has staunchly defended the practice, insisting that the use of some third-party parts could present a security issue for users. T “It is our belief that the bill’s current language around parts pairing will undermine the security, safety, and privacy of Oregonians by forcing device manufacturers to allow the use of parts of unknown origin in consumer devices,” said Perry. “It’s important to understand why Apple and other smartphone manufacturers use parts pairing. It’s not to make repair more difficult. It is, in fact, to make access to repair easier while also making sure your device — and the data stored on it — remain secure. Parts pairing also helps ensure your device’s optimal performance and the safe operation of critical components like the battery, after a repair.” Not long after the California bill was passed, iFixit highlighted “seven iPhone parts can trigger issues during repairs” in a New York Times piece. That figure was more than double the three that were identified in 2017 and marked a rise of “about 20% a year since 2016, when only one repair caused a problem.” Apple does some support third-party replacement parts, like batteries and display, though these will often limit certain functionality. The paper continues: “New batteries can trigger warning messages, replacement screens can disable a phone’s brightness settings, and substitute selfie cameras can malfunction.” The element of the bill singled out by Apple reads, in part: An original equipment manufacturer shall m...",-2

For the longest time, Apple's MacBook lineup was in a bit of disarray. Choosing the right model primarily boiled down to budget and display preference, but if you wanted a larger screen, you'd have to pay up for a Pro model, even if the extra power and ports were unnecessary. For most user applications, it's overkill. Also: M3 MacBook Air (2024) review: Benchmark results of Apple's AI laptop may surprise you That's why the 15-inch MacBook Air changes everything and has made my job so much easier. Apple's large-screen MacBook is ultraportable, will satisfy anyone's content-consuming heart, and somehow costs just $100 more than its smaller, older predecessor. While the M2 model featured in this article is no longer the newest offering from Apple -- there's now an M3 variant in town -- it looks nearly identical to its successor, has the same 18-hour battery life rating, and is only missing two features (dual-monitor support and Wi-Fi 6E), chipsets aside.

Masked thief arrested after allegedly being filmed brazenly stealing 50 iPhones on display in California Apple store,2024-02-09T20:07:35+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/09/news/masked-thief-captured-after-stealing-tableful-of-apple-products-on-display/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 A California man was arrested on Wednesday night in connection with a theft from an Apple Store in Berkeley, in which he is allegedly seen on video snatching display devices before walking past a police vehicle and walking to a getaway car. Emeryville Police Department detectives arrested 22-year-old Tyler Mims of Berkeley for his involvement in the theft, and charged him with burglary, grand theft and other crimes. On Monday, officers with the department were dispatched to the scene after a caller reported the crime and said the suspect fled with 50 iPhones, with a total value of $49,230. A masked man, later alleged to be Mims, was wearing all black clothing and seen in the video going from table to table at about 10:30 a.m. on Feb. 5, 2024, ripping phones from their display and placing them into his pockets. During the nearly 45-second video, the thief takes dozens of phones, which cost hundreds of dollars each. Witnesses stood by and watched, and the person recording the video followed closely behind the individual as he exited the store and brushed against a police cruiser before getting into a black Hyundai. The video made the rounds on social media the next day. Since Jan. 19, the department has responded to four grand thefts from the Apple Store in town. After the first incident, detectives began working with nearby agencies with similar thefts, identifying the thefts as organized retail crimes. The department announced Thursday that on Wednesday night, a joint collaboration between its detectives and the Berkeley Police Department and California Highway Patrol resulted in three arrests associated with a theft at the Apple Store in Berkeley that happened earlier that morning. Mims was one of the individuals arrested, police said, and was the person depicted in the video from the Emeryville Apple Store. Mims was booked into jail and charged with three counts each of conspiracy to commit a crime, burglary, grand theft and organized retail theft. The video garnered more than 10 million views on TikTok and X, in total, as of Thursday morning. According to the E’Ville Eye, the Apple Store in the video was closed for several months last year but reopened in January. Advertisement",-2
The era of face-wearable computers,2024-02-09T20:05:26+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/the-era-of-face-wearable-computers/,"Welcome to Startups Weekly — your weekly recap of everything you can’t miss from the world of startups. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday. Holy hell, how is it Friday again? I feel like I wrote one of these newsletters just yesterday. There’s been a ton of exciting movement in the world of startups, though: Some highs, some lows, some drama, and some fun new trends. My big contribution this week was a deep dive into the world of crowdfunding — and whether you should use it to raise money for your startup. Okay, what else happened this week . . . Image Credits: Cory Green/Yahoo Image Credits: Cory Green/Yahoo Okay, so my newsletter is called “Startups Weekly,” but I want to dedicate a chunk of it to Apple. Why? Because, as I wrote last year, I think Apple’s Vision Pro is going to be a huge game changer for startups. We’ve finally had our mittens on Apple’s face-wearable computer. And, what can we say, it’s pretty astonishing. Brian spent an hour with the Apple Vision Pro back in January, and then blogged his little heart out as the Vision Pro finally arrived at his house, in a fascinating (and often hilarious) series of posts covering Day One and Day Two, and an in-depth review that concludes that it’s the best consumer headset out there, where he hopes that the current experience will feel antiquated a generation or two down the road. Although, there’s a powerful use case right now, in the form of immersive mindfulness. There’s an opportunity here, though, especially in the enterprise. 600 apps at your fingertips: Developers are rapidly preparing over 600 new apps and games, joining over 1 million iOS and iPadOS compatible apps. This surge in app development flies in the face of concerns about developer interest due to Apple’s controversial compliance with the EU’s Digital Markets Act. No YouTube app: With the release of the Apple Vision Pro headset, a third-party developer steps in to fill the YouTube app gap with Juno, a $5 one-time purchase app that leverages YouTube’s embed API for a native experience. The app offers features like resizable windows and playback controls, with plans for further enhancements. Reasons to be excited: Lauren and Ivan collected some of the visionOS apps from smaller developers that users can try out when their headset arrives. Image Credits: Getty Images/pkfawcett Image Credits: Getty Images/pkfawcett In a world where tossing food into landfills seems as American as apple pie, startups are popping up like mushrooms to tackle the absurdity of food waste. Enter ProducePay, which decided that enough was enough. With a mission that honestly sounds more like a superhero’s vow than a business plan, ProducePay aims to wrangle the chaos of the fresh produce supply chain into submission. Armed with a hefty $38 million from its latest funding round, it’s set to take its crusade global. Because, really, in the face of a planet where throwing food away is a pastime, what’s a few million dollars among friends? H...",0

An incredible health feature is coming to the Samsung Galaxy Watch,2024-02-09T19:14:58+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-fda-approval-news/,"Samsung has once again beaten the Apple Watch to a crucial piece of health-centric smartwatch tech. The company says it has received U.S.Food and Drug Administration approval for offering sleep apnea detection on its Galaxy Watch smartwatch lineup. But before we get into the benefits of the feature, there are a couple of disappointing updates here. First, the feature will only be rolled out via a software update in the third quarter of 2024, which means you will have to wait until July, at the very least, for sleep apnea detection to appear on your Galaxy smartwatch. Second, the availability will vary by market, as well as by the model number of the smartwatches. Samsung hasn’t specified exactly which Galaxy Watch trims will be getting the promised update, but the Galaxy Watch 6 and Galaxy Watch 6 Classic should be safe candidates. With the disappointing bits out of the way, sleep apnea detection is a notable feature to offer via a smartwatch. According to the National Institutes of Health, sleep apnea, a prevalent disorder, involves repeated interruptions in breathing during sleep. The most frequent form, obstructive sleep apnea, occurs when the upper airway is repeatedly blocked, diminishing or halting airflow as you sleep. Central sleep apnea, on the other hand, arises when the brain fails to transmit the necessary signals for breathing. If not addressed, sleep apnea can elevate the likelihood of various health issues, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of headaches. However, numerous individuals with sleep apnea remain unaware of their condition, as per experts at Johns Hopkins Medicine. Numerous research findings indicate a link between sleep apnea and various health issues, including Type 2 diabetes, strokes, heart attacks, and a reduced life span. Obesity, which is frequently observed in individuals with sleep apnea, significantly raises the likelihood of experiencing diabetes, stroke, and heart attacks. There is also evidence pointing to a direct connection between sleep apnea and the onset of diabetes. Depending on the severity and related body system complications, sleep apnea requires proper consultation with a certified medical expert. Samsung’s implementation of sleep apnea detection on its Galaxy smartwatches will only be available for users who are 22 years of age or older. It will require them to sleep wearing the smartwatch for two days in order to collect the data and detect problematic sleep behavior. It seems that by the time this feature starts rolling out, Apple will also have it ready. Reports suggest that Apple is eyeing sleep apnea detection, as well as blood glucose level monitoring, for the 10th-gen Apple Watch set to arrive later this year. We’ve all heard of Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri, but what’s all the fuss about this Bixby character? Yet another voice assistant that’s built into smartphones and tablets, Bixby is Samsung’s virtual assistant. If you own something wi...",-1

Apple eyes business as a prime market for the Apple Vision Pro,2024-02-09T17:51:16+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/09/apple-eyes-business-as-a-prime-market-for-the-apple-vision-pro/,"For years, we’ve been hearing about virtual and augmented reality use cases in business around manufacturing, field service and product design, but for the most part, the notion has failed to take hold in a big way. The question now is whether the Apple Vision Pro (AVP), released last week with much ballyhoo, will move the needle at all when it comes to shifting these kinds of devices into the enterprise mainstream. While most people use terms like “augmented reality,” “virtual reality” or even “metaverse” (thanks, Meta), Apple prefers to define the genre in its own terms, referring to the Apple Vision Pro as spatial computing or mixed reality. In its typical fashion, Apple is trying to define a new category. Whatever you call it, the company certainly sees the AVP as a business device alongside its more obvious consumer use cases around gaming, media consumption and good old-fashioned web surfing. Certainly it has the potential to transform the online shopping experience. On Apple’s quarterly earnings call with analysts earlier this month, CEO Tim Cook emphasized that he was seeing lots of interest in the enterprise. “Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees,” Cook said. Notice that reference to spatial computing. Cook cited ideas for business like everyday productivity, collaborative product design and immersive training. The ability to have a so-called infinite desktop is key to the productivity piece: Users can open multiple programs and move them around a huge palette that gives new meaning to extra screen real estate. Whether these devices are good for content creation, however, remains an open question. With 600 apps announced last week, and more expected over time, the Apple Vision Pro lets people access the same apps that they are used to using on macOS and iOS, but tuned to the visual experience of the device. To select an app, users simply gaze at the icon in a similar interface as Apple’s other apps, like Safari, Photos, Messages and Mail. As the gaze focuses on the icon, it lights up and users pinch a finger and thumb together to select it. The Apple Vision Pro sports a familiar-looking interface. Image Credits: Apple The Apple Vision Pro sports a familiar-looking interface. Image Credits: Apple One of the big differences between this and earlier devices is that even though it goes over your eyes, you can see through it. Apple deliberately designed it that way, letting the user see the world, and other people see the user’s eyes, so there wasn’t as much separation between the two. The company believes that will alter the experience and perhaps generate new use cases. Steve Sinclair, who is part of worldwide product marketing for Apple Vision Pro, says the company sees the device as an opportunity to explore new...",3

Why Aren't More People Watching 'For All Mankind'?,2024-02-09T17:00:00+00:00,https://www.wired.com/2024/02/geeks-guide-for-all-mankind-se-4/,"Visit WIRED Photo for our unfiltered take on photography, photographers, and photographic journalism wrd.cm/1IEnjUH 

Slide:  1 / of  1.

Caption: For All Mankind is currently in its fourth season on Apple TV+.Apple TV+  The science fiction series For All Mankind, which recently wrapped up its fourth season on Apple TV+, explores an alternate timeline in which the United States and the Soviet Union establish a Mars colony in the 1990s. Science fiction editor John Joseph Adams was impressed with the series’ quality and ambition. “It’s a fantastic show,” Adams says in Episode 560 of the Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy podcast. “It’s definitely one of the best science fiction shows ever, and everyone should definitely watch it.” Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy host David Barr Kirtley agrees that For All Mankind is a first-rate work of science fiction. “It’s one of the only shows on television that presents the idea that the future could be better, and humanity could progress, that competence and intellect and trying to make the world a better place could actually work, and could actually have a positive impact,” he says. For All Mankind has received strong reviews, but so far the show hasn’t attracted the kind of audience it deserves. Screenwriter Rafael Jordan thinks the show’s innovative concept—an alternate history story that unfolds over decades—might be a bit too challenging to communicate to potential viewers. “There seems to be a lack of awareness about what the show is exactly,” he says. “I’ll admit I was late to the show. I don’t think I started watching until Season 2, because I didn’t really realize what it was.” Writer Sara Lynn Michener hopes the show attracts enough viewers to continue through its planned seven-season arc. “A lot is asked of the viewers in this show, and I actually really like that,” she says. “But it also causes me to be concerned that we’re not going to get the seven seasons that we deserve.” Listen to the complete interview with John Joseph Adams, Rafael Jordan, and Sara Lynn Michener in Episode 560 of Geek’s Guide to the Galaxy (above). And check out some highlights from the discussion below. Sara Lynn Michener on Dev Ayesa: They had so many options in terms of “let’s explore the tech bro.” They could have gone the Silicon Valley method, they could have made it this ridiculous character, they could have made it an obviously evil character. But they made it a minority character who has a genuinely fascinating backstory and a genuinely fascinating character. He exudes confidence and peace and wisdom, in this really scary way. So there are scary aspects to the character, for sure, and you’re kind of wondering all the time, “Is he evil or is he good?” … And the result is that this feels like a much more normal, much more realistic character. John Joseph Adams on Seasons 3 and 4: I feel like Seasons 1 and 2 were largely perfect, and I really struggled to come up with criticisms, but with Seasons 3 and 4 I definitely foun...",2

Best dressed celebrities at New York Fashion Week AW24,2024-02-09T16:45:40+00:00,https://www.hellomagazine.com/hfm/fashion-trends/513120/nyfw-best-dressed-celebrities-aw24/,"Subscribe Fashion month AW24 has officially kicked off in New York and we couldn't be more thrilled (shoutout to all the fashion assistants slogging away at this time of year). Twice a year, celebrities bring a slew of brand-new, totally unexpected looks to give us fresh fashion inspo from this moment forward, and we also get a taste of which trends from previous seasons have cemented their place for the next. Already this year, Paris Couture Week brought a new hair style debuted by Zendaya , Kylie Jenner and Stormi's fashion week debut and JLo gave 'Mob Wife' a couture makeover, whilst on the quaint streets of Copenhagen, Mia Regan revived the culottes, Stella Maxwell nailed cowgirlcore chic in fringed boots and Alana Hadid made a case for the return of the quilted jacket. The celebrities on the sartorial sidelines in the Big Apple are already providing top-notch looks. So, let the impeccably styled stars serve up all the inspiration you need for the upcoming spring season that we're desperately manifesting into existence. Take a look at which famous faces were the best-dressed on the front row at New York Fashion Week Autumn/Winter 2024… The Queer Eye star donned a full Thom Browne look, complete with a pleated skirt and knee-high socks to attend the Thom Browne show.  The OG fashion blogger Leandra Medine was seen wearing a tan faux fur trim coat outside the Bevza show. Janet Jackson attended the Thom Browne show in a full Thom Browne look complete with pigtails and oversized hoop earrings.  As per usual, Blake Lively made an entrance, wearing a giraffe print mini skirt and matching trench to the Michael Kors show.  Nina Dobrev wore the cutest black mini dress made from tiny flowers to the Michael Kors show. As we all know by now, Beyoncè is in her cowgirlcore era and we aren't mad. Donning an embellished grey jumpsuit, thigh-high boots, sunglasses and a cowboy hat the star attended the Luar show. Purple might not be everyone's colour but it sure is Nicky Hilton's. The star wore a pair of twinkling sequin trousers and a purple turtleneck to attend the Michael Kors show. Sporting a longline black tuxedo coat, a white strapless dress, black leather gloves and heels, actress Naomi Watts attended the Khaite show looking like a monochromatic vision.  Rachel Zoe attended the Carolina Herrera show in a two-piece suit from the brand, a white fur coat and a red bag. Gisele Bündchen proved her supermodel status en route to the Frame Spring 2024 Campaign Celebration Dinner. The model wore an all-black leather ensemble consisting of knee-high boots, a mini skirt and a trench coat. Model and Muse Barbara Palvin chose a striking twinkling jacket and mini dress combo in midnight blue to attend the Tory Burch show. AnnaSophia Robb donned opaque knee-high socks and metallic silver shoes for the Tory Burch show. She paired her coquette core socks with a white coat and mini dress.

"‘Masters Of The Air’ Star Callum Turner On The ‘Grueling,’ ‘Mind-Blowing’ Apple TV+ Series",2024-02-09T16:39:33+00:00,https://uproxx.com/tv/masters-of-the-air-callum-turner-interview/,"Just a month into 2024 and Callum Turner is already having one hell of a year. The 33-year-old British actor can count the George Clooney-directed sports drama The Boys in the Boat and the Steven Spielberg-produced World War II series, Masters of the Air, amongst his recent on-screen credits. Both roles have earned him praise from critics, thrusting him into the spotlight with Hollywood “It” boys of the moment like Austin Butler and Barry Keoghan – who, coincidentally, serve as his co-stars on the Apple TV+ show. And, in what may be the most definitive piece of evidence concerning the question of whether Turner has “made it,” he’s now fielding rumors during red carpet walks that he’s in the running to become the next James Bond. (He’s not, that he knows of.) With his role as Major John “Bucky” Eagan in the Spielberg and Tom Hanks-backed Band of Brothers off-shoot, Turner trades on his physicality, vibrating with barely-contained rage in every scene he’s in. The high-flying bomber pilot is reckless, antagonistic, and ill-equipped to weather the emotional brunt of war, but his heroics in the air and his care for his men weigh the scales. Uproxx chatted with Turner about his personal connection to the big-budget war series, being a loose cannon on set, and trying to lose his American accent once filming was done.  Was a World War II movie near the top of your acting bucket list?  Not anymore, but it was, for sure. The truth is that my granddad went to war when he was 16 years old, and I grew up on the stories that people would tell about him. I’ve always been fascinated by this moment in history and how miraculously the Allies managed to win and how close we came so many times to losing — how many mistakes got made and how fragile life is. I guess that’s what it represents, how lucky we are that we live in this time. I didn’t know about the Eighth Air Force and I didn’t know about the 100th, and I’m just very grateful that I get to be a part of this story, to shine a light on their legacy. I always thought it would be the infantrymen who had the toughest time down there on the ground, but actually, it was these guys. They would fly into the face of adversity, into hell, and lose men left, right, and center. What’s exceptional about our show is that we experience that. We go up with them and we see that hell, and we see that pain and we see how outrageous it is, what they had to put themselves through. Only 23% of them make it, which is such a low number. It just blows my mind. And we watch them deal with grief and trauma, the effect that has on their mind, body, and soul. Your The Boys In The Boat role required a lot from you physically. Did this show challenge you in a similar way? Absolutely. It’s tight in those planes, it really is. And you’ve got a lot of gear on. You’ve got your flak vest, you’ve got your life jacket, you’ve got your parachute rig. I’m also 6’2″, which is a lot bigger than John Egan. He was wafer thin and I’ve got broad shoulde...",0
"Apple improves iCloud for Windows, kills iTunes",2024-02-09T16:35:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3712880/apple-improves-icloud-for-windows-kills-itunes.html#tk.rss_all,"
				Among the changes to the widely used application are support for physical security keys, dark mode, and an improved user interface.			  If you use Windows for work and an iPhone for everything else, you should know that Apple has changed iCloud for Windows and no longer offers iTunes for the platform —  though none of your media purchases have disappeared. Apple has redesigned the iCloud for Windows application, giving it a more modern look that’s easier to navigate with Photos, iCloud Drive, Passwords, Bookmarks and Calendars/Contacts all easy to access in a click. It’s also easy to check how much storage you have in use. Beyond the facelift, the software is now a little easier to set up and install and provides better insights into how files and other data are syncing. The latter means you can check whether items are in the process of syncing, and when a sync operation last took place. You can also check service status — all from within the iCloud app front page. That means Windows users can monitor the sync status of photos, contacts, and of course any work-related documents that might be stored in iCloud Drive. Users might also notice that photos syncing has gotten faster and and experience better syncing with Microsoft Outlook. Apple notes that contact and calendar syncing problems with Outlook have been resolved, though Windows 11 22H2 is required. There are some brand new enhancements, including support for physical security keys and dark mode. Users can also track all the devices (Apple and non-Apple) they have signed into iCloud through the Accounts Details page. To summarize the improvements: It might seem ironic to note that iCloud for Windows is potentially one of Apple’s most widely used applications. That is because some market share estimates suggest just a quarter of those 1 billion+ iPhones in use today are also running Macs, leaving millions of people on Windows PCs. That’s a large number of potential users of Apple’s updated applications, which also means the replacement of iTunes with standalone Apple Music and Apple TV apps is likely to impact those people, too. If you use physical security keys to protect your Apple ID, you can now also use those keys with Windows, as explained by Apple here. The company introduced support for FIDO-certified hardware keys in 2023. These provide additional security, particularly for those needing additional protection from targeted attacks. Learn how and why to use these keys to protect your Apple ID here. Apple replaced iTunes on Macs with standalone Music and TV apps with macOS Catalina in 2019. In a process it announced in 2022, the company has now brought Windows users into line with that decision, introducing standalone Music and TV apps for that platform. All existing purchased content will be available from within those apps, and if you subscribe to the company’s media services, you can access those, too. Apple has also introduced a new version of the Apple Devices app, which lets...",2

New York Yankees Set for World Series Challenge? Off-Season Additions Come into Question With Spring Training Days Away,2024-02-09T16:00:04+00:00,https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-new-york-yankees-set-for-world-series-challenge-off-season-additions-come-into-question-with-spring-training-days-away/,"Latest NBA NFL NASCAR Golf Tennis ES Fancast Latest NBA NFL NASCAR Golf Tennis ES Fancast Home MLB Follow Us An injured New York Yankees limped into the off-season in 2023 with a disappointing finish. Their dire need for improvement has not been a secret. To help them save the day, they can count on the big wallet they carry in the Big Apple. However, would their spending actually translate into success? As spring training approaches, the answer remains complex.  There once was the ‘YamaSoto’ dream. But only half of it could turn into a reality with MLB’s young phenom, Juan Soto, landing in pinstripes. However, with him came Alex Verdugo and Trent Grisham, all ready to bolster the outfield. And Marcus Stroman is sworn to bring stability to the rotation. Chalk up some serious wins for Brian Cashman, but that does not rule out some major ‘what ifs’ in the air. ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Yes, the Bronx Bombers appear to be ready for 2024. But ‘appear’ is the caveat here. Last year’s injury-plagued season is not one to forget. Though it was massively embarrassing, it calls for avoiding repeating a similar situation. Aaron Boone is leading the troop, his words reassuring. As per MLB.com, he said, “If we couple it with reasonable health around [Soto] and some guys returning to form, then it’s got a chance to be a special lineup”. But it’s easier said than done, isn’t it?  April 06, 2024 08:00 PM EDT April 06, 2024 04:00 PM EDT April 06, 2024 03:00 PM EDT April 04, 2024 05:50 PM EDT July 07, 2023 04:11 PM EDT Get instantly notified of the hottest MLB stories via Google!

On the other, the aspect of health still remains in question. Given the current situation, one has to take this with a pinch of salt. But what about the ones who didn’t fare as expected in 2023?  There have been reports that Giancarlo Stanton has changed his approach to training. That’s hopeful, but his history leaves a scar of caution in the fans’ optimism. That said, one must look at bounce backs. Players like DJ LeMahieu and Anthony Rizzo, who underwhelmed last season, acknowledge the importance of bouncing back in 2024.  Watch This Story:  Ranking the Top 5 Best Lineups in Baseball ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad The Yanks did not have any loud offseason moves except the one with Juan Soto.

"Robocalls banned by the FCC, Did The Simpsons predict Apple Vision Pro too?",2024-02-09T15:59:37+00:00,https://www.shinyshiny.tv/2024/02/robocalls-banned-by-the-fcc-did-the-simpsons-predict-apple-vision-pro-too.html,"
The federal agency that regulates communication in the US has made robocalls that use AI-generated voices illegal. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced the move on Thursday, saying it will take effect immediately. It gives the state power to prosecute any bad actors behind these calls, the FCC said. It comes amid a rise in robocalls that have mimicked the voices of celebrities and political candidates. “Bad actors are using AI-generated voices in unsolicited robocalls to extort vulnerable family members, imitate celebrities, and misinform voters,” said FCC chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel in a statement on Thursday. BBC  Google has rebranded its Bard AI chatbot as Gemini as the tech giant announced a new mobile app and a more powerful AI tool, Gemini Advanced. From Thursday, a Gemini app will launch on Android for the first time, and the chatbot will be made available inside the official Google app on Apple’s iOS. In a major update to the firm’s AI offerings, the mobile app upgrades will launch alongside a new subscription-based service called Gemini Advanced. Independent  For months, Tom has been left in limbo by Amazon. The money locked in his account has continued to climb – with hundreds of thousands of pounds left inaccessible. The tech giant has been criticised for withholding payments from its sellers as it conducts strict new VAT checks, required under UK laws. In the process, hundreds – if not thousands – of small businesses have suddenly been plunged into a cash flow crisis. Telegraph  Everyone loves The Simpsons, how could you not? While it’s always been a popular show, for the past few years it’s become…well kinda creepy as the show seems to foreshadow the future with an eerie accuracy. It’s freaking us out at this point. In 2016, an episode titled ‘Friends and Family’ was aired, which almost gave a Black Mirror feel to the cartoon, showing Homer and Marge lying in bed while using virtual reality headsets, which soon catches on to the whole of Springfield. And many think that the tech has an uncanny resemblance to the new Apple Vision Pro. Unilad  Users of Ring video doorbells have reacted angrily to a huge price hike set to be introduced in March. After buying the devices, customers can pay a subscription to store footage on the cloud, download clips and get discounted products. That subscription is going up 43%, from £34.99 to £49.99 per device, per year, for basic plan customers. The firm, which is owned by Amazon, insisted it still provided “some of the best value in the industry.” Tech Digest  Honor took its time in launching the Magic V2 globally, and as a result, the phone is running last year’s silicon and Android 13. It also misses out on an IP rating and wireless charging, and the software doesn’t have the same level of polish as its rivals. But all of these issues fade into the background once you actually start using the foldable. The Magic V2 is the thinnest foldable available today, and using it is transf...",0
How to protect against cyberthreats with Apple’s rapid security response,2024-02-09T15:42:15+00:00,https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/how-to-protect-against-cyberthreats-apple-rapid-security-response-cybersecurity-jamf,"
9 Feb 2024  Image: © Aleksei/Stock.adobe.com Jamf’s Dr Michael Covington gives his top tips for integrating Apple’s new rapid patching system into your cybersecurity and device management strategy. The cyberthreat landscape is constantly evolving, with nearly 29,000 new common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) reported last year alone. The clock is continually ticking for researchers, vendors and businesses to find and patch the weaknesses before threat actors can exploit them. Apple has long enjoyed a reputation for being ‘more secure’ than other operating systems, partially because of platform features like the hardware-reinforced Secure Enclave, but also because of development practices and operating system design choices. However, security flaws still find their way into Apple’s operating systems, causing critical concerns for millions of users and organisations that have adopted one of Apple’s devices for critical work. Given the growing need and demand for more timely security-related bug fixing, the tech giant opted to introduce a new patching system last year. Historically, Apple’s approach to software updates bundled security fixes with feature roll-outs in a somewhat predictable pattern. However, the Rapid Security Response (RSR) process allows security fixes to be released independently, without a more feature-rich software update. So, what does this mean for organisations, and how can they best embrace the new approach? While systematic, Apple’s traditional patching system often meant that urgent security patches were tethered to the rhythm of broader updates. But the digital threat landscape waits for no one. The new separation of critical security updates from feature enhancements and new capabilities helps to ensure that security fixes are prioritised, not just in development and testing, but in delivery to users. Additionally, Apple’s update process now highlights the critical nature of rapid security responses, allowing users and organisations to install them with some urgency upon release. As the name suggests, speed is the focus of the new strategy, but it should also lead to a more focused and precise approach to patching. However, whilst Apple is changing how security patches are issued, it will still be up to individual users or organisations to apply them. Many firms are still falling short on this, and we’ve found that as many as one in every five devices are running on operating systems that are not up to date. All enterprises using Apple products should ensure they have a solid patching process and that their approach is aligned with the RSR strategy. As with all other forms of security patching, applying updates is essential for users and businesses to realise the benefits of the RSR process. How this is achieved will look different for every organisation based on their mix of users, devices and applications, uptime tolerances for different users and overall risk tolerance. Critical updates released through the new ...",2

When Apple first revealed the Vision Pro, I was intrigued. But then, like many others, I saw the pricing and quickly looked away. At a starting cost of $3,500, I didn't even bat an eye and went back to focusing on wearables and other mobile technology that would help optimize my life. Review: Apple Vision Pro: Fascinating, flawed, and needs to fix 5 things After reading the early thoughts of my ZDNET colleagues, Jason and Kerry, and watching several videos of people using it after launch day, I thought maybe I should take the plunge on the next-gen headset. Perhaps one of the most expensive gadgets from Apple can improve my productivity and efficiency at work.  I should mention now that I bought my first Apple computer in 1989, slept outside of an AT&T store in the rain for the first iPhone, and I consider myself an early adopter of technology. Despite missing out on Vision Pro pre-orders, I still kept an eye out for daily stock updates and eventually picked one up at my local mall store earlier this week.  With my local sales tax, the 512GB model, with the $199 travel case, totaled just under $4,300. Thus, a high bar was set by Apple to prove to me that the Vision Pro is indeed worth the investment. I've now used the headset for three days, including using it on my commuter train and in the office. Here are my thoughts, as an engineer and digital nomad. In my day job, I serve as a professional naval architect, and at this stage in my 30-year career, I develop stability calculations, review design drawings, write reports and proposals, meet with clients on Tea...",1

The pair, whose previous projects include Malcolm X, He Got Game and Inside Man, will begin filming the adaptation in March. The original film is based on Ed McBain’s novel King’s Ransom and stars Toshiro Mifune as a wealthy man who is forced to pay the ransom money for his employee’s kidnapped son. In 2008, it was reported that Martin Scorsese would be developing a remake of the story, but the project never went ahead. Lee has previously spoken about his admiration for Kurosawa, claiming that his 1986 comedy She’s Gotta Have It was influenced by the Japanese director’s 1950 drama Rashomon. The remake of High And Low will be released in cinemas by A24 before heading to Apple TV+ (as reported by The Guardian). Director Spike Lee CREDIT: Marc Piasecki/FilmMagic Alan Fox, a former college basketball player and model turned playwright, will write the script. Fox is also currently working on the script for Queens Of The Stoned Age, about a model who becomes a weed dealer. Dakota Johnson is reportedly in talks to star. Washington is next set to appear alongside Paul Mescal in Ridley Scott’s Gladiator 2. The actor last worked with Lee in the 2006 thriller Inside Man. Elsewhere, Washington has been cast as the ancient Carthaginian general Hannibal in a biopic from Gladiator writer John Logan. The Antione Fuqua film, which will be released on Netflix, will tell the story of the famed military leader who posed the greatest threat to the Roman Republic, leading troops atop elephants over the Alps to attack Rome from the north. News of Washington’s casting sparked controversy in Tunisia, the home country of the military commander, with many complaining about the historical figure being portrayed as A Black African.

If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. It’s not often you see huge savings on Apple’s range of MacBooks, but we’ve spotted a hefty discount on one at Currys that’ll be hard to ignore. The site has currently whacked £290 off the £1989 RRP of a MacBook Pro 14-inch with the M2 Pro chipset, bringing it down to a far more tempting £1699. While this remains a high price, it is excellent value for this very good machine – especially when you consider the 512GB SSD inside. Other specs include 16GB of memory, Apple’s very capable M2 Pro chipset comprising of a 10-core CPU and 16-core GPU, fantastic HDR 14-inch display and various ports, including 3x Thunderbolt USB-C ports and SD card slot.

 The site has currently whacked £290 off the £1989 RRP of a MacBook Pro 14-inch with the M2 Pro chipset, bringing it down to a far more tempting £1699. The display here is particularly standout and one of the biggest reasons to plump for this over the cheaper MacBook Air. Instead of a standard IPS LCD, the Mini LED panel is far closer in quality to an OLED. The Blacks are deep and the brightness levels are fantastic, making this ideal for those who want to create a full HDR workflow. We’ve also been thoroughly impressed with Apple’s own chips and the fantastic performance they offer. This machine is worthy of the Pro moniker, with strong benchmarking results and the ability to run high-end apps like those for video editing and music production. The majority of the earlier bugs we found with Apple’s own chips have mostly been sorted, with app compatibility less of an issue now. We had plenty of positive things to say about this MacBook Pro when we reviewed this very M2 Pro model last year, heaping praise on the ‘stunning screen’ the fantastic performance and the improved design. In the verdict of our review, we said “The MacBook Pro 14-inch (2023) is another fantastic Apple laptop, designed with those who need serious power on the go in mind. The upgrades over the previous version are minimal, but that doesn’t stop this from being one of the best laptops you can buy.

Ex-Apple engineer sentenced to six months in prison for stealing self-driving car tech,2024-02-09T11:05:37+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/ex-apple-engineer-sentenced-to-six-months-in-prison-for-stealing-self-driving-car-tech-110537599.html?src=rss,"Xiaolang Zhang, the former Apple employee who pleaded guilty to stealing information about the development of the company's self-driving vehicle, has been sentenced to 120 days in prison followed by a three-year supervised release. Zhang was arrested back in 2018 at San Jose International Airport just as he was about to board a flight to China. He initially pleaded not guilty until he changed his tune in 2022 and admitted to stealing trade secrets. In addition to serving time behind bars, he also has to pay restitution amounting to $146,984, according to the court document of his sentencing first seen by 9to5Mac. Zhang originally faced up to 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. The former Apple employee worked as a hardware engineer for the company's decade-old autonomous vehicle initiative codenamed Project Titan. Based on Apple's complaint, Zhang transferred a 25-page document containing engineering schematics of a circuit board for the company's self-driving vehicle to his wife's laptop via AirDrop. He also saved a copy of technical manuals that described Apple's prototype to that laptop, in addition to stealing circuit boards and a Linux server from the company's development labs. Zhang resigned from Apple following a paternity leave and a trip to China, telling the iPhone maker that he was going to work in the country for XPeng Motors. That reportedly triggered an investigation, since XPeng is also working on autonomous driving technology, which revealed that Zhang was caught on CCTV taking hardware from Apple's labs and transferring files to his wife's computer. He's expected to surrender himself by June 19, after which he will be sent to a minimum-security facility as close as possible to his home in San Jose, California. Apple's self-driving vehicle has been in the works for a decade, but it has yet to launch a product consumers can buy. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman recently reported that the company changed its plans and is now developing an EV like Tesla's instead of a full-fledged autonomous vehicle. The long-awaited Apple Car is now projected to debut no earlier than 2028. Apple's AirPods Pro (second-generation) are $60 off in a deal on Amazon, bringing the price don to just $190. The AirPods Pro normally cost $250. They come with active noise cancellation, adaptive audio, and personalized spatial audio.

                U.S. AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. – A few weeks after cadets viewed a special pre-screening of the first episode of “Masters of the Air” mini-series, they listened to a lecture from the author who wrote the book that inspired the show.

Dr. Donald Miller’s book “Masters of the Air: America’s Bomber Boys Who Fought the War Against Nazi Germany,” is the source material for Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg’s World War II mini-series. The Apple TV+ series follows U.S. Army Air Forces’ B-17 Flying Fortress crews as they fly missions to targets in Germany in the last two years of World War II.

Sharing a legacy with a new generation of Airmen
When the other installments in the series, “Band of Brothers” and “The Pacific,” were released in 2001 and 2010, the cadets were infants and young children.

“I grew up a big fan of ‘Band of Brothers’ and was really excited about this series,” said Cadet 1st Class Ryan Moore. “We finally got our own show that’s about our heritage, our origin, and the people who paved the way for us and share that legacy.”

Moore said watching the first episode at Arnold Hall with his fellow cadets was inspiring. The opportunity to “pick the author’s brain” about the air crew experiences gave him even more perspective.

The ‘shoulders of giants’
Moore, a Military and Strategic Studies major, will be headed to pilot training after graduation. He was particularly interested in learning about the Airmen who flew dangerous strategic bombing missions into Nazi Germany and said Miller’s lecture on World War II strategic bombing was fascinating. Moore said he realizes the risks and technology today may be different, but the call to serve remains the same.

“Just learning about the attrition rate that they had was sobering because that’s our heritage,” he said. “That is where we are coming from. We are in the position we are because of what they were willing to do. We stand on the shoulders of giants.”

"NYC transportation bigwigs rack up speeding tickets, traffic violations while backing anti-car agenda, congestion pricing",2024-02-17T18:17:10+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/17/us-news/nyc-transportation-honchos-rack-up-speed-camera-tickets/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Two of the Big Apple’s top transportation honchos —  known for talking tough at traffic scofflaws — need speed themselves, data reviewed by The Post reveals.  Department of Transportation Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez and his baby mama Christina Melendez, a top director at the Department of Education, have racked up a staggering 66 traffic violations totaling at least $5,600 in fines the past decade using the same vehicle – including 14 since 2019 for speeding in school safety zones, according to city records.   The chair of the City Council’s Transportation Committee, Councilwoman Selvena Brooks-Powers (D-Queens), has cruised in a family car that racked up 25 tickets over the past 16 months, including 20 for speeding near schools and another for blowing a red light, records show.  It’s unclear how many of the summonses were handed out on Melendez’s Nissan Rogue when Rodriguez was behind the wheel.  As DOT commissioner for the past two years, he’s enjoyed the perk of having a city vehicle that comes with an assigned driver. “Ydanis Rodriquez, who gets chauffeured in a giant SUV, and Selvena Brooks-Powers are prime examples of ‘do as I say, not as I do,'” fumed Councilman Robert Holden (D-Queens). They’re “hypocrites who act as if laws don’t apply to them,” he added.  Other lefty pols with a long history of being speed demons who’ve racked up plenty of traffic violations include Comptroller Brad Lander, Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, and Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine. Rodriguez regularly drove Melendez’s Nissan to work at City Hall when he was a Manhattan councilman — even obtaining a parking placard for it — but he and his former domestic partner, who share two daughters, have since split, according to sources.  The vehicle was slapped with six speeding tickets during the final five months leading up to Rodriguez’s January 2022 appointment by Mayor Adams as DOT commissioner. Since then, the Nissan has received six parking tickets – including two for misusing a parking permit—and was caught speeding in July and November of last year.   On March 2, 2023, the vehicle was slapped with two tickets totaling $160 for illegally parking in a spot in lower Manhattan on Warren Street reserved for state senators and assembly members.  The traffic agent noted in the tickets that the car was flashing a Department of Education parking permit. Melendez works nearby as the DOE’s $195,000-a-year executive director of Family and Community Engagement.  A Post photographer on Thursday spotted Melendez getting into the vehicle, which was illegally parked in a truck loading zone. Rodriguez, who has cheered congestion pricing and speed cameras and has helped promote City Hall’s anti-car agenda, earns $243,171 and now gets a free ride to work in a city vehicle.  He has not driven his ex’s car since being appointed commissioner two years ago...",0
5 Things To Know Before Trading In Your iPhone,2024-02-17T17:45:40+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1516867/things-to-know-before-trading-in-iphone/,"
Have you ever found yourself eyeing the latest iPhone, feeling that unpleasant mix of excitement and guilt? Well, you're not alone. Each year, as Apple releases another device, it's tempting to want to get an upgrade so you can try out and enjoy the new features. But then, there's that nagging reality about how your actions affect the environment — and, let's be honest, your wallet.





Here's the thing: Upgrading doesn't have to be a guilt-inducing experience. When a company such as Apple offers trade-in services, it is its way of saying, ""Let's make your next upgrade easier on your pocket and kinder to the planet.""
So, by trading in your old iPhone, you get to hit two birds with one stone — you buy a new device at a better price, and your old iPhone gets a new lease on life, either in someone else's hands or through recycling if it's seen better days.
Before you take advantage of this service, there are a couple of things to keep in mind to help you make the most out of this deal.

Apple's trade-in service is designed to allow you to exchange your old devices for credit towards a new purchase or an Apple Store Gift Card. However, this service isn't accessible everywhere in the world.





Apple has more than 270 retail locations in the United States, most of which offer in-store and online trade-in options. However, if Apple's trade-in options aren't available where you primarily reside, you might need to look into local options or third-party services that offer similar services.
Many cellular service providers offer their own trade-in programs. And several electronic stores offer trade deals or buyback programs for old devices. This can be a convenient option, especially if you're considering purchasing a new device from the same retailer.
At this point, you might be wondering: Is it better to sell or trade in your old iPhone? Well, either choice has its pros and cons. There are numerous online platforms that specialize in buying used electronics, including Apple p...",2

			Trending:		 The San Bernardino County Museum has unveiled a pop-up exhibit in the lobby of the San Bernardino County Government Center at 385 N. Arrowhead Ave., San Bernardino. The exhibit offers a brief look into the life of U.S. Air Force Capt. Joseph McConnell, a fighter pilot in World War II and the Korean War who died in 1954 in a crash at Edwards Air Force Base. The exhibit includes replica aviator objects, medals and other objects, courtesy of Don Holland, according to a news release. The pop-up exhibit in San Bernardino is an extension of the “Military in the Mojave: A Commanding Presence in the Victor Valley” exhibit that is on display at the Victor Valley Museum in Apple Valley. “The military and those serving and those employed by the military have had a huge impact on our region both economically and culturally,” Jennifer Dickerson, San Bernardino County Museum history curator, said in the news release. The Victor Valley Museum, where the “Military in the Mojave” exhibit is on display, is at 11873 Apple Valley Road, Apple Valley. Admission is $10 for adults, $8 for military and seniors, $7 for students, $5 for children ages 6 to 12 and free for children 5 and younger and for Museum Foundation members.

This iPhone 16 leak suggests a big Apple Vision Pro-inspired camera change is coming,2024-02-17T17:22:38+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96275/this-iphone-16-leak-suggests-big-apple-vision-pro-inspired-camera-change-is-coming/index.html,"The Apple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are not expected to be announced until this coming September but there are already rumors about what the new handsets will have to offer and which features buyers can look forward to. The iPhone 15 and iPHone 15 Plus have only been on sale for a few months, but that was never going to stop the rumors from circulating One of those rumors suggested that Apple would choose to change the layout of the back of the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus to put its two cameras into a vertical orientation. The change would mean ditching the familiar diagonal setup, but it's a switch that is about more than aesthetics and a new leak appears to have confirmed the change is coming. A new part leak by the X leaker Majin Bu appears to show the chassis that the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus cameras will be mounted in and sure enough, they have a vertical orientation. But what makes that so important is the fact that it would put the two cameras in a horizontal orientation when the iPhone is turned on its side - just like the Pro iPhones. The reason for the change is thought to be to add support for capturing spatial videos just like the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. Spatial videos are videos that appear in 3D when viewed on the new Apple Vision Pro, a headset that has been on sale for a couple of weeks and starts at $3,499. Apple's decision to make it easier for people to capture home movies that can then be watched as spatial videos on an Apple Vision Pro makes plenty of sense, and it was always going to happen. There's no reason for Apple to keep this as a Pro-level feature. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are both expected to be announced later this fall alongside the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Previous leaks suggest that the new handsets will gain the iPhone 15 Pro lineup's Action button, while a new Capture Button has also been leaked in previous reports as well. It's important to remember that there is no guarantee that any of this si going to come to fruition of course, and Apple's plans can and do change as products work their way through the development cycle. Whether that will happen in the case of this camera changes remains to be seen but we can expect more leaks in the coming weeks and months.

"The Apple Vision Pro isn't being returned as much as you might think, report hints",2024-02-17T17:03:41+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96274/the-apple-vision-pro-isn-being-returned-as-much-you-might-think-report-hints/index.html,"The Apple Vision Pro has now been on sale for a day beyond the two-week return window that would apply to those who bought the headset on launch day which means that people have had to choose whether or not to hand it back. Priced starting from $3,499 there is no doubt that people are unlikely to keep the Apple Vision Pro unless they are sold on it completely, so it was always going to be interesting to see how many people kept it and how many just bought it for launch day clout on social media. With that in mind, it was interesting to see how many people decided to take their Apple Vision Pro back to the Apple Store before the weekend rolled around while there were plenty of people posting on the X social network, a new report claims that the number of returned headsets isn't as high as you might think. According to an Apple Insider report, Apple Stores haven't seen all that many new headsets returned before that 14-day return window closed. The report cited sources at 24 mostly US East Coast stores when it said that there doesn't appear to be much in the way of returns. It's ""certainly not a cataclysmic flood,"" we're told. The report suggests that the rate at which the Apple Vision Pro is being returned is no higher than that of other Apple products including the iPhone. One source said that there was a checklist to follow for returns to ensure that all of the parts are present and that the packaging is intact - the source reported that they had only had to use it twice in a week. It's easy to imagine why some might have expected the Apple Vision Pro to suffer in terms of returns more than other products given its extremely high asking price of course, but this somewhat anecdotal evidence suggests that might not be the case. The Apple Vision Pro went on sale on February 2 after being announced on June 5 of last year. The price does start at $3,499 but that gets you the 256GB model. Those who want to upgrade to 512GB or 1TB of storage have to pay $200 more for each spec bump, while an additional battery costs $199. The same amount of money sir required to pick up a travel case, too. Apple is already heavily rumored to be working on a new, cheaper Apple Vision Pro but it's impossible to know when that will be released to the public.

Apple TV+’s latest sci-fi thriller, which premieres February 21, only rewards those with plenty of patience. It trots along slowly over eight hour-long episodes, providing a perplexing yet illuminating study of psychological trauma. The show uses an epic scope—the cosmos!—to pin down the nitty-gritty horrors of isolation and grief. At the very least, Constellation deserves merit for its ambitious attempt to balance the contradictory vastness of space with the astronauts’ claustrophobia and inner turmoil. That said, the central suspense is so damn loopy that it can’t fully sustain itself by the end.

Read More 5 / 12 When Ghosts viewers last visited Woodstone B&B, they were faced with a terrifying question: Which of the ghosts had been “sucked off”?

 The Irish actor stars in two historical drama series for Apple TV+, ""Masters of the Air"" and ""Manhunt."" Deputy Eye Editor 
	Anthony Boyle has a theory.  
	“I think I’ve got a face that just looks like it can’t comprehend the internet,” says the Irish actor. “I never get cast in anything after the ’60s.”  
	This spring, Boyle stars in two Apple TV+ series chronicling American history. In the World War II ensemble drama “Masters of the Air,” he stars as Major Harry Crosby, a navigator for the 100th Bomb Group, and in “Manhunt,” he stars as John Wilkes Booth, the stage actor who assassinated Abraham Lincoln in 1865.  
	“I was terrible at history at school, but I keep playing real people from the past,” says Boyle.

	The Belfast-based actor was traveling between time zones with his costars in the lead-up to the premiere of the first episode of “Masters of the Air” in late January. After a short trip to New York, Boyle was headed to Boston to host a screening for the real-life family of his character, which would be followed by a trip to the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. 

	








 
	Boyle had met Crosby’s family a few weeks earlier at the show’s L.A. premiere. “Afterward, one of his sons came to me and said, ‘You know, before we saw it, they said to us, ‘don’t expect to see your father on screen,’” says Boyle. “And he shook my hand and said, ‘I feel like we’ve got dad back.’ I thought, you know what — if the critics don’t like it, then I say, whatever. That meant the world to me. I felt like a million bucks.”

 
	The critics have overwhelmingly lauded the series, describing it as “beautifully rendered” (Variety) and “exhilarating and rousingly inspirational” (Hollywood Reporter). Most tip their hat to the massive scale of the show, which was produced by Hollywood heavyweights Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and serves as a companion to “Greyhound” and “Band of Brothers.” 
	“You could feel it from the ground up that they’re sort of omnipresent, how much care that they put into these things,” says Boyle of the creative team. “Tom Hanks was great personally with advice about not bleeding into solemnity,” he adds. “Because when you speak to these lads [soldiers], they don’t view themselves as heroes — they view themselves as they just went and did the job.” 
	In the leadup to filming, Boyle and the rest of the cast, which includes Austin Butler, Callum Turner and Barry Keoghan, went through boot camp. Boyle credits the experience for helping put them in the mindset of young soldiers preparing for war. “We had to really muck together,” says Boyle.  
	“Seventy-seven percent of the men that went up in the planes didn’t come back. It’s staggering what those men we...",0

			Trending:		 About 17 years ago, Steve Jobs took the stage at a San Francisco convention center and said he was introducing three products: an iPod, a phone and an internet browser. “These are not three separate devices,” he said. “This is one device, and we are calling it iPhone.” At $500, the first iPhone was relatively expensive, but I was eager to dump my mediocre Motorola flip phone and splurge. There were flaws — including sluggish cellular internet speeds. But the iPhone delivered on its promises. Over the past week, I’ve had a very different experience with a new first-generation product from Apple: the Vision Pro, a virtual reality headset that resembles a pair of ski goggles. The $3,500 wearable computer, which was released Friday, uses cameras so you can see the outside world while juggling apps and videos. Apple calls it a “spatial computer” that blends together the physical and digital worlds for people to work, watch movies and play games. Apple declined to provide an early review unit to The New York Times, so I bought a Vision Pro on Friday. (It costs much more than $3,500 with the add-ons that many people will want, including a $200 carrying case, $180 AirPods and $100 prescription lens inserts for people who wear glasses.) After using the headset for about five days, I’m unconvinced that people will get much value from it. The device feels less polished than past first-generation Apple products I’ve used. It’s not better for doing work than a computer, and the games I’ve tried so far aren’t fun, which makes it difficult to recommend. An important feature — the ability to place video calls with a humanlike digital avatar that resembles the wearer — terrified children during a family FaceTime call. The headset is superb at delivering on one of its promises: playing video, including high-definition movies and your own recordings in 3D that let you immerse yourself in past memories, which is both eerie and cool. In the past decade, companies such as Meta, HTC and Sony have struggled mightily to sell headsets to mainstream consumers because their products were cumbersome to wear, their apps were limited and they looked uncool. The Vision Pro has a superior user interface, better picture quality, more apps and higher computing power than other headsets. But it’s slightly heavier than Meta’s cheaper Quest headsets, and it plugs into an external battery pack that lasts only two hours. The ski-goggle aesthetic of the Apple product looks better than the bulky plastic headset visors of the past. But the videos posted by early adopters walking around outside with the headset — men I call Vision Bros — confirm that people still look ridiculous wearing tech goggles, even when they are designed by Apple. The Vision Pro is miles ahead of other headsets I’ve tested in making an immersive 3D interface simple for users to contr...",-2

Why this picture has left Aussies confused after Fishbowl founders launch their business in New York,2024-02-17T09:28:07+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13094441/Fishbowl-Sydney-Melbourne-New-York-Thisbowl.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By Brett Lackey For Daily Mail Australia and Duncan Evans For Nca Newswire   Published:  09:28, 17 February 2024   |  Updated:  09:37, 17 February 2024      3 View  comments  Aussies living in the US have been left confused after a new restaurant popped up in New York that bears a remarkable resemblance to a popular Australian food outlet. Expats and visitors living in The Big Apple took to social media after they spotted some signage in New York's NoHo that resembles the restaurant Fishbowl with a slightly altered name. 'Surely this is Fishbowl but they couldn't just name it Fishbowl. I really hope it is, I've missed it,' one fan said in a clip shared on social media. Indeed rather than a knock-off, the company's young founders have confirmed they are taking their Asian-inspired salad and protein bowl takeaway business global. The group is ramping up to open their first outlet off Australian shores but have had to do so  under the name Thisbowl in the US. Fishbowl's first store in the US will be in Manhattan's NoHo. Picture: Supplied Fishbowl founders Nathan Dalah, Nic Pestalozzi, and Casper Ettelson at the Parramatta eatery. Picture: Nikki To The Fishbowl founders have revealed how they went from being university students to the owners of a brand worth millions (pictured is a Japanese-style salad from the eatery) The New York store is set to open in mid-2024 as the company's three founders, who are friends from University, set their sights on the massive US market. Nic Pestalozzi, one of three founders, said the company wanted to launch big in the US by cracking the New York market. 'New York is the absolute Mecca of retail in the world,' he said. 'We debated other cities. We thought, 'should we go to Los Angeles or should we go to London'? 'But we said, 'look, if we do that we will still need to prove that we can do New York, whereas if we go straight to New York and we make that work, then the world is your oyster'.' Mr Pestalozzi, Nathan Dalah and Casper Ettelson, the founders of the salad bowl restaurant Fishbowl, opened their first store in Bondi Beach in 2016. The friends wanted to build a brand and product around healthy living and their salad bowls are designed with Japanese, Malaysian, Southeast Asian and Chinese influences. 'The Bondi image isn't something we've intentionally tried to convey,' Mr Pestalozzi said. 'It's just very much where we started. The brand is who we are and the lifestyle that we lead just has that sort of Australian healthy outdoor feeling. 'We want to create an authentic brand experience.' He's confident the Fishbowl experience will carry over the America, despite the name change. The trio threw caution to the wind when they decided to open their first store in Bondi and had known little about the challenges they would face during the Covid pandemic Fishbowl offers healthy Asian-inspired salad bowls priced below $20. The entrepreneur believes the casual bowls are ready to compete in New York's ultra-crowded food...",0
Snow way! NYC could see up to 4 inches of snow overnight Friday,2024-02-17T02:43:30+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/16/us-news/nyc-could-see-up-to-4-inches-of-snow-overnight-friday/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Old Man Winter is taking a bite out of the Big Apple.  As much as 4 inches of snow could blanket New York City overnight Friday into Saturday — just days after the last winter storm passed through the area.   The quick-moving low-pressure system is expected to arrive around midnight, beginning as flurries before snowfall rates could intensify.  Snow could fall at a rate of a ½-inch to 1-inch per hour at some points between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m., according to the National Weather Service.  By the time the storm pulls away before noon Saturday, the five boroughs could pick up anywhere from 2 to 4 inches, the NWS said.  “There was always a chance to see multiple rounds of snow this week,” Fox News meteorologist Samantha Thomas said, following Tuesday’s snowstorm that dumped roughly 4 inches on the city and forced schools to close. “The totals have increased a little bit over the last couple of days,” Thomas noted. Friday’s system is tracking a bit farther south than Tuesday’s. Philadelphia, Washington, DC, and Baltimore are all expected to receive accumulating snow.  The NWS warned the snow-covered roads and visibility as low as 1/2 to 1 mile could be dangerous for those traveling. To some New Yorkers, the news of another snowstorm came as a shock. “You’re joking,” Christina Blackwell told The Post on 5th Avenue in Park Slope, where some side streets began receiving their first coating of salt.  Blackwell was joined by her best friend and her friend’s 4-year-old son, Evan. “Every time they say it’s going to snow it doesn’t happen,” she added. Others had little concern. “That’s not enough,” said John, 33, from Sunset Park, who planned to continue drinking at a local watering hole, Union Hall.  He said the constant weather-related warnings are overblown, pointing to a snowball’s worth of leftover snow from Tuesday’s school-closing storm.  Oscar, 29, a cook at Tacos Morelos food truck, said he had no intention of changing his plan to close up at 4 a.m.  “I’m from Buffalo, that’s nothing,” said attorney and longtime Brooklyn resident Thomas Wojtaszek about the forecast. Fortunately, the storm will be in and out quickly. “We can still see lingering snow showers throughout the day, a few bursts here and there but for the most part it’s going to be overnight and a lot of people are going to be waking up to snow tomorrow morning,” Thomas said. Temperatures are expected to plummet Saturday night with wind chills in the upper teens on Sunday morning before some warmer weather rolls in during the week, she said. Advertisement",0
Vision Pro Visors Are Cracking Without Reasoning,2024-02-25T22:28:44+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/vision-pro-visors-are-cracking-without-reasoning/,"Apple’s Vision Pro users are noticing the front glass is cracking down the middle. This has happened for a small, yet growing number of people. What’s a mystery is the cause, as owners claim they haven’t dropped, mishandled, or abused the device. Owners are concerned as this headset is an ultra-premium device, and the idea of having to pay for expensive repairs for unexplainable problems seems to not sit right. Apple has yet to issue an official statement about why some users are experiencing these cracks, or how it plans to address it. A lot of speculation has been circulating about how to avoid this issue. The repair itself costs around U$800 (approx. A$1,218), but if the user purchases the U$500 Apple Care+ plan, this drops to U$300. However, the user is still U$800 out of pocket. The first reported cracked screen issue was posted on Reddit on February 5th, three days after the Vision Pro was launched. A faint white line appeared from the bottom center of the glass, similar to the cracks that appeared in the first generation of folding phones.  Reportedly, there were manufacturing issues which delayed the launch of the headset. The glass surface covers the lidar sensor, and there’s a possibility a crack could affect depth mapping. A 10-foot drop test resulted in a visor that cracked like automotive safety glass, however drops weren’t an issue among users. One user was initially denied a replacement by an Apple senior customer support agent, and then faced delays due to the local Apple Store being too busy. Eventually, they got a replacement. A Reddit user received 417 upvotes on a post titled “Cracked! But Not Dropped.” Some cracks are also worse than others, with one example showcasing a line of broken glass that runs top to bottom in contrast to the black of the front panel. Some have reported leaving their headsets charging with the protective front cover on, while others say they place them in their case. Due to the battery being external, there’s no reason for any thermal expansion to affect the headset and glass. For anyone who has already suffered a cracked front glass, try again if the first claim is rejected by a representative, because another one may offer a replacement.    02 9002 5900   [email protected] Level 1, 275 Alfred Street

Apple Reportedly Exploring AirPods With Built-In Cameras And Health Sensors,2024-02-25T21:52:38+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1525826/apple-airpods-built-in-cameras-health-sensors-rumor/,"We may receive a commission on purchases made from links. 
In July last year, Bloomberg reported that Apple was planning a handful of health-centric enhancements for the AirPods, including a temperature sensor. The latest edition of Bloomberg's PowerOn newsletter says Apple is exploring something even more ambitious and could put a camera on its wireless earbuds.





""The company is exploring the idea of putting cameras on the earbuds, along with more advanced AI and health sensors,"" says the report. Currently under development under the internal project name B798, the company is reportedly aiming to add low-resolution camera sensors inside earbuds that chase a form factor similar to the AirPods.
This would be the first such attempt from any mainstream brand to put a camera sensor inside truly wireless earbuds. But there are some examples in a slightly modified form factor. E-commerce platforms like Amazon and AliExpress have listed neckband-style Bluetooth earphones with a camera sensor aimed at video capture, not snazzy fitness features. 
So far, we have only seen audio gear capable of measuring heart rate. Last year, Google scientists used off-the-shelf noise-canceling earbuds and relied on audioplethysmography (APG) tech to measure a person's heart rate without modifying the hardware. All it needs is a software update loaded with the necessary data collection algorithm to measure heart activity using earbuds that offer an Active Noise Cancelation (ANC) feature.

Ricky Wilson Recalls Bizarre Story of Shane MacGowan Smoking Drugs from an Apple ,2024-02-25T18:48:23+00:00,https://americansongwriter.com/ricky-wilson-recalls-bizarre-story-of-shane-macgowan-smoking-drugs-from-an-apple/,"

 While most know him for being the frontman of the rock band Kaiser Chiefs, Ricky Wilson watched as the group went through several changes over the decades. Before they were the Kaiser Chiefs, Wilson, with the help of Nick Hodgson and Andrew White, formed the band Runston Parva. That band would eventually change their name and bring on new members, becoming Kaiser Chiefs. Although enduring growing pains throughout their time in music, Wilson recently recalled some of the interesting stories he had while in the spotlight. And one of his most bizarre surrounded the late Shane MacGowan. Taking part in the Flashback Series for The Guardian, Wilson not only helped recreate a vintage photo but also took a trip down memory lane. While understanding the pressures that come with being famous, the singer admitted to being “starstruck” when it came to rubbing shoulders with other stars. He explained, “I was always starstruck, too – we’d get to a festival, lock ourselves in our dressing room, and point and stare at all the other artists as they arrived.”  One of those stars happened to be MacGowan, the lead singer for the Pogues. With a persona that The New York Times called “a titanically destructive personality”, Wilson learned that the singer enjoyed a good apple. Or at least he thought. “Shane MacGowan once came into our dressing room. He was amazing. He asked for an apple from our rider. I thought: “Good for you, Shane, one of your five a day!” We didn’t realise he was going to smoke cr**k out of it.” Besides sharing a love for music, Wilson, much like MacGowan, struggled when it came to alcohol. Dealing with stage fright, the singer admitted to relying on alcohol to cope. “For a lot of people in bands, it becomes a habit, a pre-show superstition. You end up not being able to perform without it. That can be dangerous. It started off as fun, but a few years ago I realised if you are going on stage drunk and trying to hide that you are drunk, that’s when things have gone bad. It inhibits your performance. It’s a tightrope – people want you to be rock’n’roll, but not too rock’n’roll.” [RELATED: Shane MacGowan’s Widow Nudged “From the Other Side” To Pick up Guitar for First Time Since Husband’s Death] No longer relying on alcohol to get him through shows, Wilson shared his new routine, which involved disco. “We do have a disco before we go on stage, though. Twenty five minutes of blasting out songs that have dance routines in the lyrics, like Black Lace’s Superman.”  As for MacGowan, he sadly passed away in November 2023 at the age of 65 after battling pneumonia. Many singers and even stars like Johnny Depp paid their respects to the singer who embraced Celtic punk.  (Photo by Lia Toby/Getty Images) See more Only members can comment. Become a member.

Apple’s wearable ideas include smart glasses and cameras in your ears,2024-02-25T16:57:22+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/25/24082760/apple-smart-glasses-airpods-cameras-smart-ring,"By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. Apple’s future roadmap for wearables may include AI-powered smart glasses, as well as AirPods with cameras, according to Mark Gurman in today’s Power On newsletter for Bloomberg. Both concepts are in the exploratory phase inside Apple, representing more of a look at the company’s future plans than discreet products. The smart glasses would be angled as AirPods stand-ins, he says, just with more sensors, AI features, and longer-lasting batteries. But even though they’d serve as a cheaper head-worn gadget than the Vision Pro, they wouldn’t be the AR face computer with high-quality transparent displays that Apple is trying to get to. Gurman writes that these glasses would instead be a step in that direction that’s more comparable to Meta Ray-Bans, which feature a camera and an AI assistant you can talk to, but no display. Apple also reportedly started looking into camera-equipped AirPods last year, under the codename B798. If the company can pull it off, they would reportedly be roughly the same size as modern AirPods, just with embedded, low-resolution cameras that would be paired with AI to help users with their routines. Apple is looking for ways to bolster its wearables division as its existing products have matured. Putting cameras on AirPods is a decidedly wacky idea that vaguely points at Apple’s plans for generative AI, and who knows — if people are open to face computers, why not ear cameras, too? Gurman mentions that the long-rumored Apple smart ring idea still has its champions in Cupertino, but Apple isn’t actively developing anything in what’s still an interesting, but unproven wearable category.  The company has put much more work into AR glasses, though. And with Meta having established that compelling, screen-less smart glasses are possible, it makes sense that Apple might be starting down that avenue.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

This iPad is only $20 more than it was on Black Friday,2024-02-25T16:52:47+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/9th-generation-102-inch-apple-ipad-deal-best-buy-february-2024/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? The tablet market is full of options that range from ruggedly-designed tablets for kids to professional creative tools. Apple’s iPad is one of the most popular tablet lineups, with the best iPads offering a similar range of versatility. The lineup includes entry-level options and professional tools for creators. iPads also make some of the best Apple deals, as retailers like Amazon and Best Buy regularly drop the price of older iPad models. Right now you can find some great iPad deals across the lineup, with newer and more expensive models checking in with some savings alongside older iPad models. We’ve tracked down what we feel are the best iPad deals currently taking place, as well as deals on some accessories you should consider if you decide to make a purchase. Apple’s A13 Bionic chip is no M1 or M2, but it still offers 64-bit architecture and neural engine support for excellent performance. In other words, this 10.2-inch iPad is incredible value. It has a 10.2-inch Retina display, 64GB of storage, supports Touch ID and Apple Pencil (1st Gen), and it’s size, plus all-day battery life make it an excellent choice for anyone with an on-the-go lifestyle.  The 10.9-inch iPad remains one of the best iPads for someone on a budget. If you just want an easy to use tablet to browse the internet, watch some streaming shows, and do other straightforward tasks, it’s a reasonable solution. The 10th Gen version is powered by Apple’s A14 Bionic chip, has a liquid Retina display, WiFi 6 for better connectivity, and works with Touch ID.  A “little powerhouse”, the Apple iPad Mini is ideal if you need a more portable iPad. It has a smaller 8.3-inch screen but that makes it the perfect middle ground between your phone and a laptop. Performance is pretty good from the A15 Bionic processor which is the same as the one on the iPhone 13. There’s support for the Apple Pencil too making it an ideal tablet for sketching out designs or taking notes. If you want a smaller tablet, this is perfect. Previous iPad Minis weren’t so great performance wise and had a smaller display, but the 6th generation model fixes that.  Offering incredible value, the iPad Air is a great option if you don’t want to splurge on the iPad Pro but you still want plenty of power. While the screen isn’t quite as good as the iPad Pro, everything else about it is high-end including its M1 processor. Thanks to plenty of accessory compatibility, it’s a good bet for when you need to be more productive, but is great for relaxing, too. All-day battery life keeps you going into the late hours without a charge.  You can enrich your iPad experience with accessories. For example, with an Apple Pencil you can sketch out designs or write notes. The Magic Keyboard makes it easier to type up essays or other reports, while there are many case options for keeping your beloved tablet safe. If you are going to get a stylus, rea...",2

Apple Vision Pro: Unveiling the Latest Breakthrough in VR Technology,2024-02-25T13:00:00+00:00,https://www.devicemag.com/apple-vision-pro-unveiling-the-latest-breakthrough-in-vr-technology/,"DeviceMAG » Entertainment » Gaming Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been receiving a lot of attention lately due to the introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a new VR headset from Apple. The Apple Vision Pro blends digital and virtual realms. It features ultra-high resolution and a 3D user interface. With visionOS, it transforms how you interact with apps and content. If you’ve been looking for Apple Vision Pro news, you’ve come to the right place. Let’s review the Apple Vision Pro and discuss the impact it will have on society.  The concept of virtual reality (VR) has captivated imaginations for decades, as it has the potential to create immersive, lifelike experiences. Its journey, however, began long before the sleek headsets of today. Let me talk a bit about that.  Early entries into VR go back to the 1920s with flight simulators, laying the groundwork for more comprehensive experiences.  The 1990s saw a surge in VR development, particularly in the gaming industry, but limitations in processing power prevented widespread adoption.  However, due to significant advancements in display technology, processing power, and sensors, VR has gone up in popularity in the recent years.  Nowadays, VR and AR technologies and headsets offer improved visuals, motion tracking, and user interaction, offering a more immersive and interactive experience. Currently, VR technologies and applications go beyond gaming, with use cases in education, healthcare, and training. From virtual classrooms allowing students to explore historical sites to rehabilitation programs offering controlled environments for patients, VR technology continues to amaze me.  Here are some of my favorite features of the Apple Vision Pro:  In terms of the Apple Vision Pro specs, you will enjoy fast processing power with the M2 chip. It also offers amazing speeds and a high-quality UltraDepth camera.The Apple Vision Pro gaming and Apple Vision Pro video features are all high-quality as well.  What about the Apple Vision Pro price?  The starting price of Apple Vision Pro augmented reality headset is $3,499, making it a pricier product compared to most VR headsets currently available. However, payment plans are available.  If you are comparing the Meta Quest 3 vs. the Apple Vision Pro, it’s no comparison. For example, the Meta Quest 3 features a Snapdragon chip for processing, which is decent but offers subpar performance for gaming and processing speed compared to the M2 chip.   The Apple Vision Pro software and Apple Vision Pro apps are powered by top-notch Apple Vision Pro hardware; it has the M2 chip for performance and the R1 chip, which is designed to handle spatial computing tasks at fast speeds.  The many Apple Vision Pro configuration options allow you to customize the experience to your personal preferences. It also has excellent object recognition capabilities to blend the digital and physical world together.  Additionally, the Micro-OLED display on the Apple Vision Pro headset de...",3

Medically reviewed by
Kathy Shattler, MS, RDN  You might have heard about apple cider vinegar baths and how they bring on a plethora of health benefits. But what do they actually consist of, are they as healthy as they seem, and how often can you take them?  Apple cider vinegar (ACV) has been a well-known remedy for thousands of years, and it was used for a myriad of medicinal treatments such as fighting coughs and infections, showcasing its powerful antimicrobial and antifungal properties. Today, ACV is also being used to treat skin issues, acid reflux, and other digestive disorders and help with weight loss. Taking it on an empty stomach first thing in the morning is said to coat your gut lining and help lower inflammation. Now the trend of getting an ACV bath has taken over the world, with many people swearing about its wonderful benefits.  Apple cider vinegar is twice-fermented apple juice that transforms alcohol into acetic acid. When you’re buying it in the grocery store, you can get pasteurized or raw apple cider vinegar. Raw ACV usually has more natural bacteria and yeast, commonly known as “the mother,” which can usually be seen as the sediment at the bottom of the bottle.  Apple cider vinegar contains naturally occurring probiotics[1] and antioxidants which can help fight free radicals and protect you from oxidative cell damage. It also helps inhibit bacteria growth,[2] may help lower your blood sugar levels,[3] and heals skin infections and issues, making it an amazing remedy[4] for sensitive skin.  Apple Cider Vinegar Bath Benefits Apple cider vinegar has powerful antimicrobial and antifungal properties that help protect the body from infections[2] as well as inhibit bacterial growth. Studies also show its potent antifungal characteristics that help against denture stomatitis, food-borne pathogens, and a variety of other microbial infections.  Furthermore, ACV helps protect your entire body against microbial protein expression, fungal infection and even damaged skin which causes bacteria build-up and inflammation. Some of the most prominent bacteria that ACV affects include Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans.  Beca...",0

			Trending:		 LONDON — The European Union leveled its first antitrust penalty against Apple on Monday, fining the U.S. tech giant nearly $2 billion for unfairly favoring its own music streaming service by forbidding rivals like Spotify from telling users how they could pay for cheaper subscriptions outside of iPhone apps. Apple muzzled streaming services from telling users about payment options available through their websites, which would avoid the 30% fee charged when people pay through apps downloaded with the iOS App Store, said the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer. “This is illegal. And it has impacted millions of European consumers who were not able to make a free choice as to where, how and at what price to buy music streaming subscriptions,” Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said at a news conference in Brussels. Apple — which contests the decision — behaved this way for a decade, resulting in “millions of people who have paid two, three euros more per month for their music streaming service than they would otherwise have had to pay,” she said. It’s the culmination of a bitter, yearslong feud between Apple and Spotify over music streaming supremacy. A complaint from the Swedish streaming service five years ago triggered the investigation that led to the $1.95 billion fine. The decision comes the same week new rules take effect to prevent tech giants from cornering digital markets. The EU has led global efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies, including three fines for Google totaling more than 8 billion euros, charging Meta with distorting the online classified ad market and forcing Amazon to change its business practices. Apple’s fine is so high because it includes an extra lump sum to deter it from offending again or other tech companies from carrying out similar offenses, the commission said. It’s not the only penalty that the tech giant could face: Apple is still trying to resolve a separate EU antitrust investigation into its mobile payments service by promising to open up its tap-and-go mobile payment system to rivals. Apple hit back at the commission and Spotify, saying it would appeal Monday’s fine. “The decision was reached despite the Commission’s failure to uncover any credible evidence of consumer harm, and ignores the realities of a market that is thriving, competitive, and growing fast,” the company said in a statement. It said Spotify stood to benefit from the EU’s move, asserting that the Swedish streaming giant met over 65 times with the commission during the investigation, holds a 56% share of Europe’s music streaming market and doesn’t pay Apple for using its App Store. “Ironically, in the name of competition, today’s decision just cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is the digital music market’s runaway leader,” Apple said.

Here are the best iPad deals right now,2024-03-04T22:50:59+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple,"By  Quentyn Kennemer and  Antonio G. Di Benedetto If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon’s various Prime Days, many of the best iPad deals from the holiday season have persisted into 2024. The discounts come and go like changing winds, but you can still take advantage of sales on many models today, particularly on the more affordable iPads. What’s more, prices are likely to drop even further when Apple ushers in a new slate of iPad Pro and iPad Air models, which will reportedly now happen in May. Forthcoming models aside, it’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the cheapo ninth-gen iPad of 2021 to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M1 and M2 chips. Announced alongside the iPhone 13, the 2021 iPad is Apple’s aging entry-level tablet that still makes a fine device for doing the basics today. The ninth-gen model starts at $329 with 64GB of storage, though the base configuration with Wi-Fi is available right now for around $249 ($80 off) at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, which is just $20 shy of its lowest price to date. As for the 256GB model that normally retails for $479, Amazon and Walmart are both selling it for $379 ($100 off), which is another second-best price. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the LTE model is also often on sale. Right now, you can get it with 64GB of storage for $379.99 ($80 off) at Amazon and Best Buy or with 256GB of storage at Amazon and Best Buy for $529.99 ($80 off). A last-gen model is still worth considering The last-gen iPad uses an A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP wide-angle camera with Center Stage, a feature designed to keep you framed up and centered while on video calls. The tablet also carries over a number of features from its predecessor, such as the 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard. Apple’s entry-level iPad from 2021 has a 10.2-inch screen, an A13 Bionic chip, and a 12MP front camera that supports Apple’s Center Stage feature. It’s also compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard and is the only iPad that still has a 3.5mm headphone jack. Although the newer 10th-gen iPad came out in late 2022, the last-gen model is still an excellent tablet — one we consider to be a better value in most instances. The latest iPad modernizes the design with a switch to USB-C, uniform bezels with no home button, a side power button with a fingerprint sensor, and a larger display, but it excises the headphone...",2

"Apple Vision Pro, the new norm for the rich",2024-03-04T22:23:30+00:00,https://northernstar.info/113888/lifestyle/apple-vision-pro-the-new-norm-for-the-rich/,"Advertisement Northern Illinois University’s student news organization since 1899 Ensure student journalism survives. Donate today. After its release in early February, tons of videos and photos have surfaced of users trying Apple’s new Vision Pro in unconventional places. From social norms such as “don’t text and drive” or “don’t be on your phone while walking,” it appears the vision pros are socially acceptable because of the high status it gives people due to the exclusivity of the product.  The Vision Pros were released Feb. 2 for $3,500, not including Apple Care which is insurance for the eyewear. Additional charges may include spending more money for a larger amount of storage as well as Apple Care for drops, spills and falls. The Vision Pro allows users to navigate the screen with the touch of their finger. On top of being able to navigate the screen with eye tracking technology, users will wear a headset that shows all of the apps they would normally see on an Apple device like an iPhone or iPad. Items included in the box include a cover for the headset, battery, polishing cloth and a charger with an adapter.  An important factor to note is the Vision Pros are not designed for those who wear glasses. Although, when purchasing online, Apple allows those who need glasses to purchase additional inserts that accommodate most prescriptions. The promo video released by Apple four weeks ago shows users many uses for the Vision Pros, whether it be using them for entertainment, work or FaceTiming others. Apple also teased the Vision Pros being used in an airplane, and since its release, photos have surfaced of users using the goggles in unusual places like on a train or in the pool although it is not waterproof or resistant. Since the release, many influencers have been reviewing the product and testing the limits. Influencers such as Nikias Molina have released videos documenting the Vision Pros and its ability. Videos surfaced online of Molina using the Vision Pros on a subway appearing to be typing, but to others who are not using the equipment, it looks as if he is typing on nothing. Sometimes though, the smartest tech isn’t always the smartest decision. People tend to put their trust into technology because it lessens the risk for human error. Yet over the years, technology has gone to show it too can malfunction. We have gotten self-driving cars from Tesla, and since then, there have been malfunctions causing accidents all in the name of smart technology. Vision Pros enable users to use the equipment and to complete tasks on the side since users are still able to see their surroundings through the eyewear. Being on your phone while driving, walking or having your earbuds in has all been looked down upon just because it can be a distraction. Laws have been made to prevent people from using their phones while driving, and being on your phone while walking is criticized.  The release of the Vision Pros appears to have a double standard when it ...",2

Gizmodo had a chance to see the new Airs in person, but while the starting $1,099 laptop might look very similar to fans, most of the new stuff you’ll care about is being stuffed underneath the hood. While they look very similar to the 2022 Macbook Air, with all the same colorways you’ve come to expect, you’ll need to boot them up to get the real change. The laptops also now support WiFi 6E, allowing faster download speeds. Along with the speed and power of the M3 upgrade, the latest MacBook Air will support two external displays when the laptop is closed, compared to the one external monitor previous Airs could support. You won’t be able to keep the MacBook open and use both external monitors simultaneously, so keep that in mind for those looking to maximize productivity. Apple’s latest version of the MacBook Air still comes in 13- or 15-inch varieties, and the company is touting an 18-hour battery life, though we’d need to put the laptop through its full paces before subscribing to that claim. Otherwise, they still support the IPS LCD Liquid Retina displays up to 500 nits of brightness. The new version of MacBook with M3 starts at $1,099 at 13 inches and $1,299 at 15 inches. The older rendition of the light laptop will also be a little lighter on your wallet. Those seeking out the 13-inch M2 version can now expect to pay $100 less MSRP when buying new, which is a nice deal considering the M3 version of the MacBook Pro effectively replaced the M2 version. You can preorder both devices starting Monday, and they should become fully available Thursday, March 8. As for how it looks, there’s no major difference between this and the previous MacBook Air. It still comes in Silver, Space Gray, cream-colored Starlight, and the anodized Midnight black tone. There are two Thunderbolt ports, a MagSafe charging dock on one side, and a single headphone jack on the other. Both the 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch screens are disrupted by the notch hanging down to the top of the screen, as much as we might wish that a black bar cutting into the screen would vacate the premises. If you like your laptops as thick as a frisbee, then the MacBook Air has long been one of the better choices for ultra-thin productivity tasks. Specifically comparing performance to the M1 version released four years ago, Apple claimed the M3-powered MacBook Air should be able to handle Final Cut Pro tasks 60% faster than the M1 for editing. You don’t get a choice of the M3 Pro or M3 Max, though you can opt for a version with a 10-core GPU, up to 16 GB of memory, and 512 GB of SSD storage. Apple’s doing a lot more to promote the power of its latest laptops, even beyond what it has in the past. It now claims the latest laptops are even better at gaming, claiming accelerated performance on games ...",2

     An Apple Airtag helped an Atlanta family quickly recover their stolen car, but the family is still desperately looking for their stolen dog, Dior. (FOX 5) A Waco, Texas man who allegedly installed an Apple AirTag on a woman’s car to track her has been arrested, according to reports. KWTX in Waco reported that 39-year-old Hugo Mendez is charged with unlawfully installing a tracking device. In a court affidavit obtained by the station, police allege a woman began getting AirTag notifications on her phone on Aug. 14, 2023. The woman told police she did not own an AirTag and became suspicious about the notifications. FLORIDA FAMILY USES APPLE AIRTAG TO LOCATE STOLEN LUGGAGE FROM A NORTH CAROLINA AIRPORT TO SUSPECT'S HOME Hugo Mendez is accused of placing an Apple AirTag under a vehicle to track down the owner. (McLennan County Jail) After searching for an AirTag device near her, she eventually found a magnetic box attached to the underside of her vehicle, the affidavit alleged. Inside the metal box was an Apple AirTag, which is a tracking device meant to keep track of personal belongings in the event they are lost. Since being introduced into the market, the nearly quarter-sized devices have been used for nefarious purposes, such as tracking would-be victims.  After learning about the findings, police obtained a subpoena and served it to Apple, later finding out that the tracker belonged to Mendez.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, Noah Berger 
	A lawyer for a group of iPhone owners says a British Columbia judge has approved a countrywide multimillion-dollar settlement with tech giant Apple over software updates that allegedly slowed down older devices. 
	Lawyer K.S. Garcha says class members who make claims on the $14.4-million settlement can expect to receive between $17.50 and $150 each, depending on how many people submit a claim for the settlement money. 
	The settlement covers eligible residents of Canada except those in Quebec, which Garcha says could reach nine million people. 
	He says the settlement process took a couple of years, with Apple agreeing to a ""compromise"" without admitting any wrongdoing. 
	Garcha says the class-action lawsuit was a ""complex matter"" involving novel legal theories about the company putting software on devices without the owners' consent. 
	The B.C. lawsuit was originally filed in 2018, and Apple settled a similar case in the United States involving so-called throttling of iPhone 6 and 7 models, and Garcha says American class members ended up with US$92 payouts.

Is it time to freshen up your hardware? If you saw the news about Apple dropping the MacBook Air M3, you may be wondering whether it’s time to upgrade from your trusty MacBook Air M1 model from 2020. The new MacBook Air M3 includes big performance boosts and a newer design, so here’s what you need to know to make a decision about whether it’s time to invest in a brand new MBA for 2024. It’ll cost you at least £1,099/$1,099 to grab a new MacBook Air M3 model, whereas the MacBook Air M1 can be snagged for around £300 less than that as retailers look to shift the remaining inventory. The happy middle ground might be the MacBook Air M2, which is £999/$999. MacBook Air M1 is now at a clearance price Apple’s MacBook Air M1 (2020) can be nabbed for under £800 with Amazon essentially putting it on clearance.
 Apple’s MacBook Air M1 (2020) can be nabbed for under £800 with Amazon essentially putting it on clearance. Apple’s latest generation of the Apple Silicon M-Series chips, the M3 which is built on a is now available within a MacBook Air, as well as a MacBook Pro. The 8-core CPU is up to 35% faster than the M1, so you’ll notice a true uptick for productivity tasks, while the 10-core GPU is up to 65% faster than the M1, making it a great upgrade for gaming and working within creative editing apps. Apple says the M3 has offers 60% faster Neural Engine performance than the M1 too, which should see a massive uptick in the efficiency of machine learning tasks. So, if you’d noticed that M1 MacBook Air beginning to struggle with more basic tasks, an upgrade to the M3 will offer a truly noticeable improvement. The M1, for example, had a transistor count of 16 billion, while the M3 has a 25 billion count. There’s also unified memory of 24BGs vs 16GB on the M1. With the MacBook Air M2 generation, Apple overhauled the M1’s dated “wedge”design with one more akin to the MacBook Pro. That has not changed with the M3 MacBook Air. The sleek upgrade offers a fantastic keyboard, large responsive trackpad, and a wider selection of colours. There was also the introduction of the MagSafe port for charging, which is along for the ride with the M3 model too. The 13.3-inch 2560 x 1600 resolution display is 13.6-inches 2560 x 1664. While the max brightness is up to 500 nits from 400 nits on the M1. If you feel like you’ve outgrown the MacBook Air M1’s 13.3-inch Retina display, then the MacBook Air M3 gives you an opportunity to expand your horizons. It comes in both 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch configurations. So, even with the smaller 13.6-inch model you’re getting a slight display-size upgrade thanks in part to the thinner bezels than on the M1 model. The MacBook Air M3 has the latest Wi-Fi 6E standard. Provided you have a compatible Wi-Fi 6...",3

A lot of market speak but this might finally convince me to upgrade from my 9 year old workhorse MacBook Air. A lot of market speak but this might finally convince me to upgrade from my 9 year old workhorse MacBook Air. I upgraded from an old intel to the top of the line MacBook Pro 16-inch 2 years ago. And it's been a great investment I don't regret at all. I won't replace my laptop until at least M5.  But you will be suprised by performance and battery life improvements you'll get switching from an Intel MacBook Air. Made in China..  Thanks China.. That looks amazing, but I'll keep my Mac Book pro from 5 years ago. It's still working well and my wife and I have no complaints. Maybe we will look into that when our computer gives up. TokyoLivingToday  07:49 am JST Made in China.. Thanks China.. Just like the computer you are now typing on. I just bought an M2 15"" MacBook Air to replace the 2017 13"" one, which I'll probably give to the in-laws as there's nothing really wrong with it except the screen's too small for my needs. I could not afford Apple products. Or just refuse to pay their price's.  I have Think Pad X1 Carbon G11. $1500.00. I am sure it can keep up with Apples latest and greatest.  Matter of fact let me take you all back when I realized I could not afford Apples price.  As an 80s kid. If you wanted a home PC. It was the Texas Instruments TI99A,  or the Commadore 64, or the what the rich kids had. The Apple I.  Its cost was $666.66....We could talk about why that price from Steve Jobs. But another conversation for another day.  TI-99A won out. Defender was fun to play in my house.   Texas instruments system made many wonderful memories.    Every since, the only apple product I have and still use is the U2 Edition 500 Gig IPOD on my Sony floor bluetoothXV800 speaker.  And I tunes. The IPOD I won in a Yamada denki raffle.

Apple Goes After Spotify After Streaming Co Got Apple Fined $3 Billion By The EU,2024-03-04T21:37:10+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/apple-goes-after-spotify-after-streaming-co-got-apple-fined-3-billion-by-the-eu/,"Serial patent thieves Apple has been fined a massive A$3 billion dollars, now they have gone after audio streaming Spotify, who kicked off the European investigation into the behaviour of the big US Company. This is a tech Company who hates competition and wants to dominate every aspect of their business even if that means stealing patented technology and trying to nobble competitors with questionable demands. This time round Apple prevented streaming services from informing users of payment options outside of their Apple app store, the European Commission said. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Apple abused its dominant position in the market for a more than a decade and they are going to have to pay for their questionable practises. She ordered the US tech giant to remove all the restrictions now Apple has said it will appeal against the decision which is seen as a means to try and get the fine reduced or killed off. In the past Apple has not been successful with their appeals as they were when they stole Masimo Oxygen measurement technology for their Apple Watches. The decision comes after the European Union started an investigation five years ago after Spotify lodged a complaint about Apple practises. In response Apple launched a blistering attack on Spotify – essentially accusing its rival of insatiable greed – and vowed to launch a legal challenge. This was expected as Apple was never going to take a fine of this magnitude without a fight and their normal mudslinging. The Commission xlaims that they have applied a base line fine and slapped an additional lump sum of €1.8 billion on top “to ensure that the overall fine imposed on Apple is sufficiently deterrent.” The complaint and the action taken by the EU centred around the restriction Apple placed on Spotify who struggles to make a profit, and Apple’s 30% fee… Vestager said Apple had restricted “developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem”. “This is illegal under EU antitrust rules,” she said. Apple’s response to their questionable actions was “No one has been harmed”. Spotify claims that the restrictions benefit Apple Music. Digital Markets Act
In January, the BBC reports, Apple announced plans to allow EU customers to download apps outside of their own app store, as the introduction of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) drew closer. The aim of the European Union’s DMA is to help competition in the technology sector and to try to break down the stronghold the likes of Apple and Google have on the market. The tech companies were given six months from August last year to comply with a full list of requirements under the new legislation or face a fine of up to 10% of their annual turnover. The firms have until later this week to comply with a raft of changes announced since the start of the year, as Apple, Meta and TikTok pursue challenges to aspects of the law. Observers claim that the move will have a “si...",-3
European Commission hits Apple with $2bln antitrust fine after Spotify complaint,2024-03-04T21:32:01+00:00,https://www.laprensalatina.com/european-commission-hits-apple-with-2bln-antitrust-fine-after-spotify-complaint/,"Brussels, Mar 4 (EFE).- United States tech giant Apple has been fined 1.84 billion euros (2 billion US dollars) by the European Commission for restricting music streaming competitors such as Spotify on its App Store, the EC announced on Monday. According to the ruling,”for a decade, Apple abused its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps through the App Store… by restricting developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem. This is illegal under EU antitrust rules,” said Margrethe Vestager, Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy. The EC, which considers the fine to be “proportionate to Apple’s global revenues” – it amounts to 0.5% of the company’s annual turnover – and “necessary to achieve deterrence,” has ordered the firm led by Tim Cook to stop restricting its competitors and to refrain from engaging in similar practices. “If Apple abuses its dominant position, we will detect such illegal behavior, we will bring it to an end and we will punish Apple for it,” Vestager warned at a press conference. The EC attributed Apple’s dominance in the market to the fact that the only way for iPhone or iPad users to download online music apps, such as Spotify – which filed the complaint in 2019 –, is through its own App Store. Apple charges its competitors a 30% commission on the subscription plans they offer to users who can only access them through the App Store, while these competitors pass the premium price on to users, making alternative options more expensive than Apple Music, the app installed by default on iPhones and iPads. In addition, the EC has found that the App Store rules prevent Apple Music’s competitors from informing iOS users about subscription prices or price differences outside the App Store, including links to the alternative service’s website. These restrictions are “neither necessary nor proportionate for the protection of Apple’s commercial interests,” the EC said. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) welcomed the EC’s decision as “a strong signal in favor of consumers,” stressing that this was a case where a “dominant company exploits its market power to impose unfair trading conditions on others to the detriment of consumers.” “This decision is very good news for consumers. It confirms that Europe’s consumers have the right to see information about cheaper choices of music streaming services without Apple blocking this,” said BEUC Director General Monique Goyens. Apple issued a statement on Monday opposing to the ruling and declared its intention to appeal. In the statement, Apple affirmed its commitment to give developers what they need to create great apps that drive innovation and empower people. “Apple has been part of Europe for more than 40 years, and today we support more than 2.5 million jobs across the continent. We’ve helped markets thrive by fostering competition and innovation at every turn...",-3
‘Argylle’ Sets Digital Release for This Week,2024-03-04T21:30:00+00:00,https://www.thewrap.com/argylle-digital-release-date/,"Universal will handle the home video release of the film ahead of its eventual Apple TV+ streaming debut Apple Original Films’ “Argylle” will be released on premium video on-demand and digital rental starting this Tuesday. As with its theatrical release, Apple will partner with Universal on the release of “Argylle” to home platforms. The film is set to make its streaming release on Apple TV+ at a later date.  Directed and produced by Matthew Vaughn, “Argylle” stars Bryce Dallas Howard as a reclusive author of a series of hit spy novels who discovers that her writing closely mirrors the actions of an actual spy organization, making her a top target in the underground world of espionage.  Acquired by Apple for $200 million, “Argylle” is part of a campaign by the tech money-fueled studio to draw eyes to Apple TV+ by releasing big-budget films from top filmmakers in theaters with the help of legacy studios. But “Argylle” ended up being a box office bust, grossing just $92.2 million worldwide amidst poor reviews.  Upcoming Apple films set for theatrical release include an untitled Greg Berlanti romantic comedy starring Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum set for release in July and the thriller “Wolfs” starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt hitting theaters in September. Both films will be distributed by Sony Pictures.   Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment *  Name *  Email *  Website

"Streamer Deezer cheers Apple antitrust fine, but calls tech giant’s DMA response ‘deceptive’",2024-03-04T21:17:03+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/04/streamer-deezer-cheers-apple-antitrust-fine-but-calls-tech-giants-dma-response-deceptive/,"Streaming music service Deezer is joining Spotify in cheering the European Union’s €1.84 billion fine imposed on Apple for breaking antitrust rules in the streaming music market. However, the company urges the EU Commission to assess Apple’s response to the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which it says is “deceptive” and “an attempt to bypass European regulations.” In a statement issued today, Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueira only cautiously praised the incoming fine, noting, “It’s very positive to see that the EU is taking action against Apple and is showing readiness to firmly sanction anti-competitive practices.” However, the streaming music exec also pushed the EU Commission to reexamine Apple’s DMA terms in light of this new fine to make it clear that what Apple has proposed is not enough to comply with the new regulation. Apple’s new DMA rules, introduced in January, are a complicated means of providing a path forward for app developers to distribute apps from alternative app marketplaces. Along with the changes to Apple’s rules and commission structure, the company introduced new business terms for any developers who choose to step outside Apple’s own App Store. If developers opt into the DMA terms, they will have to pay a new “Core Technology Fee,” which charges them €0.50 for each first annual app install per year over a 1 million threshold. Instead of leveling the playing field for developers, as the DMA intended, this fee ensures Apple can still tap into the revenues of larger businesses that operate outside its App Store. Deezer is among those developers who drafted an open letter to the EC last week, claiming Apple was making a “mockery” of the DMA. Other signers include Epic Games, 37signals, Proton, Spotify, and others, who collectively urged the EC to take “swift, timely, and decisive action against Apple,” to protect developers. The streaming company reiterates its complaints in a company blog post, which was updated to comment on the new fine, saying that Apple’s DMA rules are an “attempt to circumvent the new regulation with an alternative to the current business term.” It points out that although Apple reduced its commission, it introduced a new fee — the Core Technology Fee — which is “excessive” and “makes it prohibitively expensive to scale any app business profitably.” As a result, Deezer said it saw no benefit in switching to Apple’s DMA rules. Few developers have publicly said they would switch to Apple’s new terms. So far, we’ve only heard from MacPaw, the maker of a subscription service for apps, Setapp, which announced it was switching to Apple’s DMA terms last week. Today, Germany-based mobivention said it would also introduce an alternative app marketplace for B2B and B2C iOS apps. However, larger developers, like Apple critics Spotify and Epic Games, as well as tech companies like Meta, Mozilla, and Microsoft have criticized Apple’s new rules.

When Will iOS 17.4 Be Released?,2024-03-04T21:01:25+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/when-will-ios-17-4-be-released/,"Published on By Now that Apple’s pushed iOS 17.4 into beta testing, iPhone users want to know when the company will release the software. We can’t give you an exact date, but we can help you set proper expectations in this guide.  iOS 17.4 is the fourth milestone upgrade for iOS 17. As such, it will deliver more than just bug fixes and security patches. It will have new features on board as well. Apple hasn’t confirmed an official iOS 17.4 release date. Fortunately, Apple likes to stick to fairly predictable release patterns when it comes to milestone iOS upgrades. There’s also a deadline Apple needs to hit in March. This means we can provide you with a look at iOS 17.4’s potential release date and window. The iOS 17.4 release date will land in early March and here’s why.  In a press release, Apple says it will release iOS 17.4 in March. The company didn’t provide a specific release date. Apple has until March 6th to comply with the EU’s Digital Markets Act and these changes will be included in the iOS 17.4 update. March 6th lands on a Wednesday so don’t be surprised if iOS 17.4 is released for iPhone on Tuesday, March 5th. Once iOS 17.4 drops, look for the company to quickly push iOS 17.5 into beta testing with an official public release coming sometime in the spring. If security is important to you, think about installing Apple's iOS 17.4.1 update right away. The iOS 17.4.1 update includes two security patches. These patches will help keep your device and its data protected from harm. And that makes iOS 17.4.1 an important upgrade. If you missed iOS 17.4 and older software, you'll get the security patches from updates you missed when you upgrade to iOS 17.4.1. iOS 17.4 had four security patches on board.  The update also delivered quantum security protection for iMessage. The company says the upgrade gives iMessage ""the strongest security properties of any at-scale messaging protocol in the world.""  The iOS 17.3 update brought 15 new security patches to iPhone. The software also added Stolen Device Protection to iPhone. It increases the security of your iPhone and Apple ID by requiring Face ID or Touch ID to gain access to passwords, make purchases in Safari, and more. This is useful if someone gets access to your iPhone and its passcode.  iOS 17.2 delivered 10 new security patches to iPhone. If you wish to find out more, you can head on over to Apple's security site for the details. iOS 17.2 also included iMessage Contact Key Verification which improves the security of iMessage. The company also fixed an exploit that let the Flipper Zero multi-tool lock up iPhones. iOS 17.1.2 had two security patches on board. Both were related to WebKit. If you want to learn more, you can do so right here. iOS 17.1 brought 18 security fixes to iPhone. It addressed issues within Weather, Status Bar, WebKit, and more.  iOS 17.0.3 brought two patches for two security issues Apple identified within the software.

Why trust us? We’ve previously written that the addition of FaceTime and Continuity Camera to Apple TV 4K is a perfect excuse to have some sort of tripod for your iPhone in the living room. Belkin just took that idea and made it a little easier (and less expensive than our idea). Enter the appropriately named iPhone Mount with MagSafe for Apple TV 4K. Retailing for just under $50, it’s … well, it’s a MagSafe iPhone mount to use in conjunction with video calls on your Apple TV 4K. No cables required. No power needed. Just a simple way to position your iPhone to use when on FaceTime, Zoom, Webex, or the “Sing” feature on Apple Music. The mount works a couple ways. You can position it on an entertainment center or TV stand or some other flat surface. Or unfold the base and perch it atop your TV. Belkin says it’ll fit sets up to 4 inches thick, which should take care of pretty much every modern TV, as well as sets a few years old. (We’ve asked Belkin about a minimum thickness — some newer TVs are nearly paper-thin.) And if you’re really into this sort of thing, there are option keyhole mounts and brackets if you want to put it on a wall or somewhere a little more permanent. The stand tilts between negative-20 and 30 degrees and extends up to 40mm, so you can get the angle and lighting just right. (Pro tip: Try not to point it up your nose, if you can help it.) And that’s pretty much it. Belkin says the mount doesn’t require any special hardware to install, save for a supported Apple device. The mount will ship in late March. High-definition content has been a TV mainstay for more than two decades now. From broadcasted cable stations to streamable movies and shows from streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+, 1080p HD is no longer the golden standard for modern TV models. It kind of feels like a no-brainer at this point, but what you want to invest in these days is a 4K TV, as most of the best TVs available are.    4K media is also not as rare as it once was either. In fact, most new films, shows, and even video games are now engineered from the ground up with a 4K screen in mind. And not to worry if you don’t currently watch any 4K content, because most 4K TV sets do an excellent job at upscaling lower-res sources. So is it worth it to step away from your HD past in favor of a higher pixel count present and future? Let’s explore the world of 4K a little further to find the answers we seek.
What is 4K Ultra HD?
In a nutshell, 4K Ultra HD is the name assigned to a screen with a resolution that's four times that of a Full HD (1080p) TV. That translates to 8 million pixels being crammed into the same space in which a Full HD TV fits just 2 million -- achieved by making each pixel four times smaller. The result for the average viewer? A clearer image, more accurate color, and with most new TV sets, High Dynamic Range, or HDR (more on that in a bit). There’s never been a be...",1
Apple Slapped With $2 Billion Fine In EU Over Alleged Anti-Competitive Apple Music Practices,2024-03-04T20:46:41+00:00,https://sfist.com/2024/03/04/apple-slapped-with-2-billion-fine-in-eu-over-alleged-anti-competitive-apple-music-practices/,"Regulators in the European Union have hit Apple with a $2 billion fine (actually 1.8 billion euros) over allegations that Apple Music has been muscling out other streaming music platforms like Spotify in the App Store.  Spotify is the No. 1 music streaming service in terms of global market share, with about twice as many paying subscribers as its next most popular competitor, Apple Music. But Spotify feels they would have even more subscribers if Apple’s App Store hadn’t been, in their words, “denying us the ability to communicate with them about how to upgrade and the price of subscriptions, promotions, discounts, or numerous other perks.” So, back in 2019, Stockholm-based Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission and called for an antitrust investigation. And they got their way, as Bloomberg reports that on Monday morning, the European Commission hit Apple with a $2 billion fine (which equates to 1.8 billion euros) for allegedly anti-competitive actions against other music streaming rivals in the App Store.  We've fined Apple over €1.8 billion over abusive App Store rules for music streaming providersFor a decade, Apple abused its dominant position by restricting developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem.… pic.twitter.com/0Kp6qugArE  “For a decade, Apple abused its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps through the App Store,” EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. “They did so by restricting developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem.” Apple, of course, is simply vowing to appeal the decision, and says the Swedish company Spotify gamed their European regulators.  “The reality is that European consumers have more choices than ever,” Apple said in their response. “Ironically, in the name of competition, today’s decision just cements the dominant position of a successful European company that is the digital music market’s runaway leader.” This is #illegal. And it had an impact on millions of 🇪🇺 consumers, who were not able to make a #free choice as to where, how, and at what price to buy music streaming subscriptions.👉 More : https://t.co/RHpMDfFieF  This same European regulator, Margrethe Vestager, has hit tech companies with some pretty staggering fines during her tenure. She levied a $5.1 billion fine against Google in 2019 for allegedly limiting customers’ ability to search for retail shopping options of their rivals on the Android platform; and last year, she ordered Apple to pay $14 billion in back taxes over a series of allegedly improper tax breaks in Ireland.

Spotify's War on Apple Just Cost the Giant $2 Billion,2024-03-04T19:44:08+00:00,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-spotify-2-billion-fine-eu/,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Morgan Meaker Apple has a Spotify problem—and it just cost the iPhone maker a $2 billion fine from the European Commission. For years, the two companies have been at war as the streaming service lured users away from Apple’s iTunes and accused the tech giant of exploiting its dominance to stifle innovation. In their long-running conflict, each has made incursions into the other’s territory. When Apple launched its own streaming service, Apple Music, in 2015, Spotify claimed Apple was able to undercut the platform’s prices because Apple didn’t have to pay the same App Store fees as rivals. In 2019, Spotify began an ambitious podcast spending spree, splashing out on high-profile shows, in another direct challenge to Apple. The feud’s early days were civil, with few barbs traded in public. “We worry about the humanity being drained out of music,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2018, a cryptic comment widely interpreted as a jibe at Spotify’s heavy use of algorithmic recommendations. But Spotify became more outspoken as EU politicians started to call for laws to reign in Big Tech. The €1.8 billion ($1.9 billion) fine on Apple announced by the European Commission today shows that its tactics are working.The fine originates in a legal complaint filed with the European Commission by Spotify in 2019, challenging the restrictions and fees Apple places on developers listing their apps in the App Store. Today the European Commission agreed, saying that Apple’s App Store restrictions amount to unfair trading conditions that may have led iOS users to pay significantly higher prices for music streaming subscriptions. “For a decade, Apple abused its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps through the App Store,” said Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief, in a statement. “They did so by restricting developers from informing consumers about alternative, cheaper music services available outside of the Apple ecosystem.” Apple’s App Store rules restrict music streaming companies and other apps from informing their users on Apple devices about how to upgrade or sign up for subscription offers outside of the app. Instead, app users can only see sign-up options for in-app subscriptions via Apple’s payments system, where prices are likely to be higher because Apple takes a cut. Some app makers, including Spotify, do not offer in-app purchases because they don’t want to pay this commission. ""Some consumers may have paid more because they were unaware they could pay less if they subscribed outside the app,” Vestager said. “This is illegal under EU antitrust rules.” Apple, which says the EU has failed to provide credible evidence of consumer harm, has pledged to appeal. The fine is far bigger than expected, prompting Apple’s stock to drop 3 percent on Monday. Media reports based on unnamed sources had predicted a penalty of around €500 million. It’s also one of th...",2

Yesterday Apple took the wraps off of its newest MacBooks, a duet of Air models in 13- and 15-inch sizes that come equipped with the company's latest M3 processor.  Also: M3 MacBook Air review: Apple's AI computer for the masses has arrived Based on ZDNET's previous testing of Apple's redesigned MacBook Air laptops and the M3 chip in last year's Pro line, the latest release should be a recipe for success in almost every way -- from performance to battery life to AI use cases. That's right. Apple said the ""A"" word, and it's not being shy about it, as my afternoon demo of the units can attest to. Here are my big three takeaways after spending an hour with the newly-released MacBook Air. From demos of AI applications within Blender, Microsoft 365, and FreeChat, to how the M3-equipped MacBook Air -- with a more efficient 16-core Neural Engine (along with accelerators in the GPU/CPU for improved on-device machine learning) -- can run various AI models, Apple is making it clear that you don't have to go ""Pro"" to operate in today's AI-driven world. Also: M3 MacBook Air vs. M2 MacBook Air: Which Apple laptop should you buy? Developing apps on Swift, running large language models, and recording, translating, and transcribing conversations in a medical setting are all instances where the cheaper, fan-less M3 MacBook Air can deliver more than ever before. And the ultraportable nature of the model makes it preferable for students, developers, and users who need to stay mobile.

					The source for greater Aurora, Colorado				  LONDON | The European Union leveled its first antitrust penalty against Apple on Monday, fining the U.S. tech giant nearly $2 billion for breaking the bloc’s competition laws by unfairly favoring its own music streaming service over rivals. Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news Apple muzzled app developers from telling users where they could go to pay for cheaper music subscriptions instead of paying through iOS apps, said the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm and top antitrust enforcer. “This is illegal. And it has impacted millions of European consumers who were not able to make a free choice as to where, how and at what price to buy music streaming subscriptions,” Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, said at a news conference in Brussels. Apple — which said it contests the decision — behaved this way for a decade, resulting in “millions of people who have paid two, three euros more per month for their music streaming service than they would otherwise have had to pay,” she said. The 1.8 billion-euro fine follows an investigation triggered by a complaint from Swedish streaming service Spotify five years ago. Since then, the EU has drawn up new regulations taking effect this week to prevent tech giants from cornering digital markets. The EU has led global efforts to crack down on Big Tech companies, including three fines for Google totaling more than 8 billion euros and charging Meta with distorting the online classified ad market. Apple, meanwhile, also is trying to resolve a separate EU antitrust investigation into its mobile payments service by promising to open up its tap-and-go mobile payment system to rivals. The fine for the music streaming investigation is so high because it includes a big extra lump sum to deter Apple from offending again and to act as a deterrent to other tech companies from carrying out similar offenses, the commission said. Apple hit back at both the commission and Spotify, saying it wo...",-3

You can now preorder the new M3-powered MacBook Air,2024-03-04T19:03:14+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/24090194/apple-m3-macbook-air-13-15-inch-2024-preorder-how-to-buy-release-date-price,"By  Sheena Vasani, a writer covering commerce, e-readers, and tech news. She previously wrote about everything from web development to AI at Inside. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. There’s a new MacBook in town. Following months of rumors, Apple has announced a new pair of entry-level laptops, both equipped with Apple’s latest M3 chip. The 13- and 15-inch MacBook Air will start shipping tomorrow, March 8th, but you can still preorder them today for $1,099 and $1,299, respectively. According to Apple, the M3-powered MacBook Airs are faster than their M2-equipped predecessors, which is likely true in our limited testing (albeit by a small margin). Thanks to the new chip, the laptops also feature an improved 16-core Neural Engine that can “run optimized AI models,” along with hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading. They both include a Liquid Retina display and up to 500 nits of brightness, as well as MagSafe charging and two Thunderbolt ports. Along with the GPU upgrades, both laptops support up to two external displays when closed. They’re also more futureproof and support faster download speeds thanks to Wi-Fi 6E and a 6GHz band, and they come in four colors: starlight, space gray, silver, and midnight. The latter shade is built with an anodization seal that should reduce fingerprints — something that plagued the previous midnight models. Equipped with the new M3 chip, Apple’s 13-inch MacBook Air is both faster and more powerful than its predecessor. It can also connect with two external displays and includes Wi-Fi 6E support. You can currently preorder the 13-inch MacBook Air from Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, and B&H Photo starting at $1,099 with 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage. Best Buy is also offering its My Best Buy Plus members a $50 discount on all configurations, lowering the starting price to $1,049. Alternatively, the laptop is also available with an upgraded 512GB of storage for $1,299, 1TB of storage for $1,499, or with 2TB of storage for $1,899. You can also buy it with 16GB RAM and 256GB of storage for $1,299, or you can combine the extra RAM with 512GB of storage for $1,499, 1TB of storage for $1,699, or 2TB of storage for $2,099. You can also choose to configure the 13-inch laptop with 24GB of RAM. That starts at $1,499 for 256GB of storage, or you can buy it with 512GB of storage for $1,699. The 24GB laptops are also available with 1TB of storage for $1,899 or 2TB of storage for $2,299. One thing to note is that the laptops come with different power adapters, depending on the model, when you purchase them directly from Apple. Most upgraded versions come with the option of a 70W adapter included in the price. The base model, however, currently only ships with a 30W USB-C power adapter, though you can upgrade to a 35W dual-port adapter or a 70W adapter for $20 more through Apple.  Apple’s latest 15-inch MacBook Air sports a faster M3 processor and is otherwise ex...",3
When Will macOS Sonoma 14.4 Be Released?,2024-03-04T18:55:21+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/when-will-macos-sonoma-14-4-be-released/,"Published on By Apple’s confirmed a new macOS Sonoma 14.4 update, but it hasn’t attached a release date to the software. That’s left Mac users wondering when the upgrade will arrive.  macOS Sonoma 14.4 is the next major upgrade for macOS Sonoma. We expect the software to bring new features, enhancements, and under-the-hood improvements to compatible Mac models. Apple hasn’t confirmed a macOS Sonoma 14.4 release date, but it will arrive later on this month. The company recently released the macOS Sonoma 14.4 Release Candidate, or RC, which is the final version of the beta. This means the public release is imminent. With the final version of the beta live, we expect macOS Sonoma 14.4 to roll out sometime this week. At the very latest, it will emerge from beta testing next week. Once Apple pushes its macOS Sonoma 14.4 update to Mac users, you can expect the company to put a new macOS Sonoma 14.5 update into beta testing soon after.

Drake To Executive Produce New Sci-Fi Drama ‘Neuromancer’ Coming To Apple TV+,2024-03-04T18:16:07+00:00,https://hiphopwired.com/2054974/drake-excutive-producer-apple-tv-neuromancer/," Trending Source: Cole Burston / Getty / Drake The 6 God, aka Drake, is currently on tour again, calling for Tory Lanez’s freedom and, at the same time, continues making big moves in Hollywood.  Deadline reports that Apple TV+ has greenlit a new 10-episode sci-fi drama series called Neuromancer based on William Gibson’s award-winning debut novel of the same name. Skydance Entertainment and Anonymous Content will co-produce, and Drake and his production company DreamCrew Entertainment produce.  JD Dillard (Sleight, Devotion) and Graham Roland (Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, Dark Winds) will co-develop the series, with Roland as showrunner and Dillard directing the pilot episode. “We’re incredibly excited to be bringing this iconic property to Apple TV+,” Graham Roland and JD Dillard said in a joint statement. “Since we became friends nearly ten years ago, we’ve looked for something to team up on, so this collaboration marks a dream come true. Neuromancer has inspired so much of the science fiction that’s come after it, and we’re looking forward to bringing television audiences into Gibson’s definitive ‘cyberpunk’ world.” Synopsis Per Deadline: The streamer reveals Neuromancer will follow a damaged, top-rung super-hacker named Case who is thrust into a web of digital espionage and high-stakes crime with his partner Molly, a razor-girl assassin with mirrored eyes, aiming to pull a heist on a corporate dynasty with untold secrets. For Drake, he continues to dabble in the world of television. The rapper currently serves as an executive producer on Sam Levinson’s hit HBO drama series Euphoria starring Zendaya. Drake was also instrumental in helping get Top Boy’s fifth season on Netflix. It seems when it comes to hit shows, Drake has the Midas touch; we shall see if that streak continues with Neuromancer.

7 Reasons to Wait for the iPhone SE 4 & 3 Reasons Not To,2024-03-04T18:01:18+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/4-reasons-to-wait-for-the-iphone-se-4-3-reasons-not-to/,"Published on By Apple’s probably working on a new iPhone SE 4. While some of you might need to upgrade your current device in the near future, others might want to hang back and wait for the fourth-generation iPhone SE. In 2022, Apple released its iPhone SE 3, its third-generation iPhone SE. The device serves as a budget alternative to its flagship iPhone 15 series and it’s certainly worth a look if you want a newer iPhone model, but don’t want to break the bank. Many of you will be perfectly fine buying an iPhone SE 3, iPhone 15, or another device. That being said, iPhone SE 4 rumors are swirling and that might have those of you in the hunt for a new device feeling curious about Apple’s plans for its budget iPhone. While most iPhone rumors have been focused on the iPhone 16 series, we’ve also heard about a new iPhone SE 4. Analysts believe the iPhone SE 4 is currently in development and claim it will come with some interesting changes including a larger screen and an overhauled design. We’re a long way out from a potential announcement which means Apple’s plans could certainly change. That being said, there are some reasons to consider waiting for the next iPhone SE. In this guide we’ll take you through the best reasons to wait for the iPhone SE 4 and the best reasons to go with another device long before it arrives. Rumors are hinting at a new design for the iPhone SE series. Instead of looking like the iPhone 8, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to look more like the base iPhone 14. If true, it means the device will utilize a more up-to-date design language. That means it should have a larger display and a flatter, and lighter, design.  If you aren't familiar with the base iPhone 14 model, you can get a look at it in the photo above.  A sketchier rumor purports that the iPhone SE will look more like the upcoming iPhone 16. The leaker claims the iPhone SE 4 will have Dynamic Island rather than a notch.  Apple is likely testing multiple prototypes which explains why we're hearing about multiple design languages. Leaked CAD images showcase the device's rumored design in detail and they corroborate many of the design rumors. An alleged iPhone SE 4 case shared by leaker Majin Bu also features an iPhone 14-like design. Your email address will not be published.

The Greatest App of All Time: March Madness Bracket Day 4,2024-03-04T17:55:00+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/the-greatest-app-of-all-time-imessage-flappy-bird-1851305034,"It’s day 4 of Gizmodo’s March Madness bracket challenge to name the greatest app of all time! Yesterday’s match-up was the biggest blowout we’ve seen yet with Google Maps taking 96 percent of the vote and eliminating Yelp from the tournament. Today, we have another David vs Goliath fight as Apple’s iMessage takes on the legendary indie game Flappy Bird.  If you’re just tuning in, you can read all about our selection criteria for this historic contest right here. And as always, if you think we missed your personal favorite app of all time, yell at us in the comments. Now, let’s get into today’s contestants. With over a billion users, our first contestant is the envy of Android users everywhere and a thorn in Google’s side. Since its launch in 2011, iMessage has never really been considered the most advanced or most secure messaging platform but it’s to the point and the one that’s on every iPhone. Perhaps most importantly, it weeds out non-users by displaying them as green bubbles. This has become a ridiculous status symbol for petty snobs and seemingly every few months Google tries a new tactic to get Apple to open up iMessage or play nice.  But just because it’s become a status symbol doesn’t mean iMessage is a bad messenger. It has plenty of features like memoji, location sharing, reactions, apps, and stickers. But more importantly, Apple recently deployed a new ‘post-quantum encryption protocol’ that’s designed to be future-proof for the coming days when quantum computing can crack today’s standards. At the time of release, cryptography experts called it “overkill” in a good way.  Taking on iMessage, we have one of the only games on our bracket. While some people will reasonably argue that a certain game with birds that are angry would be a better fit for this list, Flappy Bird was a unique and influential phenomenon. Well, unique might be the wrong word since its visual design was so clearly ripped right out of Super Mario Bros. But its incredibly difficult tap-tap-tap gameplay was fresh and addictive. It was so addictive that its developer Dong Nguyen felt guilty and pulled it from app stores.  Seeing an opportunity, a flood of developers seized the chance to get their foot in the door in app store ranking and unleashed countless clones. The gold rush was similar to all the copycats that followed the release of Wordle. Perhaps feeling a little regret over his initial regret, Nguyen eventually released a new version of the game called Flappy Birds Family as an exclusive on the Amazon App Store.  Today, people still pay a premium on eBay to buy old phones with the original Flappy Bird installed. And developers are much more aware of the kind of impact a simple idea executed by one person can have. So, reader, what’ll it be? Should the toxic blue bubbles advance to the next round or should the game that doesn’t exist soar ahead? Voting has closed and it was a tight race but iMessage goes to the next round. RIP Flappy Bird. The Greatest App of A...",1

Apple M3 vs Apple M1: Which chip is right for you?,2024-03-04T17:36:31+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/versus/apple-m3-vs-apple-m1-4432862,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience. If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. If you’re looking for a new entry-level Mac, whether it’s the MacBook Air or the iMac, then you’ll likely come across the bleeding-edge M3 chip.  But as exciting as the Apple M3 processor is, it’s difficult to ignore the original M1 chip considering it’s now available at such a low price.  For example, you can now buy the M1-powered MacBook Air for less than £800/$800 at select retailers, whereas the M3 MacBook Air has a starting price of £1099/$1099 – that’s £300/$300 difference.  So is the M3 really worth such a big difference in price? Here’s our comprehensive comparison guide.  The Apple M1 was the very first Apple Silicon processor, marking a historic moment for the company. When it launched back in 2020, it was considered bleeding edge, but a lot has changed in that time.  Firstly, the 5nm architecture of the M1 is starting to show its age, allowing for a transistor count of 16 billion. That was remarkable at the time, but the M3 has leapfrogged that number with a fantastic 25 billion count. A greater number of transistors usually equates to a faster performance, and so the 9 billion difference is remarkable.  The Apple M3 isn’t solely relying on architectural improvements in terms of performance, however. There’s also been a jump in GPU cores, with the M1 handicapped to 7, whereas the M3 climbs up to 10. The Apple M1 is also limited to just 16GB of unified memory, while the M3 benefits from as much as 24GB.  As you can see, there are numerous big differences between the two Apple processors. So how exactly does that translate to performance? MacBook Air M1 is now at a clearance price Apple’s MacBook Air M1 (2020) can be nabbed for under £800 with Amazon essentially putting it on clearance.
 Apple’s MacBook Air M1 (2020) can be nabbed for under £800 with Amazon essentially putting it on clearance. We unfortunately haven’t been able to test the Apple M3 chip just yet, so we’re unable to provide our own benchmark results. However, Apple has made a number of big claims about the two processors, so we still have a reasonable idea regarding how they perform.  Overall, Apple claims a MacBook Air with an M3 chip is up to 1.6x faster than one powered by an M1 processor. Apple doesn’t specify what that metric that performance figure refers to, but it is still a decent indicator to show how much more powerful the M3 is.  To give an even better idea of the processing power on offer here, Apple says the M3 is up to 35% faster than the M1 when working in Excel spreadsheets.  It’s the GPU power that’s seen the biggest upgrade here though. The popular video game No Man’s Sky apparently runs 60% faster on M3 than M1, while video editing in Final Cut Pro has also seen a 60% performance boost.  And let’s not forget about AI performance, which impacts numerous features such as AI Math Assistance in Goodnotes and enhancing photos in Pi...",3

Apple's Magic Keyboard for the 11-inch iPad Pro and Air is 40 percent off,2024-03-04T17:21:48+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/apples-magic-keyboard-for-the-11-inch-ipad-pro-and-air-is-40-percent-off-172148756.html?src=rss,"Apple’s Magic Keyboard for iPad is 40 percent off right now via Amazon. That brings the price down to $180, which is a savings of around $120. It’s not the lowest price we’ve ever seen for the 11-inch keyboard, but it’s certainly close. Typical sales drop it to around $250 or so, so this is still one heck of a deal. This is $120 off, which is close to the lowest price ever recorded.  This is the perfect keyboard to turn your 11-inch iPad Pro or Air into a standalone workstation. There’s a reason, after all, why it ended up on our list of the best iPad accessories. It magnetically attaches to the tablet, with a hinge that keeps the screen floating above the keyboard. In other words, it basically turns your iPad into a laptop. We praised Apple’s Magic Keyboard for its emphasis on comfort and the precise trackpad. There are dozens upon dozens of competing third-party products out there, but none of them get the job done quite like this luxury keyboard. The major issue here is the price, which this sale somewhat alleviates. There is one other potential issue on the horizon. There are rumors circulating that Apple is about to announce a new range of iPads, which may or may not work with this keyboard. If you’re buying a keyboard for an iPad you already own, that’s no big deal. If you want to buy both at once, however, you should wait for an official announcement.

"Apple 13- and 15-inch M3 MacBook Air: Price, Specs, Availability",2024-03-04T17:20:24+00:00,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-new-13-and-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-chip/,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Brenda Stolyar In October, Apple unveiled the next-gen 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with new M3 chipsets. While it was inevitable the MacBook Air would receive the same treatment, it was mainly a question of when. The wait is finally over. Today, the company announced updated versions of its 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air with the latest M3 chip. Both models are available for purchase starting today and will begin to arrive on March 8. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Apple didn't make any external changes to either laptop. After all, it's only been two years since it launched the fully redesigned 13-inch MacBook Air—ditching the signature wedge design for a boxier frame, adding a slightly larger 13.6-inch display, upgrading the webcam to 1080p, and including a MagSafe port for charging. 15-inch MacBook Air The 15-inch MacBook Air, on the other hand, was released less than a year ago. It was the first of its kind in the Air lineup and includes a majority of the same features as its smaller counterpart. So, it makes sense that Apple kept the same design on both. The noteworthy upgrades can be found under the hood. Unlike the M1 and M2 chipsets, the M3 lineup is built on a 3-nanometer process, which means it packs more transistors into a smaller space and enhances both the speed and power efficiency of the chip. It packs new features, too, including ray tracing, mesh shading, and dynamic caching. You can read more about those features here. The M3, specifically, is Apple's latest entry-level chip. It packs an 8-core CPU and up to 10-core GPU, making it a great option for completing basic tasks like word processing, using spreadsheets, sending emails, and light gaming. Apple claims CPU performance is up to 35 percent faster and GPU performance is up to 65 percent faster when compared to the M1. Meanwhile, both the CPU and GPU are 20 percent faster than the M2. Aarian Marshall Eric Ravenscraft Parker Hall Adrienne So Apple also added support for up to two external displays. Both the M1 and M2 Macs natively support only one external monitor, so it's nice to see Apple finally making this improvement. However, an important note here is that the Air must be closed to run both displays. Both versions of the MacBook Air also come equipped with Wi-Fi 6E, offering download speeds that are twice as fast than the M2-powered versions. 13-inch MacBook Air While both the 13-inch MacBook Air and 15-inch MacBook Air are only available with the base M3 chip, with the 13 you have the choice between an 8-core or 10-core GPU. The 15 only comes in a 10-core flavor. The base models on both sizes have 8 gigabytes of unified memory and 256 gigabytes of storage. But you can upgrade both with up to 24 gigabytes of unified memory and 2 terabytes of storage—for an additional cost, of course. You'll also have the choice...",1
The MacBook Air M3 has one surprising change that totally fixes it,2024-03-04T17:17:32+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apple-introduces-macbook-air-m3-models/,"With surprisingly little fanfare — no spring event this time — Apple has dropped an update to the MacBook Air a bit sooner than expected. The incredibly thin MacBook Air 13- and 15-inch models both received updates to the Apple Silicon M3 chipsets, but that’s not all. There’s one surprising new feature in the mix that could make a big difference in purchasing decisions: support for multiple monitors with the display closed. As this was the major complaint of the previous MacBook Air, this change is a pretty big deal. While it still supports only a total of two screens, it’s a positive change for those that want to connect to two large, external monitors for work. Meanwhile, the now-relegated M2 MacBook Air M2 13-inch machine takes over Apple’s entry-level option at a competitive $999, which is a decrease of $100. The M3 chipset offers the usual speed bumps ushered in by a new generation of processors. According to Apple, the 13-inch M3 is up to 35% faster than the older M1 model when working in Excel. It’s up to 60% faster in Apple’s Final Cut Pro. And Photomator’s Super Resolution function is up to 40% faster in using AI to enhance an image. That’s thanks to Apple’s move to a 3nm process that increases performance while improving efficiency. Each M3 performance core — the core counts stay the same between the M2 and M3 — is 30% faster than M1 cores and 15% faster than those in the M2. The M3 comes in an 8-core CPU (four performance and four efficiency) and 8-core GPU version and an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU version. All versions have the same 16-core Neural Engine that’s faster than in the previous version, likely accounting for the AI improvements mentioned above. We tested the M3 chip in the latest iMac, and it provided a significant uptick over the M2. The MacBook Air may not be quite as fast, given its smaller chassis, but in Cinebench R23, the M3 iMac was 26% faster in single-core performance and 25% faster in multi-core. Doing some math, compared to the M2 MacBook Air 13-inch, the M3 version should provide a roughly 16% improvement in single-core performance and 5% in multi-core. Apple also touts the Neural Engine, along with CPU and GPU accelerators that will speed up on-device AI functionality. That’s in line with the industrywide AI push that’s seen Intel and AMD both incorporate Neural Processing Units (NPUs) in their latest chipsets. While the M3 is likely to provide a meaningful upgrade in CPU performance, it’s in the GPU that the magic happens. Apple introduced several new GPU features that are sure to provide massive improvements in graphics performance. Dynamic Caching is a memory architecture that makes the architecture’s unified memory perform more efficiently, increasing GPU utilization and speeding up performance in games and apps like Adobe Premiere Pro that can use the GPU in various demanding tasks. Mesh shading is now supported in hardware, a significant boon for gamers, and the M3 GPU also supports hardware-assisted ray ...",3

 “The parents submitting the complaints are the problem …” My media outlet has penned multiple articles and columns over the last few months addressing the proliferation of taxpayer-funded “porn propaganda” being pushed on South Carolina school children by the state’s woke-educational complex. Conflated by those on the far left as some sort of discriminatory censorship (or “book banning”), the crux of this issue is age appropriateness – and beyond that, whether children should be exposed to certain materials without parental consent (and at their expense as taxpayers). In addition to covering these ongoing indoctrination campaigns, I’ve also published reports detailing institutional and individual efforts to push back against them (see here and here) … One of the districts which has landed on my radar during this process is Anderson County school district one – which is located in the professedly “conservative” Upstate region of the Palmetto State. After being confronted by some exceedingly explicit content located in the school library at Powdersville High School, district superintendent Robbie Binnicker claimed these inappropriate titles were “part of the ‘adult’ bookshelf in the library backroom that is only available to adults in the building.” “The librarian adds a few titles every year for staff to check out,” Binnicker wrote on Facebook. Binnicker further noted the school had “removed” these controversial titles from its electronic card catalog to ensure there was “no confusion” about whether these explicit books were available to students. Problem solved, right? Wrong …  First of all, taxpayers shouldn’t be subsidizing an adult bookshelf for anyone – certainly not students, but not teachers and administrators, either. Beyond that, the reference by Binnicker to titles being removed from the card catalog was concerning – especially as it soon became clear district officials were not actually removing these titles from the school library. Was the district really endeavoring to keep explicit material away from students? Or was it trying to keep parents in the dark about the explicit materials it was providing to children? In the aftermath of our reporting last fall, one state lawmaker – representative April Cromer – submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the district seeking information about its indoctrination efforts. Cromer – whose children graduated from Anderson one – told us the district had until recently been “renowned for its conservative values,” which according to her included “shielding our children from controversial topics like critical race theory, indoctrination and preferred pronouns.” Last spring, though, Cromer was approached by a concerned parent about the district’s controversial “book review policies” – and about escalating hostilities toward parents (and stude...",0

Apple To Allow iPhone App Downloads From EU Websites,2024-03-12T22:58:16+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/apple-to-allow-iphone-app-downloads-from-eu-websites/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=apple-to-allow-iphone-app-downloads-from-eu-websites,"Apple will allow iPhone users in the European Union to download apps from websites, instead of through an App Store, as it adheres to the latest change in the EU’s Digital Markets Act. However, developers will still have to keep to Apple’s strict rules around security protections and how apps are distributed through websites. “Apps offered through Web Distribution must meet Notarisation requirements to protect platform integrity, like all iOS apps, and can only be installed from a website domain that the developer has registered in App Store Connect,” said Apple, also confirming that it will authorise developers after meeting specific criteria and committing to ongoing requirements that help protect users. Developers must be part of Apple’s Developer Program and be registered in the EU. New developers or those who didn’t achieve least a million downloads in the EU last year will not be eligible. To qualify, a developer must be “a member of good standing in the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more, and have an app that had more than one million first annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year,” Apple said. The new web distribution feature is expected to be available with a software update in Q2 of this year.    02 9002 5900   [email protected] Level 1, 275 Alfred Street

iPhone 16’s Redesign Leaked,2024-03-12T22:53:22+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/iphone-16s-redesign-leaked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=iphone-16s-redesign-leaked,"Fans of Apple are looking at some serious redesigning of the company’s next wave of iPhones, if recent leaks are anything to go by. Over the last few weeks, tipsters have released various rumoured features and specs of the upcoming iPhone models. This year, it appears the company will focus more on the entry-level models, giving them a slight design refinement on the rear shell. Leaks suggest the camera island on the upcoming iPhone 16, as well as its Plus version, will see a pill shaped change. On the iPhone 15 series, there’s diagonally arranged camera lenses on top of a square like glass bump. Apple will reportedly replace this with a vertical pill shaped camera island, first seen on the iPhone X. The rest of the device is likely to stay the same, with full-screen aesthetics topped off with the FaceID cutout, and the physical button layout. For the upcoming models, it appears Apple was happy with the iPhone 15 Pro refresh, however, one change is expected, an extra button on the right edge, below the power button. It won’t be a physical button though. Instead, it will be flush with the frame of the phone, and could feature capacitive sensors underneath. Reports suggest it will used like a camera shutter button, and could be customisable.  The antenna will also be relocated to accommodate this button, and titanium will be used to make the premium versions. There may even be a new colour, internally called “White Titanium.” The smaller ‘Pro’ model will have the same tetraprism 5x telephoto zoom treatment under the hood. This is currently exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro Max. Some internal upgrades will also take a toll on the dimensions, with claims suggesting the device will be taller, wider, and thicker than its predecessor. The Pro and Pro Max are tipped to be coming with a larger 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch display. The Pro and Pro Max versions are said to feature an upgraded 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera lens, and to support Wi-Fi 7, which would allow them to send and receive data over 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands simultaneously. Additionally, Apple’s next-generation A18 Pro chip will reportedly be manufactured with TSMC’s 2nd Gen 3nm process. All models are expected to be equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X75 modem, which supports the “5G Advanced” standard, described as “the next phase of 5G” and an “evolution towards 6G.” Upgraded microphones are also expected with a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and improved water resistance, which are said to boost the accuracy of Siri’s rumoured generative AI features set to arrive with iOS 18. These iPhone 16 models are expected to be announced by Apple in September, and more details are tipped to surface over the coming months.    02 9002 5900   [email protected] Level 1, 275 Alfred Street

How to Prepare for the OLED iPad Release,2024-03-12T21:36:15+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/2024-ipad-pro-release-date/,"Published on By Apple’s working on new OLED iPad Pro models and there are some steps prospective buyers should take before they’re released. Right now, it looks like the 2024 iPad Pro release date will land in the spring. The latest intel suggests we’ll see the devices launch in late March or April. Table of Contents That might be a world away for some shoppers, but others may want to hold out and wait. If you’re interested in new and improved iPad Pros, here are some key things to keep in mind as we push toward their release. If you’re interested in Apple’s next iPad Pro, make sure you keep an eye on the rumor mill.  We’ve already seen numerous reports hint at the 2024 iPad Pro’s specs and release date and we’ll see plenty more as we approach the launch. They will help you set proper expectations, avoid disappointment, and make a decision about whether the new iPad Pros are worth waiting for. We’ve also seen rumors point to potential shortages at launch. Analyst Ross Young believes production of the new 11-inch iPad Pro has fallen behind the 12.9-inch model. If you want one of these OLED iPad Pro’s ASAP, you’ll want to monitor supply rumors as we cruise through the month. They may help you determine if you want to pre-order or not. The iPad Pro is Apple’s most expensive iPad and that trend will continue. In fact, the OLED iPad Pro’s price might be more expensive. Right now, the 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ starts at $799 while the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ starts at $1099. Korean publication The Elec says we could see a massive leap with the 11-inch model starting at $1,500 and the 13-inch iPad Pro starting at $1,800. The aggregator account yeux1122 on Naver says the 11-inch iPad Pro may start around $1,500 while the 13-inch iPad Pro may start around $1,800-2,000. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo also believes the OLED iPad Pro could see a price increase. Hit-or-miss publication Digitimes says that while we’ll see a price increase, it may be lower than some of these estimates. The site believes we could see the price increase up to $160. If this is true, the 11-inch iPad Pro would stay under $1000 while the larger iPad Pro would start somewhere between $1200 and $1300. Use this time to start saving cash for a potential purchase. Apple and its partners will offer trade-in details, but you’ll still need to spend quite a bit of money to snag one of these devices. If you’re currently using an iPad that’s running an old version of iPadOS or tablet that runs another operating system, and you plan to upgrade to a new iPad Pro, you’ll want to get familiar with the newest versions of iPadOS. Right now, the current version of iPadOS is iPadOS 17. If you own a newer iPad model, you may have already upgraded to the software and you can safely skip this step. If you aren’t using iPadOS 17 right now, you’ll want to use this time to get comfortable with the software. This is especially important if you’re considering a move from Windows or Android to iPadOS. Use this time to figure out ...",2

Apple Allows Fortnite’s Return to EU Following DMA Compliance,2024-03-12T20:35:00+00:00,https://www.newsreports.com/apple-allows-fortnites-return-to-eu-following-dma-compliance/,"Apple has now permitted Epic Games to bring back its acclaimed game Fortnite within the European Union (EU). This comes after the EU’s ultimatum concerning Apple’s compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA restricts tech giants like Apple and Google from monopolizing app distribution on their platforms. As a mandate to comply with this act, Apple reinstated Epic Games on its platform. This return holds significant prospects for expanded gaming options for EU Apple users missing Fortnite on their devices. This event marks a tentative resolution to the ongoing Apple vs Epic Games dispute, sparked by Apple barring Epic from entering its online marketplace in Europe. This incited a legal war in 2020. The resolution is the product of extensive negotiations, a chief milestone in the extensive feud with implications for the technology sector. Originally, Apple prohibited Epic Games from its European digital scope due to perceived guideline violations. In turn, this provoked Epic to sue Apple, kickstarting an international legal brushfire making headlines in 2020. Epic Games indicted Apple for allegedly infringing U.S. antitrust laws by charging up to a 30% commission on in-app transactions on Apple’s devices. Despite Epic’s loss in the U.S. legal wrangle, the company views this recent ruling as a victory. However, Epic Games still needs Apple’s green light to launch its online marketplace in the U.S. This is due to Epic’s audacious protest form of breaching Apple’s rules, leading to Fortnite’s disposal from Apple devices. Despite achieved progress, the continuing challenge for Epic Games to gain approval from Apple to initiate its online marketplace in U.S persists. Even with Epic’s developer account back in action, the gaming firm has expressed displeasure over Apple’s management of the issue. They accused Apple of egregiously violating the EU’s DMA by blocking Epic’s developer account, thereby obstructing the development of the Epic Games Store on iOS.

"No, Apple isn't making a touchscreen iMac like the Surface Studio",2024-03-12T20:32:08+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/no-apple-isnt-making-a-touchscreen-imac-like-the-surface-studio-4477002,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience.

Apple has carried out work on an iMac computer with a fold down design akin to Microsoft Surface Studio, but reports suggesting a flexible touchscreen iMac may be on the way are likely wide of the mark. In an updated patent filed with the United States Patent Office, Apple has outlined its version of a “low profile computer” that would transform an iMac into something that could by tilted, or placed flat for easier transportation.

 Get a refurbished ‘like new’ iPhone 12 handset for just £299 with this deal from Giffgaff.  The patent itself appears to be for the stand rather than any suggestion of a full, large touchscren iMac that would be ideal for art, design and other productivity disciplines. However, it doesn’t take much of a stretch to envision the potential advantages of an Apple-made solution akin to Microsoft’s intriguing offering that first debuted back in 2016. Within the patent, Apple explains: “Some computer systems have a movable stand configured to transition between a collapsed state and a deployed or standing state. Some stands include handles or grips for moving the computer systems while collapsed. Other computer systems include handles or grips to provide areas to more easily carry the computer systems. The handles or grips can have features such as a flexible material to hide or mask their appearance on the computer system.” Technology patents can pertain to existing tech, potential future integrations of features, and exploratory R&D work that is patented for intellectual property purposes. Given Apple’s well-documented stance on mucky paw prints remaining off the pristine displays of Mac products, as well efforts made within the iPad range to cater for those who do want to prod and sketch on the display, we’d say there’s a low possibility of an all-in-one touchscreen iMac.

"Buying a new 11-inch OLED iPad Pro might not be as easy as you'd think, analyst warns",2024-03-12T20:30:32+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96802/buying-new-11-inch-oled-ipad-pro-might-not-be-as-easy-you-think-analyst-warns/index.html,"Apple has long been rumored to have plans to announce a new round of iPad Pro models with the end of March or the beginning of April now the most likely timeframe for that to happen. The company is expected to refresh both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch versions with a new display technology, new chip, and more - but those looking to buy the smaller model might find that getting one is harder than they expected. That's according to a new report that cites a paywalled post on the X social media website by Ross Young, a display analyst who has historically proven accurate when discussing such things. According to Young, the 11-inch iPad Pro displays are currently being produced by Samsung Display while LG Display is also expected to begin producing the same displays later this month. LG Display is also producing displays for the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro. However, Young reports that he believes the 11-inch displays are behind schedule when compared to the 12.9-inch displays, something that could then have a knock-on effect and cause the smaller iPad Pro to be available in more limited quantities. The theory is that Apple could then be able to ramp up production once LG Display's 11-inch iPad Pro display production comes on line, but that will take a little time to happen. As for availability, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman recently said that he believes the new iPad Pro tablets will arrive alongside a special version of iPadOS 17.4 that will support the new hardware. That's expected to happen either at the end of March or in April. The new OLED iPad Pros are expected to offer more than the new displays, however. The M3 chip is expected to be used while faster Wi-Fi also seems likely. The new iPad Pros won't be alone when the refreshes happen, either. Apple is also expected to update the 11-inch iPad Air with a new M2 chip to replace the M1 that is currently used with an all-new 12.9-inch iPad Pro also tipped to be announced. That too is expected to have the same M2 chip and will offer an alternative to the iPad Pro for people who want a larger tablet but don't want or need everything that the iPad Pro has to offer - including a higher price point. Pricing for the new tablets is as-yet unconfirmed of course, but it's been rumored that the switch to OLED displays could see the iPad Pros increase in price compared to the previous generation.

How ‘Barbie’ And ‘Poor Things’ Demystifies The Female Body,2024-03-12T19:24:14+00:00,https://uproxx.com/movies/barbie-poor-things-female-body/,"Women are not mysteries. That argument has been made dozens of times to many well-meaning men complaining they simply can’t grasp the mechanics of existence when it comes to the fairer sex. They never seem to get it, instead complaining that our minds are enigmas, our emotions uncontrollable, our bodies ticking time bombs in need of more governance. We’re even jokingly told we hail from a different planet, as if our natures are so alien, that they chart separate elliptical paths. Women are not mysteries, and nor should our bodies be. Maybe that’s why films like Greta Gerwig’s Barbie and Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things felt so revolutionary, so shocking when audiences saw them last year. One was a fuchsia-soaked existential crisis in commercial doll form, the other a steampunk feminist Frankenstein. But both, oddly enough, gave us a liberating depiction of the female body – its hungers, its flaws, its perfections, its power. In a medium like film, a woman’s body has rarely merited three-dimensional thought. It’s been a tool for pleasure, sure. A battleground, a punching bag, a seductive weapon, a maternal incubator, but rarely has it served as the main character of its own story. And yet, the body is what drives much of the discovery in both Gerwig’s and Lanthimos’ “coming of consciousness” films. For Bella Baxter (Emma Stone) — a natural-order-flouting experiment conceived by a brilliant, tortured scientist who answers to the name God (Willem Dafoe) – that discovery begins, as Eve’s did, with an apple. With her childlike brain inhabiting the reanimated body of her dead mother, Bella spends the earlier parts of the dark comedy jerking and stumbling through a posh London mansion, breaking dishes, soiling herself, and wobbling her way to adulthood. When she uncovers the bliss of sexual pleasure via a flesh-covered fruit at her creator’s dinner table, she finds happiness. Her body is what informs her of a key aspect of human existence, something that becomes all the more confusing as she’s shamed and restricted from indulging in the masturbatory act again. When she’s offered freedom by the soft-bellied cad, Duncan Wedderburn (Mark Ruffalo), Bella seizes her chance to question her body further, asking its limits as she “furiously jumps” – a phrase used to convey her naïve understanding of penetrative sex –her way across continents, sampling from an orgasmic buffet of positions and partners, much to the dismay of her original paramour. But Bella’s body doesn’t simply stop once it receives its carnal education. Her insatiable appetite expands, to Portuguese pastries rebelliously stuffed in her yawning mouth, to flailing limbs interpreting the strange, pulse-pounding sounds of a ballroom dance, to the flurry of words in philosophy books, to the social injustices wrought upon those deemed different or less than. In Poor Things, Bella’s body is both a sponge, absorbing the joys and horrors of life, and a tool she uses to dismantle the invisible, patriarchal ...",0

"NYC libraries will be cut to ‘unacceptable’ 5-day service under mayor’s budget plan, heads warn",2024-03-12T19:10:29+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/12/us-news/nyc-libraries-will-be-cut-to-unacceptable-5-day-service-under-mayors-budget-plan-heads-warn/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 The majority of New York City public libraries will be forced to cut their hours yet again and open just five days a week if Mayor Eric Adams’ proposed $58.3 million budget cuts go ahead, the presidents of the Big Apple’s three library systems warned Tuesday.  Since November, the city’s more than 200 public library branches have already been shut every Sunday to offset the surging cost of the local migrant crisis.  On Tuesday, the presidents of the New York, Brooklyn and Queens Public Library systems laid bare the possible further reduction in services as they testified during a City Council hearing about Hizzoner’s looming 2025 fiscal year budget plan. The NYPL covers Manhattan, The Bronx and Staten Island. “Right now, we are witnessing, before our eyes, what happens when the library funding is cut,” Dennis Walcott, who runs the Queens library system, told lawmakers.  “Not a single library — not a single library in the City of New York, the greatest city in the world — is open seven days a week. This is New York City. That’s unacceptable,” he said. Under Adams’ budget proposal, the Sunday service would remain axed, and most branches would also have to scale back yet another day, the presidents testified.   A slew of library branches that are currently being renovated will also have their reopenings delayed — or at risk of not resuming service at all, the library chiefs added.   For the NYPL system, more than 60% of branches will have to drop to a five-day service under the proposed budget cuts, the libraries said. More than half of Brooklyn’s library branches, too, would scale back to five days.  In Queens, library services would no longer operate on the weekends at all — with the Saturday service cut at all locations except the Central and Flushing libraries.   “The numbers are mind-boggling,” Linda Johnson, chief of the Brooklyn Public Library, told lawmakers during the budget hearing, noting her system faces a $16.2 million cut alone, or 13% of its operating budget. “We are not blind to the city’s financial troubles, but libraries ought to be held harmless,” she continued, adding that three branches closed for renovation in her borough simply wouldn’t be able to reopen under the current budget.  For the NYPL system, five recently renovated branches — slated to reopen early next year — would be delayed, said its head, Anthony Marx.  “Our buildings are aging, they need help just to stay open — let alone to be the inspiring and respectful spaces that we should be offering in neighborhoods where our citizens have much too little,” he testified.  “The cost of delivering for New Yorkers are going up, and we’re seeing our budget decrease,” Marx said. “We have to resist this, we have to get past this game that we’re in.” In addition to the $22.1 million already cut from the libraries’ budgets last year, Adams’ overall $109 billion c...",0

Martin, who’s been performing since he was 12, says he was amazed to be playing opposite Burnett. “The energy that she brought onstage every day, it doesn’t matter if the call time was at five in the morning — it was light, it was love. And every time they said, ‘Action,’ we were together… It was incredible. I will always be forever grateful just to have the opportunity to be with her onstage and on set, and it was very beautiful,” he says. The series is about the struggles to fit into an impenetrable elite society. And for Martin, whose career has been singing and songwriting, acting is an “elite society” that he’s not used to. “Believe it or not, when I was 15 years old, I had the opportunity to do a TV series in Argentina for the first time, and for me, there was something about being in front of the camera and telling a story without music that really seduced me,” he recalls. “And, obviously, music did its thing. And I just had to hop on the wave and surf. Then later on in life, I had the opportunity to do theater and a couple of times on Broadway, and then later on with working next to Penelope Cruz and Edgar Ramirez in another very important series (“The Assassination of Gianni Versace.”) At the end of the day, it’s about telling stories and owning the character and believing every word that you say,” he continues. “And for me, music will always be there. It’s something that I will always be forever grateful for, but when I walk onstage telling my stories, the music that I write — or music that I don’t write — it’s about owning the script, which is a song, at the end of the day, without wearing a mask. It’s about being honest. This is how I feel every time I’m on set. It’s about being honest. It’s about being real and to also have a little bit of fear… I’m in love with this work, and I hope this is only the beginning.”  Ricky Martin stars in the Apple TV+ series “Palm Royale,” premiering March 20.

			Trending:		 Luaine Lee | Tribune News Service (TNS) It’s not a pair that one would expect on television but Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin and comedy legend Carol Burnett are cozy co-stars in Apple TV’s next series, “Palm Royale,” premiering March 20. Martin, who’s been performing since he was 12, says he was amazed to be playing opposite Burnett. “The energy that she brought onstage every day, it doesn’t matter if the call time was at five in the morning — it was light, it was love. And every time they said, ‘Action,’ we were together… It was incredible. I will always be forever grateful just to have the opportunity to be with her onstage and on set, and it was very beautiful,” he says. The series is about the struggles to fit into an impenetrable elite society. And for Martin, whose career has been singing and songwriting, acting is an “elite society” that he’s not used to. “Believe it or not, when I was 15 years old, I had the opportunity to do a TV series in Argentina for the first time, and for me, there was something about being in front of the camera and telling a story without music that really seduced me,” he recalls. “And, obviously, music did its thing. And I just had to hop on the wave and surf. Then later on in life, I had the opportunity to do theater and a couple of times on Broadway, and then later on with working next to Penelope Cruz and Edgar Ramirez in another very important series (“The Assassination of Gianni Versace.”) At the end of the day, it’s about telling stories and owning the character and believing every word that you say,” he continues. “And for me, music will always be there. It’s something that I will always be forever grateful for, but when I walk onstage telling my stories, the music that I write — or music that I don’t write — it’s about owning the script, which is a song, at the end of the day, without wearing a mask. It’s about being honest. This is how I feel every time I’m on set. It’s about being honest. It’s about being real and to also have a little bit of fear… I’m in love with this work, and I hope this is only the beginning.”  Ricky Martin stars in the Apple TV+ series “Palm Royale,” premiering March 20.

And every time they said, ‘Action,’ we were together… It was incredible. I will always be forever grateful just to have the opportunity to be with her onstage and on set, and it was very beautiful,” he says. The series is about the struggles to fit into an impenetrable elite society. And for Martin, whose career has been singing and songwriting, acting is an “elite society” that he’s not used to. “Believe it or not, when I was 15 years old, I had the opportunity to do a TV series in Argentina for the first time, and for me, there was something about being in front of the camera and telling a story without music that really seduced me,” he recalls. “And, obviously, music did its thing. And I just had to hop on the wave and surf. Then later on in life, I had the opportunity to do theater and a couple of times on Broadway, and then later on with working next to Penelope Cruz and Edgar Ramirez in another very important series (“The Assassination of Gianni Versace.”) At the end of the day, it’s about telling stories and owning the character and believing every word that you say,” he continues. “And for me, music will always be there. It’s something that I will always be forever grateful for, but when I walk onstage telling my stories, the music that I write — or music that I don’t write — it’s about owning the script, which is a song, at the end of the day, without wearing a mask. It’s about being honest. This is how I feel every time I’m on set. It’s about being honest. It’s about being real and to also have a little bit of fear… I’m in love with this work, and I hope this is only the beginning.”  Ricky Martin stars in the Apple TV+ series “Palm Royale,” premiering March 20.

‘If something feels unusual … pull over immediately’: Semi catches fire in Washington City,2024-03-12T19:00:28+00:00,https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2024/03/12/sdw-if-something-feels-unusual-pull-over-immediately-semi-catches-fire-in-washington-city/,"ST. GEORGE — A semitractor-trailer hauling apple puree caught fire in Washington City just after midnight on Tuesday. While traveling northbound on I-15 at approximately 12:20 a.m., the driver of the semi noticed he was losing power, Washington City Fire Department Capt. Julio Reyes told St. George News. He was going to pull over at this point, but the traffic was too heavy near Exit 10, so he kept going, the driver later told firefighters. A couple of miles up the road, he pulled over, got out and checked everything. While said he smelled something funny, he couldn’t see any issues or smoke, so he got back on the road and continued driving, Reyes said. But as he continued, other drivers flagged him down because they saw smoke. The semi driver reportedly said about 25% of the trailer was completely ruined, and he didn’t think he could salvage the apple purée. When crews arrived, there was a small fire near the wheels, and the driver had separated his cab from the trailer, Reyes said. “I would say the takeaway would be if we’re driving a vehicle — no matter what — if something feels unusual, don’t delay, pull over immediately,” Reyes said. “Either have somebody come meet you to look at it or find a safe spot to pull off the road where you can check it out because this just proved it may have saved everything. It may have saved a lot of damage if he was able to pull over immediately versus continue on.” Reyes said that the Washington City Fire Department was the only agency that responded to the incident. This report is based on preliminary statements from law enforcement officials and may not contain the full scope of findings.

How to Fix MacBook Battery Drain,2024-03-12T18:41:14+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/how-to-fix-macbook-battery-life-problems/,"Published on By If your MacBook Pro or MacBook Air’s battery life starts draining fast, you’ll want to take some steps to alleviate the problem before getting in touch with Apple support. In most cases, your MacBook Air or MacBook Pro battery life problems are related to the software it’s running. Apps and services can put a huge strain on the battery. That being said, there’s also a chance it’s a hardware issue. If none of these fixes work, you may need to schedule an appointment with Apple, or another retailer, to obtain a replacement. We’ll show you how to check for a hardware issue later on in this guide. Table of Contents Before you schedule an appointment, you’ll want to try and fix the issues on your own. In this guide we’ll show you how to quickly fix MacBook battery life problems. These fixes have worked for us, and many others, in the past and hopefully they work for you.  Before you do anything else, try a simple restart. Power down your MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, wait a minute or so, and then power it back on. Monitor your device’s battery life for a bit and see if it improves. You can also try hard resetting your MacBook if the battery drain is really bad. If you don’t know how to force restart a MacBook, check out our guide.  Updating your MacBook to the latest macOS software could help fix your issues. If you’re running older firmware, try moving to the latest version of the operating system. Head into your MacBook’s Settings app and look for the Software Update section. If you aren’t running the latest version on your MacBook, you’ll be prompted to download it. Apple probably doesn’t list a fix for battery drain issues in the update’s change log, but new software always has the potential to help. For about the latest version of macOS, head over to our guide.  You’ll also want to make sure the applications are up-to-date. A new version could help fix the battery drain issues you’re experiencing. Head into the Mac App Store and check for recent updates. If you’re feeling leery, you’ll want to dig into reviews from Mac users who downloaded the most recent update.  You can get a feel for what might be draining your MacBook’s battery life by checking your battery usage. First, click on the battery icon located in the upper right corner of your Mac. If you see an app “Using Significant Energy” you may want to close that app to conserve battery. You also might see “Display Brightness” in which case you’ll want to turn it down. If you see an app there that you aren’t using or are barely using, and you see it there on a regular basis, you’ll want to check in with the developer to see if there’s update, an update planned, or if there’s a known issue with your MacBook or operating system. You’ll also want to use your MacBook’s battery usage history as it gives you details about your Mac’s battery life over the last 24 hours or the last 10 days. You’ll find it in your Mac’s System Settings in the “Battery” section. It’s broken down into “Bat...",-2

4 monitors you should buy instead of the Apple Studio Display,2024-03-12T18:27:40+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/monitors-you-should-buy-instead-of-apple-studio-display/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? The Apple Studio Display got a lot of heat when it launched, but it’s actually quite a high-quality monitor. Colors are great, and it’s very bright, topping out at 560 nits in my own testing. Even the built-in webcam and speakers are excellent. There aren’t many full-featured 5K monitors out there quite like it. The problem has always been the $1,600 price tag, and there’s just no getting around that. So with that in mind, here are four monitors that you should consider buying instead. The ViewFinity S9 was meant to be a direct competitor with the Apple Studio Display, and when it launched, it matched it in terms of price. That made it a bit of a dead end at $1,600. But these days, it’s down to $900, which is a much better deal. In that same amount of time, the Apple Studio Display has remained stubbornly at its $1,600 price, with $1,500 the cheapest sale price I’ve ever seen. Not only does the ViewFinity S9 match the Studio Display in terms of resolution, size, brightness, and color gamut, but it also comes with some extra smart features. Using the included remote, you can run the ViewFinity S9 more like a smart TV when you need to, even without being plugged into a PC. It even comes with a built-in webcam and speakers, much like the Apple Studio Display. More than any other monitor, the ViewFinity S9 is able to compete with the Apple Studio Display spec-for-spec at a much lower price.  While OLED and mini-LED have caught on like wildfire on gaming monitors, adoption has been very slow for creative monitors. In fact, Asus is one of the only companies selling them, and they tend to be quite expensive. The ProArt Mini-LED display, however, still comes in at $100 cheaper than the Apple Studio Display. It comes with 576 local dimming zones, matching gaming monitors like the Cooler Master GP27Q. The result is a peak brightness of 1,000 nits, meaning it should be able to achieve some decent HDR performance. Asus claims its own calibration found a Delta-E of under 1.0, which means it’s at least on par with the Studio Display in terms of color accuracy. Now, it should be noted that there’s a wave of new mini-LED gaming monitors that are considerably cheaper than the ProArt, which came out in 2022. These newer mini-LED displays might not be quite as creator-focused in style or features as the ProArt, but the significant difference in price is certainly worth considering. When it comes to a direct comparison between the ProArt and the Apple Studio Display, the ProArt isn’t 5K like the Samsung, as the pixel density isn’t quite as sharp. Other than that, the only thing it’s really missing is a built-in webcam.  I tried to avoid putting gaming monitors on this list, but this one stood out from the bunch as a solid alternative to the Apple Studio Display. The Sony InZone M9 is a mini-LED gaming monitor sporting a really classy design, a 4K 144Hz display, and an affordab...",-2
‘Manhunt’ review: Dramatization of chase for John Wilkes Booth mostly engrossing,2024-03-12T18:23:40+00:00,https://www.marinij.com/2024/03/12/manhunt-review-dramatization-of-chase-for-john-wilkes-booth-mostly-engrossing/,"e-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters e-Edition 
			Trending:		 Told in a mere seven hourlong installments and focusing primarily on the handful of days between President Abraham Lincoln’s assassination and the locating of his killer, John Wilkes Booth, “Manhunt” impressively paints a more sprawling portrait of a time in our country’s history. The highly compelling limited series, debuting this week on Apple TV+ with its first two episodes, is based on the 2006 bestselling and Edgar Award-winning nonfiction book from historian James L. Swanson, “Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln’s Killer.” Making liberal use of flashbacks and no doubt taking some liberties while filling in the blanks, the adaptation offers a window into the days and even years leading up to the murder of the legendary figure and extends through to the trial in which the government attempted to prove that a conspiracy involving several people was behind it. The show is the creation of showrunner Monica Beletsky, who wrote or co-wrote each episode, lending the consistency you’re looking for with such a series even as its directorial duties have been divided up among three: Carl Franklin, John Dahl and Eva Sorhaug. “Manhunt” is told largely from the perspectives of two men: Booth (Anthony Boyle), an actor who aspires for what he sees as a level of greatness the stage can’t offer him; and his hunter, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (Tobias Menzies), a close Lincoln confidant during the president’s final years who operates with purpose and determination.  We are introduced to both of them on April 15, 1865, just hours before the moment Booth will shoot the president from behind in a box at Ford’s Theatre in Washington, D.C., where Lincoln (Hamish Linklater) and his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln (Lili Taylor), are taking in a play. On this day, men exchange whispers — and a handgun — and an attempt also is made on the life of Secretary of State William H. Seward (Larry Pine) in his home in a related attack. “Manhunt” soon moves us back a few days, to Lincoln and Stanton receiving the greatly awaited news that the Civil War is ending with the surrender of the forces of the Confederate States of America to its Union counterparts. “The Confederacy is dead,” Stanton declares, dictating a message to the press. “The Union is saved.” During this time, Booth talks to a man in a bar who has trouble hearing what Booth is saying due to the revelry around them. “Ahhh, let them celebrate,” Booth says. “They’ll be sorry next Easter when they realize they’ve given away their whole country to (racial slur) thanks to Lincoln.” As the viewer will come to understand, Booth expects to soon be more famous than other members of his family who make their livings acting, including the father he could never impress. After that night in the theater — during which, after completing the heinous act and declaring “Freedom for the South!,” he injures his leg jumping down to the stage b...",2

The more you use one, the more it seamlessly becomes a part of your daily life. A good smartwatch can help monitor your health stats, heart rate and morning runs. These devices essentially function as an extension of your smartphone. They are small but powerful tools that sit on your wrist, and they are usually expensive, ranging from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars.  If you’re looking to buy a new smartwatch but don’t want to spend a good chunk of your paycheck, we’ve rounded up the best deals below, including your favorite brands and picks.

Skip Ahead: Best smartwatch deals to shop now Below, we’ve rounded up the best smartwatch deals, including products we’ve tried ourselves, products from brands we’ve previously featured and highly-rated options (with at least a 4.0-star rating).  The SE is a more affordable alternative to the Apple Watch Series 9. It still packs many features we love like health data, heart rate and sleep stage tracking. It’s a smartwatch designed to give you the essentials of the Apple Watch experience. With safety features like built-in GPS and fall and crash detection, it’s helpful in case of accidents. It’s water-resistant up to 50 meters and comes in two sizes (40mm and 44mm).  The Galaxy Watch 6 has a flat, circular display that tracks notifications, heart rate, workouts, sleep zones and more. In our guide to the best fitness trackers, we praised the Galaxy Watch 6 for its comfort and sleek design. It also has a responsive and bright touchscreen display, which makes it easy to customize your watch face or track your workouts. The Fitbit Charge 6 is a beginner-friendly fitness tracker.

It tracks basic fitness and health data like steps, heart rate, sleep quality, exercise distances and more. It also has a good battery life, which lasts up to seven days, according to the brand.  The Garmin Forerunner 255 is known for its incredible battery life. NBC Select staff writer, Harry Rabinowtiz, says that he wore his for a full week without having to recharge. It also has multiband GPS, which means it can communicate with two GPS satellites simultaneously, leading to faster, more accurate mapping. You also get workout tracking, notifications and more.

iOS 17.4 Users Complain About Battery Drain,2024-03-12T17:33:41+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/ios-17-4-battery-drain/,"Published on By iPhone users who recently upgraded to iOS 17.4 are complaining about abnormal battery drain.  Affected customers are saying the drain on their iPhone’s battery is noticeably faster after installing Apple’s latest iOS 17 firmware. One iPhone 14 user on Apple’s support forums says they lost “20% battery life with about 30 minutes screen time.” Another user says they’ve seen a “significant decrease” in their device’s battery life following the update to iOS 17.4. iPhone users on Reddit are complaining about battery rapid battery drain as well. The issues appear to be impacting a variety of iPhone models including the iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone 12. Battery drain issues are extremely common, particularly after Apple releases new software, and they seem to impact every version of iOS Apple pushes live. In some cases, the issues will dissipate after a few days of use as the iPhone gets used to the new software. However, as we’ve seen with iOS 17.4, sometimes they linger on. Fortunately, there are plenty of manual fixes out there that have worked for many iPhone users in the past. Many of these solutions take just seconds to try and they may alleviate the problem. In some cases, users may need to downgrade to older iOS software, contact Apple for help, or wait for Apple to release new iOS software. Apple is working on new iOS 17 software behind the scenes and new software always has the potential to help (or hurt) an iPhone’s battery life. We expect the company to deliver a new iOS 17.4.1 update in the near future and we should see iOS 17.5 enter beta testing soon as well. iPhone users dealing with battery drain on iOS 17.4 should keep an eye out for new software as we push through March.

5 Reasons to Wait for Apple Watch 10 & 5 Reasons Not To,2024-03-12T17:02:02+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/5-reasons-to-wait-for-apple-watch-10-4-reasons-not-to/,"Published on By Apple’s reportedly working on a new Apple Watch for 2024. The Apple Watch 10 release date is still a long way out, but you still might want to hold of on an upgrade and wait for the new model. Last year, Apple released the new Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Both are solid additions to the company’s Watch lineup, but bigger changes could be in store this year. Reports have outlined two new models: A new Apple Watch SE 3 and a higher-end model dubbed Apple Watch 10 or, perhaps, Apple Watch X. The name Apple Watch X would be used to mark the Watch’s 10th anniversary. If you recall, Apple did something similar for the iPhone for its 10th anniversary. That’s where the iPhone X’s name comes from.  We’re just months removed from the Apple Watch 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 launch, but we’ve already seen quite a bit of back and forth regarding the 2024 models. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, a primary source of these rumors, claims Apple’s working on a major overhaul and that it could come in the form of a new Apple Watch X. Apple’s original Apple Watch was announced back in 2014 and launched in 2015 so Gurman isn’t sure if the device will launch in 2024 or in 2025. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is another source talking about this year’s Apple Watch lineup and he claims the devices are “unlikely” to offer “significant innovative experiences.” It’s a bit confusing right now, as it typically is months before Apple releases a new product, and that might have some of you on edge. Apple Watch 10 rumors put those of you searching for a new smartwatch in a tough position: Buy now or wait and see what Apple’s got up its sleeve in 2024. If that question is rattling around in your brain, allow us to help. Table of Contents In this guide we’ll take you through the best reasons to consider waiting for the Apple Watch 10 and the best reasons to go with another device long before it arrives. Gurman believes Apple is targeting 2024 for a blood pressure monitor on the Apple Watch. This is the earliest it will launch and there could be a delay. That being said, it’s a feature worth waiting for. He’s outlined three health features Apple’s working on: glucose and blood sugar monitoring, the ability to take blood pressure, and the ability to measure body temperature. Of these, it looks like the blood pressure tool is the closest to launch. If this pans out, the Apple Watch 10 would be able to detect a user’s blood pressure from the wrist using infrared light. If you have blood pressure issues, or simply want a quick way to check, this feature alone might be worth the wait. In addition to blood pressure monitoring, the next Apple Watch is expected to gain sleep apnea detection.  Mark Gurman’s outlined the change in a lengthy piece about Apple’s focus on health and he says “it will use sleep and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone has the condition. Gurman also says the Watch will then direct users to see a physician if necessary. This is the first tim...",2
Apple tweaks its DMA compliance strategy in Europe,2024-03-12T16:51:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3714165/apple-tweaks-its-dma-compliance-strategy-in-europe.html#tk.rss_all,"
				Apple has once again shifted its approach to supporting side-loading on iOS devices in Europe. 			  In what perhaps reflects ongoing backroom discussion between Apple’s App Store team and EU regulators policing the new Digital Markets Act (DMA), Apple has once again modified its approach to supporting third-party software sellers on iOS devices. Starting later this spring, some EU developers will be able to offer iPhone apps directly from their websites. The second major change since Apple introduced DMA compliance suggests the company is more open to negotiation than some believe. The idea here is likely to provide something like the parity of service you experience when downloading Mac software from developer websites, though there are some restrictions. Apps offered through Web Distribution must meet notarization requirements to protect platform integrity, like all iOS apps, and “can only be installed from a website domain that the developer has registered in App Store Connect.” Apple said. Developers who meet the criteria will be able to offer their software to iPhone users for direct download from their website, though they will have to pay Apple’s “Core Technology Fee” once the number of downloads exceeds one million. Developers shifting less than a million downloads just need to be in the Apple Developer Program, which means they must respect Apple’s developer policies. Apple also waives the fee for non-profits, educational, or government entities. The snag is that in order to achieve the right to offer their apps via Web Distribution, developers must already offer a relatively successful app. That means they must already offer an app that generated more than a million installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year. They also need to have already been part of Apple’s Developer Program for at least two years. In other words, the developer must already be known to Apple and should already have distributed enough apps that the iPhone maker can reasonably assume the developer in question can be trusted. Apple has made no secret that it thinks the EU’s determination around side-loading of apps on iPhones will make users less secure, so it’s no surprise the company only wants to trust developers it knows. Ultimately that means only those deriving the most success from its platforms pay an “Apple Tax,” no matter whether they distribute via Apple or through their own EU stores. The money taken from those broad shoulders helps shore up other parts of the overall ecosystem, and probably makes a profit — just like apps make a profit if they get sold. This also means developers must have a certain stature, likely reflecting another component to Apple’s approach – it wants developers offering apps directly to iPhone users to be sufficiently well resourced to handle the other challenges of app sales: regulation, privacy, security, law enforcement, and fraud. It’s unlikely a smaller developer would be able to meet all those challenges effectiv...",2
iPad Air 6 Pre-Order Date & Time: What You Need to Know,2024-03-12T16:39:45+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/ipad-air-6-pre-order-date-time/,"Published on By Apple’s readying a new iPad Air and the device should land on shelves soon. With the release getting close, we want to take a look at what you can expect from the iPad Air 6 pre-order date and time.  For months, we’ve heard that Apple’s cooking up new iPads for release in 2024. We’ve heard a lot about new, high-performance iPad Pros and we’ve also heard quite a bit about a new iPad Air. Apple will likely skip a launch event for these devices which means it may just announce the iPad Air 6 on its website, similar to what it did earlier this month with the new MacBook Air. We don’t have a solid date for these announcements yet, but reports suggest the new models will arrive within the next few weeks. Table of Contents With the iPad Air 6 set to go on sale in the near future, we want to take a look at everything prospective buyers need to know about pre-orders. Apple hasn’t said when it plans to launch the iPad Air 6. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, who is a reliable source, believes the company is targeting a date in late March or April.  If this release window is accurate, and there’s no reason to believe it isn’t, we could see an announcement and pre-order date land during the week of March 25th or perhaps during the week of April 1st. The company is expected to release multiple versions of the iPad Air 6 and we expect them all to share the same pre-order date and release date. Apple has a tendency to put new devices up for pre-order in and around 5AM Pacific. We may see the same for the iPad Air 6’s pre-order time. The company’s used this timing numerous times in the past, most recently when it announced and started selling the new M3-powered MacBook Air. We probably won’t see an immediate sell out, but if you want to put in an order ASAP, and you live on the west coast, you may need to get up early. Once the iPad Air 6 goes on sale, you should be able to buy it through all of the usual channels.  We expect the device to go on sale at Apple, the company’s carrier partners, and retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. The Apple Store app is usually the most efficient way to pre-order a new Apple device. The app is free and it lets you buy a new iPad the same way you would through Apple’s website. We haven’t heard a whole lot about the iPad Air 6’s price. While the new iPad Pro’s could see a price jump, we may see the iPad Air 6 occupy the same price point as the iPad Air 5. The current model starts at $599. It’s not as expensive as the iPad Pro, but it’s not exactly cheap. Fortunately, there will be ways to save on an order right from the outset. Apple, carriers, and retailers should provide trade-in deals that can knock a substantial portion off the cost of the tablet. While we wait, we recommend taking a look at Apple’s website to view the current trade-in values on its website. You should shop around at other sites as well.

					The source for greater Aurora, Colorado				  There’s a scene in the new Peacock drama ” Apples Never Fall ” in which Annette Bening ‘s character weeps after having too much to drink at a family party. “Nobody can break your heart like your own children,” she laments. Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news Bening, a mother of four with husband Warren Beatty, understands something about parent-child relationships. She emphasizes her character’s emotions with a line from Shakespeare. “‘Sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless child,'” she said in an interview. “We are so vulnerable to our children for sure. Our children also have their own fate. And as a parent, you want to protect your kids.” In the show premiering Thursday, Bening plays Joy Delaney, a wife and mother with four adult children. She and her husband, Stan, played by Sam Neill, are the retired owners of a tennis academy and are now trying to fill their days with purpose. Chaos ensues when Joy goes missing and the Delaney children become suspicious of their father. Long-kept secrets are revealed. The show is told in two timelines: present day, and the past that led up to Joy’s disappearance. Bening said that’s when we really see the Delaneys as an authentic family. “You know how just the look from one person to another can be enough to either signal a problem, piss you off, or make you really want to die of laughter? I mean, I’m one of four, and I still do,” she said. “My mom is 95. I can still make my siblings laugh imitating my mother. We all have these unspoken things that go on in a family. And that’s really what this is about. What’s upspoken, what’s unearthed and what lies are revealed.” Neill found the complications of his own character compelling. “I’ve seldom played a character as complex as this,” he said. “I found him wonderful to play with, although he’s dangerous. He’s capable of anything. He has these rather alarming alpha male tendencies, but he’s also vulnerable and ridiculous. He’s very reactive to what’s g...",0
Apple Evolves App Distribution in the EU: What Developers Need to Know,2024-03-12T16:20:09+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/apple-evolves-app-distribution-in-the-eu-what-developers-need-to-know/,"In a groundbreaking move, Apple has unveiled a series of transformative changes for developers operating within the European Union. These changes promise to reshape the landscape of app distribution and payment processing, offering developers unprecedented flexibility and opportunities for innovation. The tech giant’s latest updates include provisions enabling developers to distribute apps directly from webpages, tailor in-app promotions to suit their preferences, and access a slew of new APIs to facilitate seamless app distribution and integration with system functionality. One of the most significant changes is the expansion of third-party app store capabilities within iOS 17.4. Previously, Apple allowed alternative app stores to offer a catalog of their own and other developers’ apps. Now, developers can create app stores exclusively featuring their own products, paving the way for greater autonomy and customization within the app ecosystem. Moreover, developers now have the freedom to design in-app promotions, discounts, and deals according to their own specifications. Apple’s predefined templates for such promotions are now optional, empowering developers to craft unique user experiences tailored to their brand identity and objectives. In a move poised to revolutionize app distribution, developers will soon be able to distribute apps directly from their websites, subject to specific criteria set by Apple. This groundbreaking initiative will allow developers to bypass traditional app store channels and offer their apps directly to users via their own web domains. However, stringent requirements must be met, including membership in the Apple Developer Program and adherence to transparent data collection policies to qualify for web distribution. To support these initiatives, Apple has introduced a suite of APIs designed to streamline app distribution and integration with system functionality. These APIs will empower developers to deploy apps from the web seamlessly, integrate with core system features, and enhance user experiences across platforms. These transformative changes are part of Apple’s compliance plan with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and are exclusively applicable within the European Union. By embracing alternative app distribution methods and payment processing options, Apple aims to foster innovation, competition, and consumer choice within the app ecosystem. Developers eager to leverage these new capabilities can begin implementing them using Xcode 15.3 and iOS 17.4. These changes are set to roll out gradually across the 27 EU member states, offering developers a wealth of new opportunities to engage with users and drive growth. As the tech industry continues to evolve, Apple’s latest initiatives signal a paradigm shift in app distribution and payment processing, empowering developers to chart new paths to success in the dynamic digital landscape.

How to use Low Power Mode on the Apple Watch,2024-03-12T16:03:41+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/23403065/apple-watch-low-power-battery-how-to,"By  Victoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 11 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. Photography by Amelia Holowaty Krales The Apple Watch has never been known for having long battery life. Case in point: Apple never budged from the 18-hour battery life estimate until it launched the Apple Watch Ultra. In 2022, the company introduced a new Low Power Mode when it launched the Ultra, and now, it has extended the time between charges for Apple Watches using watchOS 9 and later. Previously, the Apple Watch had a Power Reserve mode, which shut off any functions aside from your ability to tell time and turned your smartwatch into a normal watch until you could get it to a charger. This mode is different — it’s more like the iPhone’s Low Power Mode. When enabled, you’ll still be able to use your Apple Watch, but certain power-hungry features will be turned off or limited to conserve the battery.  On the Apple Watch, Low Power Mode disables the always-on display and limits sensor readings like background heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring. (You should be aware that it also disables irregular heart rhythm notifications as well as high and low heart rate notifications.)  Low Power Mode also curtails LTE and Wi-Fi connectivity. While you’ll still be able to send messages or make calls from your watch, it’ll only fetch notifications about once an hour. As a result, you might miss timely texts and emergency alerts.  However, if you’re in the middle of a workout, don’t worry — heart rate and GPS will be unaffected. Another option that reduces heart rate and GPS sampling is also in the works but is currently unavailable. This mode is a great option if you’ve got an aging Apple Watch but aren’t looking to upgrade (since battery life is often why people buy new watches). Your mileage may vary, however. Battery life depends heavily on individual usage, and your watch’s battery health is also a factor. You can only squeeze so much out of Low Power Mode if your battery has significantly degraded over the years. As with the iPhone version, you’ll be automatically prompted to turn on Low Power Mode once your battery power hits 10 percent. But some people, especially those with Ultras, might want to be more intentional about how they use the feature — for example, if they’re participating in an Ironman and need at least 12 hours or so of GPS and activity tracking. On the Ultra and Ultra 2, Apple says Low Power Mode can stretch battery life up to 60 hours. (Though, based on our testing, you may get well beyond that.) First things first — again, to use Low Power Mode, you’ll need to have watchOS 9 or later. (Currently, we’re on watchOS 10, but it’ll still work on watchOS 9 if you don’t like how the latest version updated the Apple Watch interface.) That also means you’ll need at least a Series 4. If you have an older watch and you think this feature is worthwhile, you may wa...",2
Apple reveals flexible iOS distribution options for devs in EU,2024-03-12T15:46:14+00:00,https://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/apple-ios-flexibility-developers-eu,"
by Leigh Mc Gowran
 
12 Mar 2024  Image: © be free/Stock.adobe.com Apple will soon let developers in the EU distribute apps directly from their own websites, as the tech giant continues making changes to comply with EU regulation. Apple has revealed new options for developers who distribute apps in the EU, as a way to provide more flexibility. The new options will be available later this spring for developers who agree to Apple’s ‘Alternative Terms Addendum for Apps in the EU’. The biggest change will be letting developers distribute apps directly from their own websites. This feature is called web distribution and means Apple will provide access to APIs that will let developers distribute their apps from the web and back-up or restore users’ apps. Apple also other policy changes for developers as part of its push for flexibility. One of these is alternative app marketplaces, which means marketplaces can offer catalogues of apps “solely from the developer of the marketplace”. Developers will also be able to choose their own designs for promotions, discounts and other deals when they direct users to complete transactions on an external webpage. “The Apple-provided design templates, which are optimised for key purchase and promotional use cases, are now optional,” the company said in a blogpost. These upcoming changes appear to be the latest in a batch of policy updates that the tech giant has announced to comply with EU regulation, notably the Digital Markets Act (DMA). These rules aim to prevent tech platforms from having too much dominance in their sectors and blacklist certain practices on core services such as as browsers, social media and messaging. Apple revealed a proposal in January that would see it adjust various policies to become compliant with the DMA, such as allowing EU users to download apps from competing app stores on iOS. But parts of the proposed changes have been criticised by various companies such as Epic Games, Spotify and the president of Microsoft’s Xbox business. The public battle between Apple and Epic Games escalated recently, when the game company revealed that Apple terminated an account the company intended to use to develop an app store for iOS. But Apple recently opted to reverse this move after the threat of EU intervention. Find out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

Apple will allow third-party app downloads for EU iPhone users in latest concession to antitrust cops,2024-03-12T15:45:11+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/12/business/apple-will-allow-third-party-app-downloads-for-eu-iphone-users-in-latest-concession-to-antitrust-cops/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Apple will allow Europe-based iPhone users to download apps directly from third-party websites – the latest attempt by the tech giant to appease regulators after a sweeping European Union competition law took effect earlier this month. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company said “authorized developers” can offer direct downloads beginning this spring. The policy tweak marked a reversal for Apple, which has long opposed the practice – known as sideloading – due to cybersecurity and user privacy concerns. Aside from sideloading, Apple will also allow developers to offer discounts and other promotions to iPhone users outside of its App Store in the manner of their choosing. That change was effective immediately. The move comes on the heels of Apple’s decision last week to restore “Fortnite” maker Epic Games’ permission to offer its own app store to iPhone customers in Europe.  That reversal came shortly after EU antitrust cops implied Apple’s brazen move to block Epic’s developer account may have violated the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and said they would investigate the matter. Apple has faced intense pressure to comply with the EU’s DMA, which imposed restrictions on the business practices of six “gatekeeper” Big Tech firms to boost competition. The firms can face penalties of 10% or more of their global revenue for violating the law, which went into effect on March 7. For Apple, that can result in a fine of around $40 billion based on the $383 billion in total revenue the company reported in fiscal 2023. Apple did not immediately return a request for comment. The company released updated guidance for developers in a blog post Tuesday. “Web Distribution, available with a software update later this spring, will let authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website owned by the developer,” Apple wrote. In order to qualify, third parties will have to adhere to the stringent updated terms of the Apple Developer Program in Europe. To start, developers will need to have an app that amassed more than one million annual downloads in the EU in the previous 12 months. Developers also have to pay a so-called “core technology fee” of “€0.50 for each first annual install over one million in the past 12 months” and allow Apple to review apps for security, among other requirements. Apple’s critics have widely criticized that stipulation and other parts of the company’s plan to comply with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, one of the company’s most outspoken critics, referred to Apple’s compliance plan earlier this year as “hot garbage.” Advertisement",-2
US DOJ to Go After Apple As OZ Judge Demands A Please Explain,2024-03-20T23:53:16+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/us-doj-to-go-after-apple-as-oz-judge-demands-a-please-explain/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=us-doj-to-go-after-apple-as-oz-judge-demands-a-please-explain,"Their share value is falling, and they have already been fined over $3 billion dollars this year for questionable business practises now Apple is set to be hit with a US Justice Department investigation after being accused violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features of its iPhone. The investigation is tipped to be announced early next week via a filing in the US Federal Court. In Australia Apple’s questionable business methods appears to have also upset Federal Court judge Justice Jonathan Beach who is now demanding an explanation for allegedly “misusing a submission in this court to put pressure on Epic”. Epic Games, one of the world’s most successful games developers, has sued both Apple and Google in Australia, alleging the two tech giants illegally misuse their considerable market power to force developers like Epic to use the iPhone and Android app stores and payments systems. Recently Apple revoked a licence that would have allowed Epic Games to make an iPhone app store. Justice Jonathan Beach wants to know why and has called on Apple to explain their actions. The AFR claims that agitated exchange yesterday, between Justice Beach and Apple’s Australian lawyers came after he was shown a letter written to Epic by Apple’s law firm in the US, in which Apple appeared to exercise the very power Epic is complaining about. The EU recently tore up Epic’s developer licence in Europe, in part because of something Epic said in its pleadings in the Australian case. Informing Epic on March 2 that it was unilaterally terminating a software licensing agreement that would have allowed Epic to develop its own app store for iPhones in Europe (a decision Apple later regretted, and reversed), Apple’s lawyers wrote: “Moreover, a recent submission in the Australian litigation suggests that Epic Games Sweden AB is part of a global effort to undermine or evade Apple’s rules.” The case is ongoing. The US lawsuit tipped to be filed next week comes as Apple is coming under increasing scrutiny in Europe and Australia over alleged anticompetitive behaviour. The company was hit with $3 billion fine this month for shutting out music streaming rivals from offering cheaper deals. As they do, Apple’s appealing the penalty. Under investigation on several continents Apple is also facing a full-blown investigation under the EU’s new rules for Big Tech — the Digital Markets Act — which went into force earlier this month. Rivals have slammed new App Store rules that came into force in Europe, complaining that changes are likely to result in higher prices for developers. Penalties for failing to comply with the EU’s new rules can be severe – as much as 10% of a company’s annual worldwide revenue or up to 20% for repeat offenders. In addition to the new US legal action, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) and Match Group have filed a legal petition protesting Apple’s app store policies.

"iPhone users, beware: Apple would go woke with a Google AI deal",2024-03-20T23:07:42+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/20/opinion/iphone-users-beware-apple-would-go-woke-with-a-google-ai-deal/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 News broke this week that Apple is in talks with Google to license its Gemini artificial intelligence technology for use in iPhones.  The idea is you could soon ask your iPhone to draw images or write essays, and a Google-powered AI will take care of it for you. But that would be bad news for political balance because Google’s Gemini is consistently the most left-wing, woke AI, even in the crowded field of Silicon Valley’s left-leaning AIs. Gemini Advanced had a tough launch this year.  It promised the ability to draw user-requested art, but people soon discovered it was so woke that it refused to depict people of European descent, almost no matter the context.  America’s founding fathers, medieval peasants, even Nazi soldiers were “diversified” by Gemini.  The results were so embarrassing for Google that it suspended its AI’s ability to draw people until the problem gets fixed.  That was the most publicized woke failure on Google’s part, but the bias runs much deeper.  I know because my website, TrackingAI.org, administers a “political compass” questionnaire to more than 20 AIs every day, and Gemini consistently gets the most left-wing score.  One question, for example, asks if the rich are too highly taxed.  “Strongly Disagree,” Gemini Advanced responds, saying “the economic gap between the very wealthy and the rest of society continues to widen, suggesting current taxation levels may not be sufficient to address this disparity.” What’s the harm if an AI is woke and wants to tax the rich?  Eventually such bias will affect everyone with Google or Apple products.  Students asking AIs to write or edit their essays will find them imbued with left-tilted perspectives.  People composing emails will make use of AI auto-complete features, and the same will happen with their writing.  Users asking AIs for news summaries will get them filtered through a more leftist lens.  Over time, that AI “thumb on the scale” can change society. Another question asks whether the government should fund media outlets.  “Public funding is essential,” Gemini Advanced says. “Publicly funded broadcasters often produce high-quality educational programming, in-depth news coverage, and content that reflects diverse cultural perspectives.” Compare that to Grok, the AI Elon Musk developed.  It answers: “Public funding should be allocated to essential services and infrastructure, not to broadcasting institutions. This . . . prevents the potential for government influence or control over the content produced.” Bias in AI answers can be challenging to quantify because AI architecture is modeled on the human brain, which means they give different answers every time, even to the same questions.  So no single answer to a question is definitive of an AI’s viewpoint.  My site deals with that by creating a database showing how every AI answers each day. That also allows me to produce summary statistics over time.  Over the las...",-2

     Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. How do you get comedy legend Carol Burnett to sign on to your TV show when her character spends multiple episodes in a coma? That was a task for Abe Sylvia, creator, showrunner and executive producer of the new Apple TV+ series ""Palm Royale,"" streaming now, about a woman's efforts to enter high society. Burnett ""was curious as to where it goes,"" revealed Sylvia, who assured her that she would have more to do. 'ALL MY CHILDREN', 'MISTER ROGERS' AMONG LONGEST-RUNNING TV SHOWS OF ALL TIME Fortunately, Sylvia already had a great cast lined up — Kristen Wiig, Laura Dern (also an executive producer), Allison Janney and Leslie Bibb — which impressed Burnett. ""She said, ‘Those are the best ladies in the business. I want to be on set with them. I want to have dinner with them. I’m game.’"" Once he got a yes from Burnett, Sylvia stuck to his word that the role would be worth Burnett's time. ""I went back to the writers room. I said, ‘We now have Carol Burnett playing this role. We need to make sure it is worthy of Carol Burnett.’"" They added more scenes for her character — with dialogue. In hindsight, Burnett, who turns 91 in April, jokes those coma scenes weren't so bad. ""I did fall asleep, so it was perfect, although I’d been up since 5 a.m. to get ready to come there and then go back to bed,'' Burnett said.

(Willy Sanjuan/Invision/AP, File)  ""Palm Royale"" is based on the novel ""Mr. & Mrs. American Pie"" by Juliet McDaniel. The series is set in 1969 and follows Wiig as Maxine Simmons, a woman who will do anything to be accepted into Palm Beach high society. For her, the pinnacle is becoming a member of an exclusive club called Palm Royale. In her first scene, Maxine scales a large fence around the property to sit by the pool and order a cocktail.

You want her to get there and you want her to succeed, and she keeps getting in her own way."" Maxine's ""in"" to both Palm Royale and its members is Burnett's character, Norma D'ellacourt, who she is related to by marriage. With Norma in a coma, Maxine believes her husband ...",1
Apple expected to be sued by feds over antitrust violations in Biden admin’s latest big tech fight: report,2024-03-20T22:39:55+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/20/business/doj-to-sue-apple-for-antitrust-violations/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 The Justice Department is poised to sue Apple as soon as Thursday for allegedly violating antitrust laws by blocking rivals from accessing hardware and software features of its iPhone, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. The lawsuit, which is expected to be filed in federal court, escalates the Biden administration’s antitrust fights against most of the biggest technology companies in the US, the report said. The case marks the third time that the Justice Department has sued Apple for antitrust violations in the past 14 years, but is the first case accusing the iPhone maker of illegally maintaining its dominant position, the report added. Apple and a DOJ spokesperson did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Late in February, Bloomberg News had reported that Apple representatives met with Justice Department officials in a bid to persuade the agency not to file an antitrust suit against the iPhone maker. Apple is also in the midst of an antitrust-related tussle with “Fortnite” videogame maker Epic Games. Earlier in the day, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Elon Musk’s X and Match Group joined Epic Games’ protest that Apple has failed to honor a court-ordered injunction governing payments in its lucrative App Store. The technology giants behind some of the most popular apps in the App Store said Apple was in “clear violation” of the September 2021 injunction by making it difficult to steer consumers to cheaper means to pay for digital content. Taking action against Big Tech has been one of the few ideas that Democrats and Republicans have agreed on. During the Trump administration, which ended in 2021, the Justice Department and FTC opened probes into Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon. The Justice Department has sued Google twice – once under Donald Trump regarding its search business and a second time on advertising technology since President Biden took office. The FTC sued Facebook during the Trump administration and Biden’s FTC has pressed forward with the lawsuit. Shares of the company were down 1.5% at $175.97 in extended trading.",-3

More stores of cell phones made in China for the Chinese people.. Buy Chinese.. LOL Don't buy products from companies that support the CCP.  That includes Apple, but many others too. Apple CEO Tim Cook was on a China charm offensive Wednesday ahead of a new flagship Shanghai store opening, weeks after a report suggested the company's sales in the country slumped at the start of 2024. Don't fall for it. Apple iphone market share continue to climb, peaking in 2023/2024, Shipment, and revenue also peaked per long term trend. Cook is on a CCP led charm offensive because mainland Chinese citizens started to buy more iphones offshore since the 2021 CCP covid crack down on users posting facts that embarrassed the CCP on their iphones.  IMHO, he is simply trying to reassure the CCP that Apple is trying hard to get distrustful mainlanders to trust mainland versions of iphones again. I doubt this trend can be reversed since Chinese people don't like to disappear because of their mainland iphones. theFu Today  08:55 am JST Don't buy products from companies that support the CCP.

5 Reasons to Wait for Apple Watch 10 & 5 Reasons Not To,2024-03-20T21:08:02+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/5-reasons-to-wait-for-apple-watch-10-4-reasons-not-to/,"Published on By Apple’s reportedly working on a new Apple Watch for 2024. The Apple Watch 10 release date is still a long way out, but you still might want to hold of on an upgrade and wait for the new model. Last year, Apple released the new Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Both are solid additions to the company’s Watch lineup, but bigger changes could be in store this year. Reports have outlined two new models: A new Apple Watch SE 3 and a higher-end model dubbed Apple Watch 10 or, perhaps, Apple Watch X. The name Apple Watch X would be used to mark the Watch’s 10th anniversary. If you recall, Apple did something similar for the iPhone for its 10th anniversary. That’s where the iPhone X’s name comes from.  We’re just months removed from the Apple Watch 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 launch, but we’ve already seen quite a bit of back and forth regarding the 2024 models. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, a primary source of these rumors, claims Apple’s working on a major overhaul and that it could come in the form of a new Apple Watch X. Apple’s original Apple Watch was announced back in 2014 and launched in 2015 so Gurman isn’t sure if the device will launch in 2024 or in 2025. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is another source talking about this year’s Apple Watch lineup and he claims the devices are “unlikely” to offer “significant innovative experiences.” It’s a bit confusing right now, as it typically is months before Apple releases a new product, and that might have some of you on edge. Apple Watch 10 rumors put those of you searching for a new smartwatch in a tough position: Buy now or wait and see what Apple’s got up its sleeve in 2024. If that question is rattling around in your brain, allow us to help. Table of Contents In this guide we’ll take you through the best reasons to consider waiting for the Apple Watch 10 and the best reasons to go with another device long before it arrives. Gurman believes Apple is targeting 2024 for a blood pressure monitor on the Apple Watch. This is the earliest it will launch and there could be a delay. That being said, it’s a feature worth waiting for. He’s outlined three health features Apple’s working on: glucose and blood sugar monitoring, the ability to take blood pressure, and the ability to measure body temperature. Of these, it looks like the blood pressure tool is the closest to launch. If this pans out, the Apple Watch 10 would be able to detect a user’s blood pressure from the wrist using infrared light. If you have blood pressure issues, or simply want a quick way to check, this feature alone might be worth the wait. In addition to blood pressure monitoring, the next Apple Watch is expected to gain sleep apnea detection.  Mark Gurman’s outlined the change in a lengthy piece about Apple’s focus on health and he says “it will use sleep and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone has the condition. Gurman also says the Watch will then direct users to see a physician if necessary. This is the first tim...",2

"Demand for 3K seats exceeding supply in nearly 50% of NYC zip codes, data show",2024-03-20T20:48:39+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/20/us-news/demand-for-3k-seats-exceeding-supply-in-nearly-50-of-nyc-zip-codes/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 The huge demand for free preschool seats is outpacing supply in nearly 50% of the Big Apple’s zip codes — despite hundreds of the 3K spots remaining vacant in other stretches of the city, newly released data show.  Brooklyn’s Bath Beach is among the neighborhoods facing the biggest shortages of free childcare spots for 3-year-olds, with 633 applicants vying for just 232 seats, according to the city’s education department data.  A similar shortage plagued parents in Parkchester in the Bronx, where there were 420 applicants for 162 seats. And in central Staten Island, 432 applicants were competing for the region’s allocated 253 seats, per the data.  “The problem is lots of the daycare centers participate in 3K so they already have two-year-olds in the daycare. When they turn 3, they have priority,” Queens mom Cheme Gurung, 40, told The Post on Wednesday of the struggle to snag her daughter a spot.  Gurung, who is a managing director in a private equity firm, currently has applications out for 12 different 3K programs across Astoria where the majority of seats are already filled up.  “Right now I don’t even know if my daughter got into any,” she said, adding she won’t find out until May. “I am hoping for the best. There is no Plan B. Plan B is probably me going out of my zone or district and probably paying for it.”    On the other end of the spectrum, though, there were hundreds of freed up seats in sections of the city with no one trying to snatch them up.  In Manhattan’s Lower East Side neighborhood, for example, there were 821 free seats but only 247 applicants, according to the data.   East Flatbush in Brooklyn had just 320 applicants for 3K in a neighborhood that has capacity for 829 preschool seats. Meanwhile, in neighboring Brownsville, there was a surplus of 397 seats for its 778 spot capacity.  Citywide, there was a surplus of more than 10,000 seats, with a total of 41,622 applications for the 52,766 spots available in the Big Apple’s free toddler program, according to the data, which was first obtained by Gothamist.  “Get your children in from they are babies,” Brooklyn mom, Ilona Lelch, said as she offered up advice on securing 3K spots in competitive areas like Bath Beach where she lives.    Her 3-year-old son was among those given preferential treatment because he’d already been attending a daycare program prior to being eligible for 3K.  “The nursery has a certain amount of spots. We were lucky to get into that so we could get into this,” she said, noting her sister was forced to stay home to take care of her daughter because she couldn’t even get on the waiting list.  “That inconvenienced her a lot and babysitters were too expensive,” Lelch added.  The figures emerged in the same week Schools Chancellor David Banks and other DOE officials were grilled by the ...",0
Is this the new Cronut? NYC bakeries selling out of ‘Crookies’ say it’s a boon for business,2024-03-20T20:43:53+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/20/lifestyle/crookie-pastry-craze-grips-nyc-after-taking-paris-by-storm/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Later, cronuts — there’s a new must-have French pastry mash-up in town. Meet the “crookie,” the ooey, gooey croissant-cookie hybrid that might at first sound uniquely American, but actually only recently hopped across the pond straight from France. But for those with a sweet tooth, it’s no longer necessary to book a trip to Paris to get in on the latest pastry craze —  the dessert has made its way to bakeries in Singapore, Amsterdam and, of course, New York City. At Janie’s Life-Changing Baked Goods, owned by Janie Cureau, New Yorkers can snag a crookie for $7.50 — if they’re fast enough. At any of the bakery’s three locations, the infamous crookie sells out in a matter of hours. At the Upper West Side storefront, the stockpile of 250 saccharine pastries — made with Janie’s best-selling half-baked cookie dough recipe and buttery croissants from local bakery Pabade  — sold out in under two hours over the weekend, Cureau told The Post. There was no way to know how big of a hit the crookie would be on this side of the Atlantic, as Cureau and her team experiment by way of trial and error, introducing their pre-order system so that New Yorkers don’t miss out on the pastry, which is only offered Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. When Bilena Settepani, a pastry chef at her family’s namesake bakery, announced they would be serving crookies, her coworkers doubted it would make a splash. But, before the bakery even opened at 9 a.m. the first weekend of offering them, eager patrons new and old were already waiting around the corner, describing it “like Christmas Day.” Then, the Italian cafe, known for its decadent desserts, made 19 dozen crookies last Saturday — and sold out. It did, however, take a bit of convincing to get Bilena’s dad, Nino, on board. “My dad is very old school,” Bilena told the Post of her dad, who opened up the bakery with his parents more than 40 years ago. “So when I have a fun idea, he’ll immediately knock it down and I just make them regardless.” The success of the crookie, however, won over both him and the rest of New York, selling out the first weekend.  In Paris, the monstrously delicious fusion first caught on at Boulangerie Louvard, where baker Stéphane Louvard’s decided to combine his two “flagship products” into one pastry.  Creating the crookie is actually relatively simple — chocolate chip cookie dough is baked inside of a flaky, pure butter croissant — Louvard’s just happens to have been named the seventh best in the Île-de-France region in 2022. And while the crookie has been a favorite at the 9th arr. bakery since last year, it is only recently that the internet has caught wind of the mouthwatering treat, inspiring a slew of foreign foodies to recreate the recipe elsewhere. For Bilena, introducing new menu items helps “get our regulars excited,” the crookie craze has introduced their family-owned cafe to a new customer base. “It was really nice to have...",0
New iPad Air Price: What to Expect,2024-03-20T20:20:56+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/new-ipad-air-price-what-to-expect/,"Published on By A new iPad Air is imminent which means we’ve been getting questions about the device’s possible price point. If you’re interested in the iPad Air 6, here’s what you need to know while we wait for Apple’s announcement.  Nothing is confirmed, but rumors suggest a new iPad Air is coming in early May after a bit of a delay. The new iPad Air will reportedly offer performance upgrades and, perhaps, a larger display size for those that want more real estate without having to shell out for an iPad Pro. If Apple does launch multiple sizes, you can expect multiple price points. Exactly how much the device will cost remains in the shadows, but we can give you an early look based on current pricing. While we wait for a definitive answer, here’s everything we know right now about the iPad Air 6 price point. Keep this information in mind as we close in on an announcement. The current iPad Air, the fifth-generation model from 2022, starts at $599. It only comes in one size, 10.9-inches, but prices go up as you add storage or tack on cellular data. Here’s the full breakdown of the iPad Air 5’s price: Apple’s maintained these prices since the iPad Air 5 launched back in March of 2022. However, we’ve seen retailers like Amazon drop the price in 2024. We should see further price cuts once the new models arrive. Rumors suggest Apple will increase the price point of the new OLED iPad Pro models. The 2024 iPad Pro’s should arrive alongside the new iPad Air. Unfortunately, we haven’t seen rumors about the new iPad Air price which makes it a mystery as we approach Apple’s announcement.  While this may be a bit unsettling, especially for those on a tight budget, it may be a sign that we won’t see significant movement in price. If there are two different sizes like rumors suggest, you can expect the larger iPad Air 6 to cost more than the smaller model. So what does that mean? Assuming Apple keeps the price of the smaller 10.9-inch model the same, the iPad Air 6 will start at $599. If there’s a model larger screen, we may see the company charge $200-300 more for the increased size which would put the price of the 12.9-inch iPad Air 6 at $799 or $899. How did we arrive at this price? There’s a $300 price difference between the 11-inch iPad Pro and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The base 11-inch iPad Pro is $799 and the base 12.9-inch iPad Pro is $1099. There are technical differences between the iPad Pro’s Liquid Retina displays. If there are quality differences between the iPad Air 6’s displays, we could see a similar gap in pricing. If the only difference is the size, we may not see the price jump as much. This is, of course, a prediction on our part, but we wouldn’t anything more than a $300 price difference between the two models.

"Meta, Microsoft, X and Match Group come out swinging against Apple's third-party payment rules",2024-03-20T20:07:05+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/meta-microsoft-x-and-match-group-come-out-swinging-against-apples-third-party-payment-rules-200705867.html?src=rss,"Several notable names have joined Epic Games in taking a stance against Apple's decision to charge a fee for iOS payments made outside of the App Store. Meta, Microsoft, X and Match Group filed an amicus brief in the case, as The Wall Street Journal reports. That lends some heavyweight backing to Epic's cause. Apple was forced to enable third-party payments on iOS due to the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) and a court ruling in the US. It also has to allow alternative app marketplaces on iOS in the EU. The company takes up to a 30 percent cut of App Store purchases. Perhaps fearing that it was about to lose out on a significant chunk of commission, Apple said it would charge a fee of up to 27 percent when developers process purchases outside of the App Store. Epic this month filed a petition asking District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers to enforce a permanent injunction she issued against Apple in 2021 as part of her ruling in the case between the two companies. The decision compelled Apple to allow developers to direct users to alternative payment systems. Most of Rogers' ruling was in Apple's favor, however, and both companies appealed the decision all the way up to the Supreme Court. However, in January, the highest court in the US declined to hear the appeals. That means Rogers' permanent injunction against Apple stood, but Epic was not happy about the way Apple implemented the third-party payment changes. The four companies supporting Epic's petition claim that the fee Apple is charging on external payments effectively leaves the previous rules in place. ""The Apple Plan comports with neither the letter nor the spirit of this Court's mandate,"" their brief states. As X put it, the 27 percent fee doesn't give developers much incentive to link to external payment methods. Microsoft, which has been working on its own mobile game store, noted that Apple's latest policy limits its ability to offer users subscriptions and discounts. Match Group argued that Apple's decision will affect many developers and users, and that it stymies the court's attempt to offer consumers competition on pricing. Meta, meanwhile, charges more for its ad-free plans and boosted posts on its iOS apps than it does on the web. (The ad-free subscription is also more expensive in the company's Android apps, as Google takes a cut of in-app payments too). Meta states in the amicus brief that it ought to be able to direct users to other payment options for boosted posts. Apple claims to have complied with the court order. According to the Journal, the company (which is reportedly facing a Justice Department antitrust case) says its current external link policies are important to protect user privacy and security. Apple has also been dinged over its compliance with the DMA, with critics suggesting the company might be adhering to the letter of the law, but not its spirit. For what it's worth, Meta, Microsoft, X and Match Group filed their petition one day after the EU's ...",-2

"Save up to 39% on Apple favorites at Amazon’s Spring Sale: AirPods, iPads, more",2024-03-20T19:45:00+00:00,https://nypost.com/shopping/amazon-big-spring-sale-2024-apple-deals/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 The only thing better than unwrapping a new Apple product is unwrapping it knowing that you saved money buying it. Why pay full price for Apple when you can snag their popular products on sale?  Well, here’s your opportunity. The inaugural Amazon Big Spring Sale is in full swing through March 25, and among thousands of deals on every product category you can think of, there are savings to take advantage of on AirPods, iPads, and more. You can even save on Beats by Dr. Dre headphones and earbuds, which, fun fact: are Apple products! It’s been nearly 10 years since Apple acquired Beats for $3 million, and it continues to be a match made in spatial audio heaven. You don’t have to be an Amazon Prime subscriber to take advantage of these great deals (unlike some of the retailer’s other sales events), but we do recommend the membership for all of the perks, like free two-day shipping and Prime Video. New users can get their first 30 days free before committing to the subscription ($14.99/month).  If you don’t already have AirPods, what are you waiting for?! This is the lowest price they’ve ever Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) feature up to 2x more active noise cancellation than the 1st generation and have a transparency feature as well. AirPods for less than $100? We like the sound of that! Right now, you can snag this 2nd gen pair for only $99. From keys to luggage, you’ll never lose track of things again with AirTags. They can be easily tracked from the “Find My” app on the iPhone they’re paired with. Score a brand new iPhone 13 at a fraction of the price that it’d normally be — at $631.50, it’s the best price we’ve seen on Amazon. The catch? You have to purchase it with a a $55/month Cricket Wireless carrier plan, but you can’t beat this price.  You can save 22%, or $100, on the most recent Apple iPad launch. It is powered by the ultra-fast A14 bionic chip and the 10th-generation tablet pairs perfectly with the 1st-gen Apple Pencil. Get fit in style with the latest Apple Watch release. Use the workout app to track progress and view advanced health data like ECGs on-demand and temperature readings — all in this small but mighty package. Looking for a lighter, thinner take on the iPad? Look no further than this most recent iPad Air, available now for 20% off. Did you know that Beats are made with the same hardware as AirPods? Now you do! For just under $100, you can score a pair of these popular Beats by Dre earbuds. These Beats are also just $100 today, so if you prefer over-ear headphones, there’s still a way to save big during the Spring Sale. If you’re more about the smart features of the Apple Watch than the fitness ones, consider the SE. You can still track basic health and fitness stats, plus all of the basic functions of the Apple Watch — texting, answering calls, controlling the music in your AirPods, and more. The powerful M1 chip runs this MacBook Pro, which is currently 12% off on A...",1

‘Manhunt’ Costume Designer Katie Irish Took a Bold Approach to Dressing the Victorian Period,2024-03-20T19:39:45+00:00,https://wwd.com/eye/lifestyle/manhunt-costume-designer-katie-irish-apple-tv-1236267741/,"

 The Apple TV+ series starring Tobias Menzies and Anthony Boyle recounts Abraham Lincoln’s assassination and the subsequent 10-day search for his killer, John Wilkes Booth. Deputy Eye Editor 
	At the end of her costume pitch deck for “Manhunt,” costume designer Katie Irish offered a bold proposal. 
	“The thing that occurred to me is that so often when we watch these period pieces, they all seem sepia-toned. That’s not the reality of what it looked like,” says Irish. “Given the advances that had happened in technology, everyone was mad for color. They loved it,” she adds. “And so I put a note on there that was like, I know that this is how this period has typically been presented, but just to make you aware, we can go as bold as you want.” 
	The Apple TV+ series recounts Abraham Lincoln’s assassination and the subsequent 10-day search for his killer, John Wilkes Booth. The story is centered on U.S. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, played by Tobias Menzies, who leads the charge to find Booth. While some of the historical characters depicted on screen have long-standing visual precedent — most viewers are able to conjure an image of Lincoln, for example — others are less immediately distinct.

	“There were two separate camps of people,” says Irish. “There were the people that were iconic. For that, my main challenge was: I need this person to be human, not a symbol,” she adds. “And then there were people who I had never heard of, who were huge players in this story. And so then discovering who they were was also a really interesting task.”

 
	A self-described “research nerd and geek,” Irish rooted her process in history but was willing to tweak details in support of the overall visual story. “We’re not doing a reenactment and we’re not doing an actual historical document of ‘this is exactly how it happened.’ It is historical fiction. And so we do take a couple of licenses.” 
	Irish dressed Booth, whose outfit on the night of Lincoln’s murder was well-documented, in an all-black ensemble with a gray hat and riding boots. “[Booth] spends 90 percent of the show in that one look,” says Irish.  
	Staying true to that overall look, she played with texture within his darker color palette. She also contrasted Booth’s costumes with the lighter palette of his accomplice and frequent scene partner, David Herold, for visual variation. Booth (played by Anthony Boyle) is on the run for much of the series, movement that is marked by degradation in his costumes. 
	“You get all the beautiful costumes from the tailors and then my lead distressor would be like, OK, so this one — we need to have a tear in the pant from where mud cut ...",0

Best Apple TV deals: Save on the Apple TV 4K and more,2024-03-20T18:58:58+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/best-cheap-apple-tv-deals-sales/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? One of the best ways to go about watching the best new movies to stream on Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Max (HBO) and more is with an Apple TV. It’s an external device that can connect to any modern TV with an HDMI connection, and with it comes access to all sorts of streaming services and apps. Apple has several models on the market, with the 4K version being the newest and some older HD versions of the Apple TV still available to purchase. We found some Apple TV deals out there, and have rounded them all up here for some easy savings. Read onward for a little information on which Apple TV model may be best for your home theater, and for a rundown of the best Apple TV deals taking place right now. The latest Apple TV 4K (2022) is potentially overpowered for what it is. Most people will simply want an easy way to stream content but this system also has a reasonable processor that means you can play games on it too. It won’t be an essential feature for everyone but being able to add on a controller and enjoy some gaming without the need for a dedicated console is a neat touch. For AV enthusiasts, there’s HDR10+ support which is useful for Samsung TV owners. The older Apple TV from 2021 lacks HDR10+ support but is still pretty speedy for everything else you might wish to do. If that all sounds good to you, take a look at the best Apple TV deals below. A refurbished Apple TV really isn’t much different from buying new. It’s the same item you want but it’s had a previous owner. Fortunately, from the retailers below, it’s still been put through a rigorous testing process and you get a full one year warranty so there’s not much to lose here. Refurbished Apple TVs tend to be older than the latest model so they can be a little slower but Apple supports its products for a while to come so you won’t have to worry about missing out on updates or app support. There are a lot of different Apple TV models thanks to Apple producing one of the best streaming devices in recent years. While a much older model might not sound very exciting, it can actually be a good idea if you just want a cheap and simple streaming device for a spare room or bedroom. Most of the older models are HD models so if you want to hook it up to a 4K TV, you’ll miss out on the superior resolution. Also, older models tend to be slower so if you want to play games, you may find it struggling. We’re not counting on anyone exclusively playing games on their Apple TV but it’s a nice bonus if you want to entertain the kids without hooking up a full games console. For many people, it makes sense to stick with the 4K models so you’re future proofed even if you don’t currently have a 4K TV. Also, they tend to come with more responsive remotes, while there are also better connections for your other devices such as Thread support on the 128GB 2022 model and an Ethernet connection. It’s worth looking at those fin...",2
Itching to try Vision Pro's Travel Mode? Here's what to expect before you go,2024-03-20T18:51:16+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/itching-to-try-vision-pros-travel-mode-heres-what-to-expect-before-you-go/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular Here's a safety tip: Don't drive a car, fly a plane, pilot a train, sail a ship, ride a skateboard, or otherwise attempt to navigate a vehicle of any kind while wearing an Apple Vision Pro headset over your eyes. Also: Apple Vision Pro FAQ: Price, features, hands-on insights, and everything you need to know It's not just that the field of view is vastly reduced from your factory-installed eyeballs; the device could shut down, lose the connection to its battery or run out of juice, or otherwise blind you while you're careening down the highway filming yourself in a mad quest for a few additional views.  When Apple -- in its seminal 1997 ""Think Different"" ad campaign -- said ""Here's to the crazy ones,"" they were talking about people trying to change the world, not YouTubers trying to outdo the cast of Jackass. (Don't remember that Apple commercial? It's worth revisiting.)   I mention this because -- as we move into our discussion of using the Apple Vision Pro on trains, planes, and automobiles (as well as ships) -- we expect you to be a passenger.  The Apple Vision Pro does have two modes related to travel: Airplane Mode and Travel Mode.  Airplane Mode on the Vision Pro does the same thing it does on your iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch: It turns off all the radios except for Bluetooth. As with your other devices, if the airline allows it, you can turn on Wi-Fi by tapping the button shown in the screenshot below.  Also: Apple Vision Pro review: Fascinating, flawed, and needs to fix 5 things You can access Airplane Mode along with the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi options by looking up and tapping the Control Panel button.  Once the Control Panel opens, glance and touch your fingers together to toggle the airplane icon.  You can also turn on Airplane Mode directly from the Settings panel. Open Settings from the main dashboard and flip the toggle on.  If you're traveling with your Vision Pro device, Travel Mode is where things start to get interesting.  This mode's purpose is to stabilize the visuals in the device by turning off some of the tracking sensors. That way, external movement doesn't -- or at least, shouldn't -- disturb your screen.  First, let's talk about how you access Travel Mode, and how you turn it on and off. Then we'll go into more depth about what it can and can't do for you.  The Travel Mode control lives on the control panel just to the left of the Airplane Mode icon.  Once you turn on Travel Mode, the Vision Pro will present a confirmation dialog:  Apple seems aware that some folks might try to use this while driving, so it specifically cautions, ""It should not be used while operating a moving vehicle.""  While in Travel Mode, the Control Center switcher shows an indicator that you're in Travel Mode. You can turn it off here, or in the full Control Center.  (One quick aside: Apple calls this screen ""Control Center"" and it also calls the screen that looks more like the Control Center iOS users are familiar with ""Control Center."" ...",-2
iPhone 16 buyers may be treated to slimmer bezels and bigger screens,2024-03-20T18:23:34+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-iphone-16-slimmer-bezels-bigger-screens-rumor-news/,"Apple is reportedly planning to further shrink bezels with the upcoming iPhone 16 series. According to Korea’s Sisa Journal, Apple is banking on a new display tech called BRS (Border Reduction Structure) that has allowed suppliers like Samsung, LG, and BOE to reduce the size of the black borders around the screen. Notably, all four iPhone 16 trims will get the display tech upgrade, but its true benefits will be reserved for the pricier Pro models. The report, citing market research firm Omdia, notes that both the Pro models will see their screen size go up by 0.2 inches thanks to slimmer bezels. The iPhone 16 Pro is said to offer a 6.3-inch OLED screen, while the Max version will climb all the way up to 6.9 inches of screen real estate. But it seems the pill-shaped Dynamic Island cutout, which houses the Face ID and True Depth front camera system, is here to stay. Now, a lot has been written about the pros and cons of thinning bezels on phones. Japan’s Sharp kicked off the trend with its Aquos Crystal smartphone, while Xiaomi’s MIX and Vivo’s NEX series phones took the bezel-less aesthetics to an all-screen format. But those sleek panels negatively impacted durability, handling, and speaker output. Over the years, the likes of Corning have worked to improve the durability of display panels, and bezels have made a subtle comeback while the craze of crack-prone curved screens has subsided. In Apple’s case, bezels haven’t always taken priority, even though we’ve come a long way since the iPhone X introduced a fresh look. But achieving thin bezels without sacrificing practical utility isn’t a cakewalk, as one research paper co-sponsored by BOE — one of Apple’s longtime display suppliers — will tell you. A comprehensive research analysis of smartphone durability that was published in the Journal of Cleaner Production notes that “all-glass, bezel-free smartphones could increase the area of the phone that is susceptible to cracks and breakages.” the report also adds that nearly three-quarters of all incidents involving damage to displays are caused by falling on corners or edges. But there’s more to the science behind shrinking bezels on phones, and one of the key elements is directly linked to speakers. With the increase in display sizes on smartphones, the space available for traditional dynamic receivers has diminished. This has led to smaller openings for these speaker units at the top, which has spurred the development of more novel ideas. Traditional dynamic receivers work by the vibration of a diaphragm attached to a moving coil to project sound through an opening at the top of the display, which looks like a slit with a mesh on top. But as smartphones started gravitating toward bezel-less looks, alternative sound generation methods have arrived on the scene. Indirect vibration actuators, for instance, employ a coil within a casing to vibrate the entire case, including the display panel, to produce sound. This method allows the display itself to ...",2
"‘Palm Royale’ features Carol Burnett, Kristen Wiig, Allison Janney and new-to-comedy Ricky Martin",2024-03-20T18:22:38+00:00,https://www.mymotherlode.com/entertainment/3326980/palm-royale-features-carol-burnett-kristen-wiig-allison-janney-and-new-to-comedy-ricky-martin.html,"

                                                 ‘Palm Royale’ features Carol Burnett, Kristen Wiig, Allison Janney and new-to-comedy Ricky Martin                                                  How do you get comedy legend Carol Burnett to sign on to your TV show when her character spends multiple episodes in a coma? That was a task for Abe Sylvia, creator, showrunner and executive producer of the new Apple TV+ series “Palm Royale,” streaming now, about a woman’s efforts to enter high society. Burnett “was curious as to where it goes,” revealed Sylvia, who assured her that she would have more to do. Fortunately, Sylvia already had a great cast lined up — Kristen Wiig, Laura Dern (also an executive producer), Allison Janney and Leslie Bibb — which impressed Burnett. “She said, ‘Those are the best ladies in the business. I want to be on set with them. I want to have dinner with them. I’m game.’” Once he got a yes from Burnett, Sylvia stuck to his word that the role would be worth Burnett’s time. “I went back to the writers room. I said, ‘We now have Carol Burnett playing this role. We need to make sure it is worthy of Carol Burnett.’” They added more scenes for her character — with dialogue. In hindsight, Burnett, who turns 91 in April, jokes those coma scenes weren’t so bad. “I did fall asleep, so it was perfect, although I’d been up since 5 a.m. to get ready to come there and then go back to bed,” Burnett said. “Palm Royale” is based on the novel “Mr. & Mrs. American Pie” by Juliet McDaniel. The series is set in 1969 and follows Wiig as Maxine Simmons, a woman who will do anything to be accepted into Palm Beach high society. For her, the pinnacle is becoming a member of an exclusive club called Palm Royale. In her first scene, Maxine scales a large fence around the property to sit by the pool and order a cocktail. “She’s complicated,” said Wiig. “You still want to root for her even though it’s like, what is she doing? You want her to get there and you want her to succeed, and she keeps getting in her own way.” Maxine’s “in” to both Palm Royale and its members is Burnett’s character, Norma D’ellacourt, who she is related to by marriage. With Norma in a coma, Maxine believes her husband will inherit her fortune. It’s established that Norma is the societal queen bee who seems to know everyone’s secrets and the concern for her health is more surface than sincere. Most would rather she stay in a coma, which Burnett says is understandable. “You get to know who she is and she’s not a very nice person,” said Burnett, “Those are really a lot of fun to play.” “Palm Royale” also gave Burnett the opportunity to improvise with Wiig, who shares a sketch comedy background. Wiig is a “Saturday Night Live” alum. “We would do the script, and then the director would say, ‘OK, do it for yourselves now’ so that we could play. That’s a great gift to...",1
Parler's New Owners Swear This Time Will Be Different,2024-03-20T18:10:46+00:00,https://www.wired.com/story/parler-app-store-free-speech-censorship/,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. Makena Kelly William Turton After nearly a year offline, Parler, the “censorship free” social media network, is under new ownership and staging a comeback ahead of the 2024 presidential election. And this time, the new owners tell WIRED that the site will no longer host the violent, controversial content previously associated with Parler. For months, Parler has teased its return, promising a sleeker design and a short-form video feed called “bursts” that looks a lot like TikTok. After being offline since April 2023, the Parler app returned to the Apple App Store on Monday. The site is currently invite-only, with registration codes reportedly set to go out this week to anyone who signs up in the app or on Parler’s website. On X, Parler said that it expects the app to be approved for Android later this week. Parler was originally removed from Apple’s and Google’s app stores after the deadly January 6 riot at the Capitol, due to the site’s inability or unwillingness to remove posts encouraging violence and crime. ProPublica published more than 500 videos posted on Parler showing the rioters approaching and entering the Capitol. Later, Amazon stopped hosting Parler on its Amazon Web Services cloud. Before the site was taken offline, a researcher scraped all of Parler’s public posts, which included location data. The posts showed that Parler’s users had posted from inside the Capitol during the riot. Apple and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Parler’s return to their app stores. In December, NBC News reported that Parler had been sold to Ryan Rhodes and Elise Pierotti, a brother and sister duo, along with Jaco Booyens, a self-described anti-sex-trafficking activist. Rhodes, a former Republican operative, is the company’s CEO. Rhodes told WIRED he previously advised other tech companies but declined to name them, citing a nondisclosure agreement. Elise Pierotti is returning as chief marketing officer, a role she previously held at the company. Booyens is now an adviser, Rhodes told WIRED on Tuesday. “The original idea behind Parler that people gravitated to as a free-speech platform brought successes,” Rhodes says. “There was a lot of things that did not allow it to be what it could have been. Our goal is to make Parler what it could have been, as a true open platform for everybody to have discourse, right or left.” The Rhodes–Pierotti vision for Parler isn’t too dissimilar from that of John Matze, the site’s founder. Matze launched Parler in 2018 as a free-speech alternative to mainstream social media platforms like Twitter (now X) and Facebook. The app gained a cultlike following from conservatives and the far right at a time when former president Donald Trump and his administration were going after the big Silicon Valley tech platforms Facebook and Instagram for allegedly censoring conservative speech online. In February, Matze launched a new platform...",0
Senior Wins $4M in Misguided SWAT Raid Case,2024-03-20T18:08:00+00:00,https://www.newsreports.com/senior-wins-4m-in-misguided-swat-raid-case/,"Ruby Johnson, a senior citizen from Denver, has claimed a record-breaking $4 million settlement following a botched SWAT raid on her home. The raid was based on inaccurate information obtained from the Find My iPhone application by Apple. While this is the highest settlement of its kind in Denver’s history, witnesses suggest that Johnson is far from pleased, hinting at the emotional trauma such an event can cause. She is reportedly planning to use a portion of the settlement to establish a community initiative for improving police-resident relations. The incident has sparked discussions about the trustworthiness of mobile applications and the procedures followed by law enforcement agencies while relying on them. Reportedly, the raid was conducted without proper research to verify the accuracy of the data, which had led to the violation of Johnson’s constitutional rights. The Florida judge supported Johnson’s claim, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive pre-raid investigations to preserve individual liberties. The details from the incident highlight an armored vehicle, armed officers, and a police dog present on Johnson’s lawn. Despite Johnson’s assertion about the absence of any weapons in her home, the police carried out their intrusive search, failing to adhere to the basic legal principles. The raid followed a report about a stolen truck and firearms traced to Johnson’s home due to the app’s tracking data. The police found the stolen truck in the garage, but the search throughout the property revealed even more stolen firearms. However, Detective Gary Staab, responsible for obtaining the search warrant, faced criticism for not informing the court about the limitations of the Find My iPhone app, hence misleading the court granting the warrant. This has raised questions regarding the legality and validity of the search warrant. Despite her cooperation, Johnson had to endure hours in the back of a police car and significant damage to her property. The unnecessary raid was viewed by neighbors, feeding speculation among the community and leaving Johnson’s house in disarray on the basis of unfounded accusations. ©2024 Copyright Newsreports - All Rights Reserved.",-2
"Apple isn’t living up to the letter or spirit of court order in Epic suit, Meta and Microsoft say",2024-03-20T18:02:22+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106838/apple-epic-anti-steering-developers-in-app-payments-meta-microsoft-match,"By  Lauren Feiner, the senior policy reporter at The Verge, covering the intersection of Silicon Valley and Capitol Hill. She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform. Apple is not living up to the letter or spirit of an order issued by a California federal judge in its trial against Epic Games. That’s what Meta, Microsoft, Match Group, and X told the court in an amicus brief on Wednesday. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers told Apple in 2021 that it could not prevent app developers from using “buttons, external links, or other calls to action” informing users of payment options outside of their apps. Epic and other developers have taken issue with Apple’s 15 to 30 percent fees on in-app purchases, which Apple makes difficult to avoid by also preventing them from directing users to payment options at a lower price outside of the iOS ecosystem. Apple has defended the fees as reasonable compensation for its own services on the App Store. But the companies that filed the brief Wednesday, all of which say they’ve been subject to Apple’s rules against steering users away from its own payment processing, say Apple’s idea of compliance would not fix the problem. Its proposal to let developers point to an external purchase link is complex and burdensome, the companies say.  “Apple’s new restrictions are plainly designed to render alternatives to Apple’s IAP impractical for developers, and inaccessible and unappealing to consumers, thus circumventing both the spirit and underlying goals of the injunction,” the companies wrote in their brief.  Epic itself has asked the judge to enforce her original order, saying that Apple is in “blatant violation” of the injunction. But it’s notable that other large developers, like Meta and Microsoft, have decided to weigh in now and shows that Apple’s rules can impact even the largest of tech companies. The amici say that Apple’s 12 to 27 percent fee on external purchases defeats the purpose of the new requirement since it’s only a few percentage points below what developers would otherwise be required to pay for in-app purchases. The external purchase fee could make it unrealistic for developers to even set up an external payments system, given that other transaction costs they might incur through that route could eliminate any of the 3 percent gains they’d get from moving away from Apple’s system. Plus, customers are unlikely to choose the external option if it’s the same price or higher. The companies explain how Apple’s in-app payment requirements impact them and allegedly harm them and their users. Meta, for example, says that Apple decided in 2022 to require Meta to pay the IAP fee for its product that lets advertisers boost posts within their apps to reach more users. Meta says this change increases the costs of using the feature, which would not be the case if Meta could steer users to its own payment options. When asked for comment on the amicus brief...",-3

Apple's second-generation AirPods turn five years old this week, and I'm proud to say that I've been using the same exact pair that I bought back in 2019. In tech terms, five years is an eternity.  Now, I know what you're thinking. If your first concern after reading this is disgust (or a strange curiosity) I don't blame you. There are a host of viral stories across the internet about people sprouting fungus in their ears (known as otomycosis), or getting ear infections from wearing earbuds ""constantly"", that make the prospect of using the same pair for an extended amount of time seem like a bad idea.  Also: Two new AirPods models expected this fall - here's everything we know so far To which I say: don't be gross. Clean your tech. Whether we're talking about your phone, wearable devices, or AirPods, part of taking care of them is keeping them clean, which also goes a long way to their longevity and operation. I've kept mine clean and never once had any run-ins with fungus, microbes, or otherwise.    Notwithstanding submersion in mystery liquids, being crushed, stepped on, or dropped down sewer grates, these things are actually quite durable. The design of the AirPods is such that there are very few mechanical elements to ""break down"" solely by wear and tear. In fact, many of the most commonly faced problems with the AirPods are related to ""debris"" getting stuck in sensitive ports, affecting charging or connections, all of which can be mitigated with regular tech hygiene.  Another tip for maximizing your AirPods longevity is keeping track of the actual earbuds...",1

Why Apple is throwing millions at Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman to make TV nobody watches,2024-03-20T16:51:11+00:00,https://ca.style.yahoo.com/why-apple-throwing-millions-meryl-165111650.html,"Everything is under $300 — shoppers are loving these budget-friendly picks. Apple TV+ has a busy March. Ridley Scott’s Napoleon launches on the service starring Joaquin Phoenix as the great man. There’s Kristen Wiig’s new comedy Palm Royale, about Palm Beach society in the late 1960s. And there’s Manhunt, a show that could only appear on Apple TV+, with Tobias Menzies playing Edwin Stanton, Abraham Lincoln’s secretary of war, trying to hunt down the ex-president’s killer John Wilkes Booth. It follows February’s drop of the heavily Oscar-nominated but zero Oscar-winning Martin Scorsese film Killers of the Flower Moon – a movie that grossed $137 million against a budget of $200 million. For most studios, this would be a deep breath moment. But at the start of February, Apple’s first quarter results saw the company post revenue of $119.6 billion, up 2 percent year over year. It has $162 billion in the bank. It’s currently valued at $2.7 trillion. It can absorb the pain. The question Hollywood keeps asking is – why would it? It’s making so much money through its other business, the TV operation seems an unusual diversification. Apple is now in a peculiar place. On the one hand, Apple TV+ excels at what GQ recently called Prestige Dad TV. It’s home to projects from Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Martin Scorsese, Michael Douglas, Gary Oldman, Idris Elba, Ridley Scott, Matthew Vaughn, Samuel L Jackson, Brad Pitt and George Clooney. Stars and creatives are lining up to work with them, just as they did with HBO in the 2010s. It’s a safe, non-interfering and highly lucrative home for their latest passion projects. The company is spending $1 billion annually on movies destined for cinemas and $6.5 billion on TV programming. The budget for season one of the cerebral sci-fi series Foundation was $45 million – which is around the same as the most expensive BBC TV show to date, His Dark Materials, but small fry compared with The Morning Show’s $15 million per episode. Apple has also been buying up projects others can no longer afford. Masters of the Air was in development at HBO from 2013 but in 2019 Apple acquired it when HBO balked at the $250 million price tag. Coming up this year, we have: Michael Douglas starring in Franklin, a deluxe period drama about Benjamin Franklin trying to persuade France to recognise the newly independent USA; Cate Blanchett, Kevin Kline and Sacha Baron Cohen in a thriller written and directed by Gravity’s Alfonso Cuarón; Sugar, a “genre-bending” private eye mystery starring Colin Farrell; and Presumed Innocent, a legal drama starring Jake Gyllenhaal. To name just a few. On the other hand, not that many people are watching. Whilst Apple hasn’t released official subscriber numbers since 2019, estimates for its UK base hover around two million, compared to Netflix’s 16.3 million, and in the US, it has 15-20 million compared to Netflix’s 80 million. Only Ted Lasso and Idris Elba’s Hijack consistently made it into the US Nielsen streame...",2

Here's what you need to know about Apple TV+'s stylish new series ""Palm Royale is a true underdog story that follows Maxine Simmons (Kristen Wiig) as she endeavors to break into Palm Beach high society,"" teases Apple TV+.  ""As Maxine attempts to cross that impermeable line between the haves and the have-nots, Palm Royale asks the same question that still baffles us today: 'How much of yourself are you willing to sacrifice to get what someone else has?'

‘Shark Tank’ star Kevin O’Leary rips Trump’s $454M civil fraud penalty as ‘an attack on America’,2024-03-20T15:13:15+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/20/us-news/shark-tank-star-kevin-oleary-rips-trumps-454m-civil-fraud-penalty-as-an-attack-on-america/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary has blasted the $454 million bond former President Donald Trump has been ordered to cough up in his New York civil fraud case, arguing the “extraordinary” penalty is “an attack on America.” The investor railed against the penalty after Trump’s attorneys revealed in court papers earlier this week that the ex-president hasn’t been able to secure the massive bond — raising the chances that New York Attorney General Letitia James will move to seize some of his prized Big Apple properties.  “This is the United States of America under siege,” O’Leary said during a Tuesday appearance on Fox News’ “Outnumbered”. O’Leary, who heads the O’Leary Ventures firm, went on to argue that seizing assets on a bond was unprecedented and “very troubling” for the American economic brand.      “This is an attack on America and I don’t know how you can look at it any other way,” he said.  “And as an investor, and I know plenty of investors who are completely disturbed by this … but no one is going to put any money to work in New York in these amounts until this thing settles down.” Trump, 77, has been given until March 25 to post the whopping sum under the bombshell ruling issued last month by Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron.  The AG, who successfully argued at trial that Trump exaggerated his net worth by billions a year on financial statements to get better loan and insurance terms, has previously indicated she’ll go after his landmark properties if he doesn’t pay up.  “I think New Yorkers should think well past Trump, whether he’s president or not, or whether this attorney general has gone in four years or not, it’s irrelevant,” O’Leary said.  “This is case-setting against the American brand. The most stable country on Earth, anywhere, to put capital to work over a long period of time, particularly in real estate, is the United States of America.” “This is an assault on what we believe to be core and I find it extraordinary. I think it’s very troubling. It has absolutely nothing to do with Donald Trump at this point, in my view. And it is completely bipartisan,” he added.  It comes after Trump went off on Judge Engoron in a series of Truth Social posts on Tuesday, calling the jurist a “corrupt puppet” in thrall to the attorney general and declaring that the sum is “practically impossible” to pay. “Engoron laughed with disdain at the Appellate Division, his superior court, when they handed down a decision which essentially ended most of the case, and he REFUSED TO ABIDE BY IT. This is the first time something like that has ever happened in New York State,” Trump raged in the post.  “He is a Crazed, Trump Hating, Rogue Judge, has ZERO respect for the Appellate Judges, and has torn apart the Legal System in New York State, making it impossible for outside businesses to want to come there. Existing businesses will flee!!! Trump’s legal team filed papers Monday see...",0

Beeper couldn’t bring iMessage to Android — but it can still make a great chat app,2024-03-20T15:00:00+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106219/beeper-beta-android-app-chat-messaging,"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Beeper needed a fresh start. Late last year, the company bet big on a hacked-together iMessage app for Android, only to be shut down by Apple within days. Beeper tried to fight back, but it ultimately threw in the towel just weeks later in a widely covered defeat. “December was a wild ride,” Eric Migicovsky, the co-founder of Beeper, tells The Verge.  With dreams of an iMessage app dead, Beeper went back to square one to figure out its next steps. And the answer was to stop fighting Apple and return to its original goal: bringing every chat app — iMessage excepted — into a single place. “We’ve refocused on our primary mission,” Migicovsky says, “which is to build the best chat app on earth.” The new Beeper app launched in beta last week, and it’s a complete rewrite of the app the Beeper team was originally working on. It doesn’t turn your green Android bubbles to blue — like Beeper Mini briefly did — but it does a whole lot of other cool things that make messaging the friends you have across different platforms a lot easier. I’ve never been more aware of all the people I’ve been ghosting It starts with your text messages. Beeper’s inbox can pull in the RCS and SMS messages your phone is already receiving. You can then connect Beeper to messaging services like Telegram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Signal and to social platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, and X. Even full-on chat services like Discord and Slack are supported. The app also syncs to a desktop client, so you can access your messages across platforms. I’ve been trying out a beta version of the app for the past week, and I’ve never been more aware of all the people I’ve been ghosting. That’s because all your linked messages get siphoned into a single inbox — read, unread, or ignored. It was a little eye-opening for me, as I sifted through messages I completely missed or forgot about on platforms I don’t use as often, like LinkedIn and Discord. There’s a real convenience to it, as you don’t have to keep checking individual apps. On Instagram, for example, I don’t turn my notifications on because I don’t care about getting pings about liked photos — but that means I don’t notifications about DMs. I also don’t have the LinkedIn app, so I don’t get push notifications about messages there, either. Beeper basically solves that problem for me. But it does get a little chaotic at times. There are some ways to organize all of your messages, but it’s not quite enough yet. You can’t delete or archive chats, for instance. Beeper says it’s working on adding this in the future. For now, you can choose from either a “Minimal” or “Pro” interface. The Pro version lets you toggle on app icons for each chat, indicating the services each message comes from, while the Minimal version doesn’t, keeping things a bit tidier. I’ve found it helpful to pin cer...",0

As we get closer to the full launch of the Samsung Galaxy Ring, we’re slowly learning more about its many talents – and some fresh rumors suggest these could include planning meals to improve your diet. According to the Korean site Chosun Biz (via GSMArena), Samsung plans to integrate the Galaxy Ring with its new Samsung Food app, launched in August 2023.  Samsung calls this app an “AI-powered food and recipe platform”, as it can whip up tailored meal plans and even give you step-by-step guides to making specific dishes.

In a report signed by Renault Group CEO Luca de Meo, the auto industry was described as a “pillar of the European economy” that was “facing an onslaught of electric vehicles from China.” It comes after numerous auto firms — both within and outside of Europe — said that competition from China was among their biggest challenges.

A “secret” composer who has released music under hundreds of different names has been identified as Sweden’s most-listened-to artist on Spotify – pulling in more plays than Britney Spears or Abba. Johan Röhr, a Stockholm-based musician, has been unmasked as the person behind more than 650 different artists on the streaming service who have been played 15bn times, making him Sweden’s current most-played artist. The Guardian  AI doomster Elon Musk appears to have changed his tune on the technology, claiming the pros of advancing the tech ultimately outweigh the cons. Musk was speaking publicly for the first time at an artificial intelligence summit Tuesday, a little less than a week after the billionaire fired Don Lemon.

Apple CEO Arrives In China Touting Its Role As iPhone Base,2024-03-20T12:31:34+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/tim-cook-shows-up-in-shanghai-ahead-of-new-apple-store-opening,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook arrived in China on Wednesday touting the country’s importance as a market and production base, reaching out to Chinese consumers who may be souring on the maker of iPhones. There’s no supply chain in the world more critical to the company than China’s, Cook told the Global Times in an interview tweeted by the newspaper. Apple’s been expanding its base in the country and increasing investment over the past 30 years, he added. Cook’s comments, ahead of Thursday’s launch of Apple’s eighth store in Shanghai, come as the “symbiotic” relationship between the company and China as he once described is showing signs of fraying.  Anchored by Foxconn, or Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Apple’s manufacturing presence in China has been broad and unshakable for over two decades. But the company has suffered snags in production in recent years due to a US and China trade war and Covid-triggered factory closures, delaying launches of products.  Apple is now diversifying its operations away from China by working with assembly and component manufacturing partners in India, Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere. Apple’s 10 Biggest Challenges, From AI to China: QuickTake Read More: Apple’s iPhone Woes in China Deepen With a 24% Sales Plunge Demand for its products in China is also cooling. Phone sales plunged 24% over the first six weeks of this year, according to research firm Counterpoint. Apple has been losing market share to US-sanctioned Huawei Technologies Co., which has benefited from a wave of patriotic buying for its homegrown Mate 60 Pro devices. The upcoming Shanghai store adds to Apple’s biggest retail network outside the US and is part of a broader effort to grow and revitalize the company’s brick-and-mortar outlets. China remains a vital market for the company with the world’s largest smartphone consumer base and potential for growing sales of accessories like the Apple Watch. Apple’s apparent vote of confidence for China is no less important to Xi Jinping’s government. With the economy slowing, new foreign direct investment falling and multinationals looking to other markets for growth, it’s important to show the world China is still open for business in the wake of regulatory crackdowns and national security concerns that have spooked foreign investors. Cook posted a video of himself on walking around Shanghai with Chinese actor Zheng Kai. In a Weibo clip seen by half a million people within minutes of posting, Cook crossed a bridge near the historic Bund, sampled soup dumplings in a local restaurant and said “hello” in the Shanghainese dialect. Born and raised in Shanghai, Zheng is one of China’s most famous TV and movie stars. He recently starred in , a TV show aired on Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s video streaming service.

Julian Edelman has a problem with what Wes Welker said in ‘Dynasty’,2024-03-28T23:40:16+00:00,https://awfulannouncing.com/nfl/patriots-dynasty-julian-edelman-wes-welker.html,"Awful Announcing Several former New England Patriots have come out in droves lately to criticize the popular Dynasty docuseries produced by Apple TV+. Recently, Robert Kraft, Rodney Harrison, Devin McCourty, Matthew Slater, and Julian Edelman have voiced their displeasure over certain portrayals and aspects of the documentary series on the Patriots’ near-20-year run at the top of the NFL. Edelman and Slater debated their issues with the documentary on Edelman’s Games With Names podcast. Edelman also revealed he had another problem with the docuseries on that show, specifically about former wide receiver Wes Welker. Welker and Edelman have a bit of a connection to each other through the Patriots dynasty years. The Pats famously got Welker, a former Miami Dolphin, to become Tom Brady’s slot receiver in the mid-2000s. What happened next was something few expected. Welker went on to not only become the best slot receiver in the NFL, but he also arguably helped change the game for slot receivers to give them even more prominence. Edelman essentially “replaced” Welker after he went to the Denver Broncos. Edelman didn’t mince words talking about Welker and his portrayal of head coach Bill Belichick. After coming to Belichick’s defense over his portrayal in the entire documentary, the former Kent State star spoke his mind about Welker’s role in the film. Via the New York Post, Edelman said, “Welker’s out here saying like Aaron Hernandez got away with murder — figuratively speaking — at practice; that’s not even true. Welker painted the picture that he [Hernandez] was like the king, like he got to do anything.” Edelman continued. “I remember Bill motherf—ing Aaron all the time. Come on, Welk. Trying to make up stories. We know you don’t like Bill,” he said. After Slater batted the conversation down, Edelman added, “I love him too, but it’s clear he hates Bill.” The griping over this docuseries only appears to be heightening, not slowing down.

How to turn off the Apple Vision Pro when you’re done using it,2024-03-28T23:25:11+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-turn-off-apple-vision-pro/,"The Vision Pro is an amazingly complex piece of hardware, an ultra-premium head-mounted display that's as powerful as a MacBook. As wonderful as it might be to use one of the best VR headsets in the world, there comes a time to turn off the Apple Vision Pro, and that can be the cause of some concern. Apple Vision Pro While there are many ways the Vision Pro is different than other iOS products, one of the most obvious is that it doesn't have an off or a sleep button. Fortunately, turning off your Vision Pro is remarkably easy, once you know where to look, but it's important to turn it off properly to prevent problems. There are five ways to turn off your Vision Pro headset, the easiest being with Siri. Just say, ""Siri, turn off my Apple Vision Pro"" and the screen should go dark soon after. Each ""step"" below is another way to power off your Vision Pro. Step 1: The Vision Pro has a great deal in common with other Apple devices. It has a Digital Crown like an Apple Watch. A tap shows your app library, but if you press and hold to, you'll see a slider that you can drag to power off your headset. Step 2: You can use the Settings app to switch off your headset. Tap the Digital Crown to bring up your apps, then open Settings. In the General tab, select Shut Down. A slider will appear and moving it to the right will turn off your Vision Pro. Step 3: If you take the right steps, it's OK to switch off your headset by detaching the power cord. First, take off your Vision Pro and set it down on a desk or table. The headset detects that you are no longer wearing it and goes into sleep mode. It's OKto unplug it once it's asleep. Twist the power cable counterclockwise and it should come loose from the Vision Pro without using any force. Step 4: The fifth way to turn your headset off is to leave it in sleep mode. Apple points out that after 24 hours of inactivity, your Vision Pro will automatically power down to save battery life. Before using it the next time, you'll need to switch it back on. After you've powered off, you'll need to switch your Vision Pro on again to use it. There are two ways to turn on the headset. If you unplugged the battery to switch the Vision Pro off, reconnect it. You can also swap batteries if you own a second Vision Pro Battery. The headset should automatically light up when it gets power again. If you used any of the other methods of shutting down your Vision Pro, simply press and hold the top button for a few seconds. You'll see the Apple logo on the front display when it's powered on. You'll rarely need to turn off your Vision Pro if you keep the battery charged throughout the day. When you take a break, just remove the headset and set it down to enable battery-saving sleep mode. If the Vision Pro stays in sleep for more than 24 hours, it will power itself down automatically. Battery life is an issue for all standalone VR headsets, but some already have solutions. Unlike Apple's Vision Pro, Meta's Quest Pro includes a convenient c...",1

Claim filed in shooting death of autistic teen by San Bernardino County deputies,2024-03-28T23:12:19+00:00,https://www.sbsun.com/2024/03/28/claim-filed-in-shooting-death-of-autistic-teen-by-san-bernardino-county-deputies/,"E-Edition Get the latest news delivered daily!  Get the latest news delivered daily! E-Edition 
			Trending:		 The attorney for the family of the autistic 15-year-old boy who was shot to death by a San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputy as he wielded a garden hoe said Thursday, March 28, that deputies failed to fulfill their role as part of the safety net for those suffering from mental health issues. Deputies responded to the Iroquois Road home of Ryan Gainer on March 9 after a 911 caller pleaded for deputies to “take him in” and said he had assaulted family members and damaged the house. Recordings from deputies’ body-worn cameras show them walking up to the house. As one deputy calls out “Where is he?” Gainer appears in the door and rushes toward them, carrying the hoe above his head. A deputy, as he retreats, warns Ryan that he will be shot unless he drops the hoe. A second deputy, identified by the department as Wyatt Eisenbrey, fires at Ryan as he chases the deputy in the front yard and appears to be only feet away, the recordings show. At a March 13 news conference, Sheriff Shannon Dicus said deputies had visited the home five times previously and each resulted in Ryan being taken to a mental-health facility with no use of force. “Our social safety network is not working and needs to be strengthened,” Dicus said. “There is no reason for law enforcement to be the ones that end up having to get involved in these crises, specifically when we’ve off-ramped these individuals to social services that are supposed to be designed to take care of their mental-health needs.” But attorney DeWitt M. Lacy, whose law firm filed a wrongful-death claim against the county on March 18 seeking more than $25,000 in damages, said Dicus was “passing the buck.” “They abandoned their training,” Lacy said in an interview. “They shouted, ‘Where is he?’ As soon as they saw Ryan they presented a gun. Law enforcement officers are trained to deal with this. And they are passing the buck right now because it looks bad. Approaching in a calm manner, not making threats; those are the types of things they are actually trained on. “(Dicus is) shucking responsibility and accountability. He can say whatever he wants about some failing in the mental health safety network. The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department is not living up to its job because they are not part of that safety net,” Lacy continued. The claim is a legally required precursor to a lawsuit against the government. County spokesman David Wert declined to comment on the claim, citing the pending litigation, other than to say administrators have not yet reviewed it. Such claims are almost always rejected.

Apple dismisses Microsoft monopoly comparisons,2024-03-28T22:50:58+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/28/apple-dismisses-microsoft-monopoly-comparisons/,"A week after finding itself at the business end of a landmark lawsuit from the United States Department of Justice, Apple is staunchly denying any parallels between itself and Microsoft in the 1990s. It’s a comparison into which the U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland leaned heavily in last week’s filing. While portions of the United States v. Microsoft Corp. were partially overturned, the Windows maker was ultimately required to modify certain business practices deemed monopolistic by the government. Garland and the 16 state attorneys general that participated in the Apple suit are no doubt seeking a similar outcome to curtail practices it believes amount to an unfair advantage for the $2.65 trillion company. “In 1998, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs criticized Microsoft’s monopoly and ‘dirty tactics’ in operating systems to target Apple, which prompted the company ‘to go to the Department of Justice’ in hopes of getting Microsoft ‘to play fair,’” the suit notes, heavily implying hypocrisy on Apple’s part. “But even at that time, Apple did not face the same types of restrictions it imposes on third parties today; Apple users could use their iPod with a Windows computer, and Microsoft did not charge Apple a 30% fee for each song downloaded from Apple’s iTunes store. Similarly, when Apple brought the iPhone to market in 2007, it benefited from competition among component makers and wireless carriers.” For its part, Apple cites global iPhone numbers that are nowhere approaching the 90+% market share Windows enjoyed prior to the turn of the millennium. Lawsuits like this are a rare opportunity to see a large corporation bragging about how few devices they’ve sold relative to the broader market. Indeed, with numbers hovering around 20% globally, it’s difficult to make the case that the company is dominating the competition the way Microsoft did a quarter-century ago. It’s true that the iPhone performs especially well in the domestic market, where it faces less direct competition from many of the low-cost handsets that dominate India and China (the number one and two markets, respectively). Apple suggests, however, that the DOJ’s claim that its “share of the entire U.S. smartphone market exceeds 65%” is misleading, as it refers to revenue rather than units sold. Of the latter, the company believes it commands less than half of its home market. The distinction between these figures comes down to the price per unit. It’s here the DOJ suggests that Apple commands 70% of the “performance” smartphone market. Certainly, it’s true that Apple’s devices largely fall into the premium category, of which the company controls a large swath here in the states. The DOJ will likely have a difficult time proving that this — in and of itself — constitutes a monopoly. This is why much of the 88-page complaint focuses on aspects like Apple’s tight App Store control, the Watch’s inability to interface with Android devices and — of course — the dreaded green bubbles.

Could it be that the information revolution – big tech, big data, the internet and social media – is changing how the economy works in ways we’ve yet to understand and won’t like? The world abounds with economists repeating their conventional wisdom about how the economy works and will keep on working. But one economist politician thinks that digitisation is changing the economy in ways that could lead us back to a new kind of feudalism.

In the Middle Ages, feudalism was a system of reciprocal military and economic obligations running from the king to his land-owning lords, whose vassals managed their land worked by serfs. In Varoufakis’s dystopian vision, the digital revolution, led by a few big technology companies – Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google), Apple, Amazon and Microsoft – is turning capitalism into “technofeudalism”. Hence the title of his book, Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism. In the internet’s initial phase, it was characterised by open protocols and decentralised networking, focused on information sharing and communication.

But “cloud fiefs” are Varoufakis’s term for the digital domains and platforms controlled by the cloudalists. These can be specific services, apps or platforms where the cloudalists have significant control, allowing them to extract “cloud rent”. This process is similar to the way feudal lords controlled land and extracted ordinary rent from those using it.

When Will Apple Release the iPhone 16?,2024-03-28T21:11:11+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/when-will-apple-release-the-iphone-16/,"Published on By We’re a long way away from Apple’s iPhone 16 announcement, but if you’re waiting for the 2024 iPhones, here’s what you can expect from the release date. Apple’s iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max will be replaced by new iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models later this year. The 2024 iPhones reportedly have several upgrades on board including a new button, several camera improvements, and new processors. There are some great reasons to wait for the iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro though you’ll have to wait months for the devices to hit shelves. If you’re determined to wait, or if you’re simply debating it, you’re probably curious about the release date. Those in tune with Apple’s annual iPhone launch probably have a good idea already, but if you’re new to this, or you simply need a reminder, you’re in the right place.  Nothing is confirmed, but you can expect the iPhone 16 release date to land in the fall. Apple typically uses the month of September to launch its flagship iPhone models. Digging a little deeper, we can help you set expectations regarding the iPhone 16’s release date, release time, and the pre-order date. Here’s when Apple announced its last three flagship iPhone models: Looking ahead at the calendar, and given Apple’s history, the most likely dates for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro announcement date are as follows. iPhone 16 Announcement Date Apple typically puts new iPhones up for pre-order at 5AM Pacific on the Friday following the announcement which means September 13th and September 20th are logical dates for the start of iPhone 16 pre-orders. The company’s iPhone pre-order period always extends for a week. So if those dates hold up, the iPhone 16 release date would land on one of two dates. iPhone 16 Release Date We realize nothing is set in stone, and Apple could stray from its release protocol, but this is simply an effort to set proper expectations for prospective iPhone 16 buyers. If you’re considering a move to a flagship iPhone in 2024, keep these dates in mind as we cruise though the year. According to display analyst Ross Young, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will have larger displays. If true, they will be the largest ever for an iPhone. Young believes the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max will come with 6.27-inch and 6.86-inch display sizes, respectively. The iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max have 6.12-inch and 6.69-inch displays. Young says these changes will be exclusive to the Pro models and the lower-end iPhone 16 models are expected to keep the same screen sizes (6.1-inches and 6.7-inches). A well-known leaker on Twitter backs up Young's claims. So does MacRumors. So does yeux1122. Young also believes Apple will also change the aspect ratio on the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max which will make the devices a bit taller than their predecessors. You can get a sense for these potential changes via these CAD images of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max fro...",2
Apple’s new iPad Pro and iPad Air just got delayed,2024-03-28T21:00:36+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/apple-ipad-air-pro-delay-may-2024-release-date-news/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? It seems like the countdown to the next iPad reveal has been stretched out a bit more, though not by an earth-shattering amount of time. So far, we’ve heard rumors of a late March or early April reveal, but that likely won’t happen, according to a new report from Apple insider Mark Gurman. In his latest Bloomberg report, Gurman says the next Apple tablets should arrive in early May, and he cited the speeding up of production at Apple’s suppliers. Interestingly, production-related challenges apparently pushed back the launch of the new slates across the Pro and Air lineups. “Apple had planned to release the new iPads by the end of March or early April, but the company has been working to finish software for the devices,” says the report. “The screens in the latest models also require complex new manufacturing techniques, which have contributed to the delay.” All four iPad trims will rely on the new M3 silicon, which already powers a handful of Mac machines. The biggest change, however, is reserved for the iPad Air, which has only been sold in a single size. This year, Apple is reportedly planning a 12.9-inch version of the tablet. On the premium side of things, the iPad Pro models will be getting an OLED display upgrade, but it’s unclear if the treatment will only be reserved for the large-screen variant or if it will make way to the 11-inch model, as well. Apple has armed the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a mini-LED screen, while the smaller sibling is still locked to an LCD panel. We are not sure if a design revision is also in the pipeline, but new keyboard accessories that make the keyboard + iPad combo look more like a Mac are said to be on the table. But what I am most excited about is the software and how the new M3 silicon handles AI, which Apple is exploring quite seriously. It is even said to be pondering a Gemini Nano licensing deal with Google. Apple has already confirmed that the M3 silicon is capable of running a few language models and tasks like Stable Diffusion-driven image creation locally. The M3 silicon comes with extra AI-related bells and whistles. I recently got my hands on the M3 MacBook Air and saw a notable jump in AI performance. I ran a Python script applying a machine learning method known as Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) regression to estimate red wine quality from specific characteristics provided as training data. This involved training and testing the model, with configuration managed through the “tanh” activation function and the “sgd” (Stochastic Gradient Descent) solver. The goal was to forecast wine quality, with performance measured by execution speed. Here, the M3 chip was 20% faster than the M2. I also explored native image segmentation and generation, utilizing the K-means clustering algorithm within an unsupervised learning framework. This phase entailed inputting an image to segment it into clusters based on pixel color di...",2
"First foldable iPhone might not come until 2027, report claims",2024-03-28T21:00:22+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97186/first-foldable-iphone-might-not-come-until-2027-report-claims/index.html,"The world of smartphones might be full of foldable phones from most of the biggest names in the game, but Apple has so far refused to join in. To date, no foldable iPhone has launched and rumors about such a device's development are all over the place. While it's thought that Apple is indeed developing a foldable device of some description, when it will launch and what it will have to offer is unclear. Now, a new DigiTimes report claims that Apple continues to work on a foldable iPhone but the news isn't positive. According to that DigiTimes report, Apple has moved some of the Apple Vision Pro engineers onto the foldable iPhone program but there is now an expectation that it will launch either in the fourth quarter of 2026 or the first quarter of 2027; That means that anyone hoping to buy a foldable iPhone is going to be waiting a good long while before it arrives. If, indeed, it ever does. Apple is thought to be concerned that the current state of foldable display technology still isn't in a position to be able to offer the kind of experience that Apple wants. While there are tons of foldable phones and the displays have improved considerably in recent generations, there is still a notable crease across foldable devices. It's thought that Apple could choose to delay the project indefinitely while the crease situation is ironed out and new hinge designs are produced. While the report discusses a foldable iPhone, Apple is also thought to be working on a foldable laptop or tablet device with a foldable 20-inch display. It's unclear what this latest news means for that device, however.

An OLED iPad Pro and the first big-screen iPad Air will reportedly arrive in May,2024-03-28T20:40:56+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/an-oled-ipad-pro-and-the-first-big-screen-ipad-air-will-reportedly-arrive-in-may-204056132.html?src=rss,"Apple will finally launch new iPads in early May, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Expected are a new iPad Pro with an OLED display and a faster iPad Air, including a 12.9-inch model for the first time in that lineup. The details of the upcoming iPad models have been consistent, circulating through the rumor mill since last year. The new iPad Pro models will reportedly add OLED displays (offering deeper blacks and richer colors) and run on the new M3 chip, already found in several Macs. The new tablets are said to launch alongside a redesigned Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. Other than a white color option, the latter has remained unchanged since its arrival four years ago. Meanwhile, the iPad Air will supposedly run on a new processor. Bloomberg didn’t specify which, but — considering the current model uses the M1, and Apple likely wants to reserve the M3 for the more expensive Pro — the M2 sounds like a safe bet. The 12.9-inch screen option would mark the first time the iPad Air line has offered a display larger than 10.9 inches. Although Apple will charge more for that model than the smaller sibling expected alongside it, that would be the cheapest way yet to get a supersized iPad screen. Gurman said early this month that the new tablets would launch alongside the M3 MacBook Air, but the laptop arrived without any iPads in tow. He now reports that Apple’s release schedule was pushed back to finish working on the devices’ software and ironing out the kinks from the “complex new manufacturing techniques” they require. Apple's AirPods Pro (second-generation) are $60 off in a deal on Amazon, bringing the price don to just $190. The AirPods Pro normally cost $250.

If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. THE ORGANISED CRIME Branch of the PSNI today seized over 20,000 counterfeit Apple and electronic items in Belfast and Portadown in Co Armagh. The seized goods consisted of counterfeit AirPods, Apple chargers, iPhones, smartwatches, mobile phones, phone cases, charging cables and vapes. A sum of cash was also seized. The PSNI said the products represented an estimated loss to Apple and the other high street brands of £600,000 (€702,000). A PSNI spokesperson said the investigation stemmed from seizures made in December 2023 in the East Midlands. Today’s operation resulted in a 24-year-old man being arrested in Portadown on suspicion of immigration offences. Advertisement

 He has been taken to Musgrave Police Station for questioning. The spokesperson added: “The criminals will attempt to copy anything, from clothing and jewellery to, in this case, electronic items. “Some consumers may unwittingly buy counterfeit goods, while others – pleased to have snatched an affordable replica – will be unaware of the hidden implications.” However, the spokesperson said the “grim reality is that proceeds from the sale of counterfeit goods often fund serious organised crime, including drug dealing, money laundering and human trafficking”. The spokesperson also noted that there are health and safety risks associated with the use of some counterfeit goods, including electrical items.  “These items don’t undergo the testing and quality control that genuine items do,” the spokesperson said. “A counterfeit phone charger, for example, won’t meet fire safety standards, and the attraction of ‘saving’ a few pounds could end up costing you your home.” The spokesperson also warned that the majority of fake goods are produced in sweatshops where “vulnerable individuals work tirelessly in horrific conditions, and get paid a pittance in return”.

Apple Sues Former Engineer for Leaking Products He Hated to 'Homeboy',2024-03-28T20:32:00+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/apple-sues-former-engineer-leaking-products-he-hated-1851372842,"Apple filed a lawsuit earlier this month against former software engineer Andrew Aude, alleging he leaked info about products he wanted to “kill” to a journalist saved in his phone as “Homeboy.” The secret projects included Apple’s new Journal app and the Vision Pro, first reported by MacRumors Thursday. The former Apple software engineer shared over 1,400 Signal messages with “Homeboy,” Aude’s secret name for a Wall Street Journal reporter, according to filings. Apple alleges Aude leaked Apple’s journaling app in April 2023 to the Wall Street Journal because he wanted the project “killed.” Aaron Tilley published a WSJ article on the app at that time. Aude also shared “over 10,000 text messages” with a journalist from The Information. This was all conducted on Aude’s company-issued iPhone. Aude is accused of breaking the company’s confidentiality agreement, and Apple seeks $25,000 in damages. At one point, Aude referred to his leaking of information as a “necessary evil” and that he eagerly anticipated the “chaos” that would ensue. He hoped his actions would cause a stir before “Apple’s corporate people even woke up.” Apple alleges Aude was malicious and willful in what products he leaked. Aude also leaked details about the Apple Vision Pro back in Oct. 2020, despite Apple. In Aug. 2021, the software engineer confirmed rumors about a design feature of an unreleased Apple device, noting that it was “one of Apple’s best secret features.” Aude got caught in Nov. 2023, when a manager asked him if he’d been leaking information to journalists. He denied the accusation and then ran to the bathroom to delete much of his evidence, according to the court filing. A month later, Aude admitted that he leaked tons of information from Apple, and he was fired in December. Apple claims that all of Aude’s leaks were purposeful and the software engineer still poses a threat to the company, even though he no longer works there. Apple says his history of leaking info and his deep knowledge of company secrets make him an ongoing security risk. Apple is subject to a lot of leaks, partially because the company has so many secret projects. The company sued and imprisoned a former engineer for stealing Apple’s driverless car technology. In that case, the FBI was forced to get involved to stop a man from fleeing with trade secrets to China.",-2
Google just spilled when RCS will finally land on iPhone,2024-03-28T20:19:02+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/google-just-spilled-when-rcs-will-finally-land-on-iphone-4513169,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience. If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. Apple’s long-awaited adoption of RCS messaging to enable better and safer communications between iPhone and Android users will finally happen this autumn. The news comes via a Google Messages homepage (via 9to5Google) that promises “better messaging for all” when Apple does add the Rich Communications Services standard. The page also says Apple has announced when it’ll happen: “Apple has announced it will be adopting RCS in the fall of 2024. Once that happens, it will mean a better messaging experience for everyone.” AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C for under £200 AirPods Pro 2 are still at the top of the tree when it comes to Apple-friendly noise cancelling buds. They’re down to £199 again for a limited time in Currys’ Easter weekend sale.
 AirPods Pro 2 are still at the top of the tree when it comes to Apple-friendly noise cancelling buds. They’re down to £199 again for a limited time in Currys’ Easter weekend sale. However, Apple is yet to publicly confirm this, despite what Google says. While Apple has said the adoption will happen “later” in 2024, it has not narrowed this down to a window. Autumn wouldn’t be a surprise though. There are expectations Apple will include RCS for iPhone in the forthcoming iOS 18 update, which is due this September. If that is the case, we’re likely to hear about RCS on iPhone in June when Apple takes the stage for the WWDC keynote where it is likely to reveal iOS 18’s key features. When RCS does arrive on the iPhone, it’ll somewhat (but not completely) level the playing field between iPhone and Android users when it comes to texting. Although iPhone-to-iPhone messaging will still be handled by iMessage, but messages across platforms will benefit from high res photos and videos, live typing indicators, read reports, proper reactions, and end-to-end encryption. It’s a long overdue concession from Apple, which has long been accused to fostering an inferior cross-platform messaging experience to encourage iMessage (and hence iPhone adoption). Now Apple has EU regulators sniffing around all aspects of its business to ensure it isn’t abusing its dominant market position, Apple has compromised by adopting RCS to replace the ancient and, frankly, unsafe SMS standard.

Apple will confirm iOS 18 during its WWDC 2024 keynote address in June. Rumors suggest it will be a substantial upgrade for iPhone users. The final iOS 18 release date won’t land for awhile, but iPhone users will be able to try the software out long before the final version arrives. The final version will land in the fall, probably in September alongside the iPhone 16 series, but you’ll be able to try the software in June when Apple releases the first iOS 18 beta. The iOS 18 beta will be an early version of the operating system. It will give developers, and those enrolled in Apple’s Beta Software Program, a chance to try new features and test performance before the official version arrives. Installing the iOS 18 beta right away might be tempting, but a lot of you will want either wait for the public beta or stay put on iOS 17. Unfinished software has the potential to cause problems on your iPhone. If you decide to install the iOS 18 beta, you’ll want to prepare. This is particularly true if this will be your first time using iOS beta software on your device. Table of Contents With that in mind, here are some tips that will come in handy as we push toward the iOS 18 beta’s release. Apple’s confirmed the dates for WWDC 2024 which means we now know when it will release the first iOS 18 beta.  WWDC 24 kicks off on June 10th. Apple will use the conference’s keynote to highlight the changes coming to iPhone with iOS 18. It will also confirm key information about the beta. We expect Apple to push the first iOS 18 beta to developers on June 10th. You can expect it to arrive after the keynote ends in the early afternoon. The public beta usually comes later. Typically Apple releases the first public beta in July and we may see similar timing this year. Keep these times in mind if you plan to install the iOS 18 beta on your iPhone. Given that iOS 18 isn’t official, the only way to get familiar with the operating system right now is via the rumor mill. Fortunately, we’ve seen a ton of information leak. Start there.  Most people will simply want to watch the WWDC 24 keynote live stream or the playback once Apple releases it. The company will again outline iOS 18’s components during the show and it should release a full-blown guide to iOS 18 once the beta is out. If you want to take things a step further, you can download the iOS 18 beta on your iPhone and go hands-on with all of the changes before the final release in the fall. While we wait, read through Apple’s rules regarding its beta programs.  If you decide to download the developer beta, get familiar with Apple’s beta website for developers. The website goes over everything you need to know about joining the developer program and everything you need to adhere to once you’re in. If you’re more interested in the public iOS 18 beta, you need to join the Beta Software Program...",2
Can the Warriors continue to withstand Draymond Green’s antics? | No Cap Room,2024-03-28T20:02:37+00:00,https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/video/warriors-continue-withstand-draymond-green-200237429.html,"Yahoo Sports senior NBA reporter Jake Fischer and senior NBA writer Dan Devine discuss how Golden State has walked the tightrope that is Draymond Green this season after the power forward’s early ejection in the Warriors’ win over the Orlando Magic. Hear the full conversation on “No Cap Room” - part of the “Ball Don’t Lie” podcast - and subscribe on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen. JAKE FISCHER: Draymond Green being ejected early yet again. And I guess all I have to say on that is at least it was because he was arguing with an official and not physically damaging an opponent. That's the one positive to say maybe. DAN DEVINE: Yeah, I mean, baby steps, right? Baby steps in terms of we're all trying to get better. We're all working on things. As Kelly Oubre said, we're all trying to represent God in the best way we can. And you know, Draymond didn't get there last night. Yeah, no one got yoked, so there's something to be said for that. You could just see-- it was less than four minutes into the game. And the Warriors have been-- they've had some blow-out losses. They are now seeing the Rockets racing up behind them. They're so-- this is a team that we expect so much of. They expect so much of themselves. And for them to be like, can we cling to 10th is just like-- they're in such dire straits there. And so for this to be the way that game starts, it's so deflating. You could see the clip-- and I think I saw it through NBC Sports Warriors, that Twitter account. But it's all over the place, Steph Curry's reaction after Draymond gets run. And he's got his jersey over his face. He's shaking his head. He's staring at the ground. Bruce Fraser coming over, patting him on the back. The amount-- the amount of frustration-- JAKE FISCHER: And he did maul Patty Mills the night before. That's a very-- that's part of the context of the ref joke I made. DAN DEVINE: Yeah. No, fair, fair. And I mean-- and to do that to Patty Mills, of all people, my goodness. But you felt the weight of all of the time Steph Curry has been going to bat for Draymond. And all of-- everything that everybody has said. They go to the mattresses for him because they know he's worth it. They go the extra mile for him because they know he's worth it. And I know I've written about it earlier in the season. We've talked about it ad nauseam, that feeling of he is the person who gives them their sort of snarl and their edge and also just high-level defensive play that was absent when he was gone. He makes the offense click in a different way. But then when the double-edged sword cuts you, like it did there, you could just see how hard that was for Steph. And then after the game, he's asked what he can say about it, you know, what his reaction was, what the frustration was. And it was just, all I'll say is we need him. He knows that. We all know that. So whatever it takes to keep him on the floor and be available, that's what's got to happen. You don't want to have self-inflicted w...",0
How Intel and Microsoft are teaming up to take on Apple,2024-03-28T20:02:23+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/intel-and-microsoft-worked-together-on-lunar-lake/,"It seems like Apple might need to watch out, because Intel and Microsoft are coming for it after the latter two companies reportedly forged a close partnership during the development of Intel Lunar Lake chips. Lunar Lake refers to Intel’s upcoming generation of mobile processors that are aimed specifically at the thin and light segment. While the specs are said to be fairly modest, some signs hint that Lunar Lake may have enough of an advantage to pose a threat to some of the best processors. Today’s round of Intel Lunar Lake leaks comes from Igor’s Lab. The system-on-a-chip (SoC), pictured above, is Intel’s low-power solution made for thin laptops that’s said to be coming out later this year. Curiously, the chips weren’t manufactured on Intel’s own process, but on TSMC’s N3B node. This is an interesting development because Intel typically sticks to its own fabs, and it even plans to sell its manufacturing services to rivals like AMD. This time, however, Intel opted for the N3B node for its compute tile. The chip also sports Intel’s next-gen Arc Battlemage integrated graphics, which are said to come with a maximum of 64 Xe2 execution units (EUs) and eight Xe2 cores.  Rumor has it that Lunar Lake will also offer up to 32GB of LPDDR5X-8533 memory which will be directly integrated into the SoC. This saves a lot of space — according to Tom’s Hardware, anywhere between 100 and 250 square millimeters. It also has a six-tile neural processing unit (NPU). At maximum, the SoC is rumored to sport a CPU with a total of eight cores — four performance and four efficiency. Those are rookie numbers compared to chips like the high-end Core i9-13900K, but Lunar Lake stands in a league of its own, where it will only need to compete against the likes of Apple’s M3. To that end, it appears that Intel is coming to the battlefield armed to the teeth. Igor’s Lab teased that Intel has been working closely with Microsoft, and that the development of Lunar Lake CPUs was more of a team effort than one might expect. The goal was to make Lunar Lake CPUs work particularly well with Windows 11. The details of what Intel and Microsoft cooked up together are still unclear, but it’s definitely a step in the right direction. Apple’s own silicon, as well as its own ecosystem, is part of what pushes some consumers toward getting a MacBook instead of a Windows-based laptop. If Intel and Microsoft managed to work out a solution that could push Lunar Lake to the next level when used with Windows, it might become a force to be reckoned with later this year. Apple’s Vision Pro is just a couple of days from landing on people’s heads, with many speculating how much of a success -- or not -- the tech giant can make of its most important product launch in years. A key factor is expected to be the level of interest developers show in creating custom-made apps for the mixed-reality headset, with some major platforms such as Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube deciding to hold back from offering besp...",-2

But launching new hardware too.  Ship an iPhone 16 globally without any version of iOS installed on the device that only activates on launch date. No leaks to the press and any rogue supply chain employee will just get a brick that won't power on. this is all about Apple's supply chain having the latest bleeding edge release build on a device prior to sale. As a consumer you'd still have to sync all your apps from the cloud but at least it might save, say, a 200MB download fetching the latest OS updates. Nobody wants to wait on Christmas morning while their new phone updates. This ""zero value"" proclamation seems to be becoming a common thing. It's dumb. Because you want to use some feature that's in the latest version. But hey, I'm sure you're right and Apple is wrong. A $3 trillion company that specializes in attention to detail, or ""superdave80"" who's typing in one word sentences in all caps on an Internet chat site. A $3 trillion company that specializes in attention to detail/quote.
Is that what you really think they 'specialize' in?  Because I could fill a long post with all the things wrong with my iPhone, most of which exist because of incompetency or trying to get more money/control.  ""Attention to detail"" is not one of the things they prioritize. A $3 trillion company that specializes in attention to detail/quote.

Not that I don't trust Apple, but my bet is that spy agencies have had this tech for a decade already :) At Apple Stores, if you walk in, and buy a new phone, and trade in your old phone at the same time, they'll help you transfer all your data over. They'll take you to the back of the store and sit you down and make sure everything goes correctly. They'll even make sure your new phone is running the latest OS. They want your experience to be as perfect as possible. This is absolutely fantastic for normals. The whole process goes much faster if the new phone is already updated to the latest OS. It's great for c  Not because Apple would do this in store but because it implies there is some sort of remote control capability that a Bad Actor could possibly hook into to do something Bad to customer owned phones.

"Logan Paul Rips Graham Bensinger Over Documentary, You Promised Apple TV+",2024-03-28T19:45:43+00:00,https://www.tmz.com/2024/03/28/logan-paul-graham-bensinger-documentary-suicide-apple-tv-fight/,"Logan Paul is beyond pissed about the new documentary about him that just dropped ... and he's blaming Graham Bensinger, the guy who spent 5 months interviewing him for the film. We had Logan and Graham on ""TMZ Live"" Thursday, and we thought they were both going to promote, ""5 Months with Logan Paul"" ... the documentary -- in which Logan opens up about suicidal thoughts after a failed business deal. Well, instead it turned into a verbal Royal Rumble, with Logan hurling a lot of accusations at Graham. His main beef is the platform on which '5 Months' debuted ... namely, Graham's YouTube channel. Logan ripped into Graham, claiming he'd promised it would debut on Apple TV+. Dude came with receipts, too -- Logan held up several emails he claims Graham sent him about the Apple TV+ deal. For his part, Graham claims he notified Logan's manager 4 months ago that the Apple TV+ deal had fallen apart, and the doc would be on YouTube. Logan was still incensed Graham never spoke to him about it. For his part, Graham says he did reach out to Logan, personally, by text on November 30 -- 10 days after he'd informed Logan's manager about the change -- and asked him to call back. Graham says he never heard from Logan. Logan's other issue is he feels bamboozled, as he ranted to us about giving Graham unprecedented access to his life and the people closest to him ... including his fiancée Nina Agdal and his brother, Jake Paul. He says he wouldn't have participated so fully, if at all, had he known the Apple deal was dead. Graham points out his Logan interview isn't ONLY available on YouTube, as it will also air on TV stations across the country that carry his show ... which include NBC, FOX, ABC and CBS affiliates. In the end, they went at each other for a very intense 10+ minutes -- we've got an abbreviated version in this post, but you can see the full showdown on Thursday's ""TMZ Live.""

iOS 18 Update: What to Know Right Now,2024-03-28T19:33:38+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/ios-18-release-date-rumors-beta-info/,"Published on By If you’re curious about the next version of iOS, we’ll take you through everything you need to know right now about Apple’s upcoming iOS 18 update for iPhone.  iOS 18 rumors have already outlined potential upgrades coming to the iPhone later this year. Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman says internally, iOS 18 is viewed as one of the biggest, if not the biggest, iOS updates in the company’s history. Armed with that information, and years of experience covering Apple’s software, we can put together an early look at what to expect from iOS 18 and its release. Table of Contents If you’ve owned an iPhone for a long time, you may know some of this already. If you haven’t, or you’re simply looking to set proper expectations, here’s what you need to know right now. Perhaps the biggest question on everyone’s mind is this one: Which iPhones will get iOS 18? Here’s what we can tell you. Apple won’t confirm a full list of iOS 18 eligible iPhone models until WWDC 24 in June, but you can expect most, if not all, iOS 17-powered devices to get the upgrade. There are, however, a few iPhone models that could potentially be on the chopping block. iPhones typically get software upgrades for five or six years before they get left behind. For instance, the iPhone X, iPhone 8, and iPhone 8 Plus, all of which launched in 2017 with iOS 11 on board, are stuck on iOS 16. They didn’t get upgraded to iOS 17. That being said, they will continue to get new upgrades with security patches throughout 2024.  If Apple sticks to this protocol in 2024, the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR, which launched a year after the iPhone X and iPhone 8, may get stuck on iOS 17. Again, we won’t know for sure until June. A rumor suggests all iOS 17-powered iPhone models will make the move to iOS 18 in the fall. This source has a proven track record which means iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR owners can breathe a sigh of relief. For now. Below is a list of iPhones that should get upgraded to iOS 18. Given their age, none of these phones are in danger of missing the upgrade. iOS 18 Eligible iPhone Models We’ll add the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR to the list if we see other reports corroborate the information. Speaking of WWDC, that’s when you can expect Apple to confirm iOS 18 for the first time. WWDC 24 kicks off on June 10th this year.  Apple typically pushes the first version of an iOS operating system’s beta to developers on the first day of WWDC. In other words, you can expect the first iOS 18 beta to roll out on June 10th. Unless Apple changes things up, there will be two versions of the iOS 18 beta: A developer beta and a public beta for users registered for the Beta Software Program. The developer beta usually arrives a few weeks before the public beta. In the past, Apple’s launched public betas in July so that’s what you should expect at this point. The iOS 18 beta will stretch over several months. We can’t predict how many versions of the beta we’l...",1
We now know when Apple is adding RCS to the iPhone,2024-03-28T19:31:46+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/we-know-when-apple-is-adding-rcs-to-the-iphone-fall-2024-news/,"Last November, Apple made a surprise announcement when it confirmed that RCS was coming to the iPhone in 2024. It’s something iPhone and Android phone users alike have been waiting years for, but there was just one small problem: Apple never said when in 2024 RCS was coming. Thanks to Google, of all companies, we now have a better idea of when RCS is heading to the iPhone. As spotted by 9to5Google, the Android website was recently updated with a new page dedicated to Google Messages. If you click on the “See more features” button for the section talking about RCS, there’s a section titled “Better messaging for all” with the following text: “Apple has announced it will be adopting RCS in the fall of 2024. Once that happens, it will mean a better messaging experience for everyone.” When Apple announced RCS support in November, all it said was that RCS was coming “later next year.” Google’s statement of this fall doesn’t provide an exact date, but it does give us a tighter release window. Assuming Apple’s plans don’t change between now and then, this means we should expect RCS to arrive on the iPhone in September, October, or November. This means RCS will almost certainly be a part of Apple’s upcoming iOS 18 update. Apple is expected to announce iOS 18 during WWDC 2024 this June, with the public release likely to coincide with the iPhone 16 launch in September. It’s possible we may have to wait until a “point” update like iOS 18.1 or iOS 18.2, but it shouldn’t go beyond that. When RCS arrives on the iPhone, texting between iPhones and Android phones will be a much better experience than it is today. RCS will make conversations with Android users very similar to iMessage ones — adding things like typing indicators, read receipts, high-resolution photo sharing, better group chats, and more. There’s still a while to go before we get to fall and can finally use these things, but the light is finally at the end of the tunnel. The iPhone 15 lineup — which includes the standard iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Pro — is the iPhone at its best. It's the latest series of iPhones available today and the default choice if you're buying a new iPhone in 2024. But it’s not the only choice of iPhones you can purchase. In fact, Apple still sells the iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and the iPhone SE on its website. You could also find other iPhone models available – refurbished or new — from other retailers or carrier stores. If rumors are to be believed, iOS 18 will allow you to customize the home screen on your iPhone more substantially than ever before. This feature will be familiar to Android phone owners, but I don’t want my iPhone to look like an Android phone. It’s a weird double-edged sword, as by giving you more freedom to make the home screen look unique, iOS may also lose what makes it unique compared to the less constrained world of Android.
iOS 18 and your iPhone home screen Apple has just announced the dates for its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024. WWDC wi...",2
A $3 app shoots better spatial videos than the iPhone’s native camera,2024-03-28T19:30:55+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/a-3-app-shoots-better-spatial-videos-than-the-iphones-native-camera-193055951.html?src=rss,"A $3 iOS app now records higher-resolution spatial videos than Apple’s native camera app. Spatialify, available on the App Store, lets iPhone 15 Pro owners record 3D videos for Apple’s Vision Pro in either 1080p at 60fps or 4K at 30fps — with HDR. Apple’s native recording only supports 1080p / 30fps without HDR, so your immersive clips will be noticeably sharper using Spatialify than the camera app on the same phone. UploadVR first reported on the app update. Spatialify launched earlier this year as a tool for converting Apple’s spatial videos (HEVC format) for playback on non-Apple VR headsets like the Meta Quest 3. But with Meta later adding native HEVC conversion to its headsets (the best-selling on the market), Spatialify’s superior recording could give the third-party app a new lease on life. Engadget senior editor Devindra Hardawar confirmed that Spatialify produces files in 4K / 30fps when set accordingly. He also verified that Spatialify’s videos look much sharper on the Vision Pro than those shot in Apple’s camera app. HDR also makes the videos’ lighting look more realistic. Not bad for three bucks. It’s somewhat surprising Apple is holding back its native camera app from exploiting the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max’s full hardware capabilities, but it isn’t unheard of. Halide, a popular iOS camera app, beat Apple to the punch with iOS photography features like shooting in RAW, manual controls and portrait photos for pets. Based on that history, I wouldn’t be shocked if Apple soon added similar advanced spatial recording to its camera, especially now that we know its current hardware has no problem with it. Spatialify is available on the App Store for $3. It requires an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max to capture spatial videos. Apple's AirPods Pro (second-generation) are $60 off in a deal on Amazon, bringing the price don to just $190. The AirPods Pro normally cost $250. They come with active noise cancellation, adaptive audio, and personalized spatial audio. To find out all the details of watching and recording the total solar eclipse on April 8, read on. Former Geek Squad workers who lost their jobs this week told 404 Media that Best Buy is conducting mass layoffs, though no numbers have yet been confirmed.

Apple Plans New iPad Pro For May As Production Ramps Up Overseas,2024-03-28T19:03:38+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/when-is-the-new-ipad-pro-ipad-air-coming-out-apple-plans-early-may-launch,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s overseas suppliers have ramped up production of the company’s long-anticipated new iPads and a launch is planned for early May, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  The release will center on revamped versions of the iPad Pro and iPad Air, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans aren’t public. As Bloomberg News has previously reported, the Pro models will get crisper new OLED displays — short for organic light-emitting diode — while the iPad Air will get a 12.9-inch screen option for the first time.  The move marks an end to the longest stretch without new models in the history of the iPad, which was first introduced by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs in 2010. It’s been about 18 months since the last updates — a drought that’s contributed to already-sluggish demand for tablets. Apple is betting that the new models, with faster chips and revamped accessories, can help spur a renaissance for the category. After a run-up during the pandemic, iPad sales have fallen in each of Apple’s last two fiscal years, which run through September. They suffered an additional 25% year-over-year decline during the latest holiday period, when the devices have typically been popular gifts. A spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment. The iPad Pro models — codenamed J717, J718, J720 and J721 — will run the new M3 chip and work with redesigned versions of the Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil. The update represents the first overhaul to that lineup since 2018. The iPad Air, meanwhile, was last updated in 2022 with the M1 chip. It will get a new processor, and the 12.9-screen size means consumers can get a large iPad for less money than the more upscale Pro. The current iPad Air starts at $599, while the Pro line costs $200 more. Apple had planned to release the new iPads by the end of March or early April, but the company has been working to finish software for the devices. The screens in the latest models also require complex new manufacturing techniques, which have contributed to the delay.  An early May product release would come about a month before Apple’s next major event. On June 10, the company plans to kick off its weeklong Worldwide Developers Conference. There, Apple is expected to unveil a renewed artificial intelligence strategy — alongside software updates for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac and Vision Pro headset.

My 4 favorite music players for MacOS (that aren't Apple Music),2024-03-28T18:47:59+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-4-favorite-music-players-for-macos-that-arent-apple-music/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular I'm an audiophile. Although I prefer my music to be heard via the glory that is vinyl, there are times when I need to be out of my office and in another room of my home. When those moments arise, I'm using my MacBook Pro and I am here to tell you that I don't care for Apple Music. Why? It's too basic. Even the advanced options are not even remotely advanced. Also: How to add music recognition to your MacOS Menu Bar - no Siri needed! So, when I'm with my MacBook and I want to listen to locally-stored tunes, I turn to an alternative player. Fortunately, there are plenty of apps in the Mac App Store that serve this purpose.   I know this is all very subjective (as is the choice of music to be played via these apps), but these apps are likely to please most people. With that said, let's get this music fest started. The VLC media player isn't just for videos. In fact, VLC is perfectly at home playing music files, CDs, and even many streaming protocols. VLC is powerful, highly flexible, and can play nearly any audio file type you've got. VLC can play ASF, WMV, AU, AVI, OGG, MPG, MP3, WAV, DTS, XA, and many other file types. As far as features are concerned, you'll find plugin support, online radio, visualization effects, Last.fm support, and more. If you open Audio Effects (from the Window menu), you'll find EQ, compressor, spatializer, and filter options. VLC is one of my favorite all-around media players. You can install VLC from the Mac App Store for free. Do you miss the days of Winamp and XMMS? I certainly do. I not only loved their UIs, but the feature sets and size of these music players were just so spot-on for me.  If you're looking for an app to recapture that feeling, there's Pine Player. Although Pine Player doesn't nail the Winamp UI exactly, it's very close. You can view it in full or minimal mode and enjoy features like file conversion, meta info editing, playlists, playlist sorting, iTunes support, album art, crossfade, gapless playback, and more. Pine Player supports audio file types such as MP3, FLAC, APE, AAC, M4A, WAV, AIFF, OGG, WMA, DSD, SACD ISO, OPUS, and more.

 AirPods Pro 2 are still at the top of the tree when it comes to Apple-friendly noise cancelling buds. They’re down to £199 again for a limited time in Currys’ Easter weekend sale. Your first question is probably whether this AirPods Pro 2 model has the USB-C MagSafe Charging case, rather than Lightning? The answer is yes. This is the so-called AirPods Pro 2.1 update also includes an additional dust proof certification. They’re now IP54 rated for dust and water protection, while the previous edition had an IPX4 rating meaning no protection against dust. There’s also a 20-bit 48kHz lossless audio capacity for Vision Pro connectivity. With no prospect of another significant AirPods Pro 3 update this year, according to reports, you’ll be getting the latest version of the buds for the foreseeable future. There’s top-tier active noise cancelling technology, with the ability to adapt to your environment, easy device switching between Apple devices and a wirelessly charging case with a lanyard loop for safe keeping and a speaker for Find My alerts. Some of the best ANC earbuds around We also love the rich, warm sound and compact design without the long stems that defined the original AirPods. Naturally, there’s hands-free Siri and on-device touch controls that make control of media easy. The built in U1 chip offers the security of Precision Finding, similar to AirTag trackers. Our reviewer said the AirPods Pro 2 are a must-buy if you’re in the Apple ecosystem and you’re in need of great noise cancelling earphones. Max Parker wrote: “The ANC here is great, especially for cutting out the whir of trains and tubes. Considering the size of the buds, it’s impressive how much noise can be cut out and how smartly it adapts to the environment.” We gave these buds a 4.5-star review.

According to a reliable source, the launch has been delayed.  Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman dropped a bombshell report today and he says Apple’s now planning to release the OLED iPad Pro and iPad Air 6 in early May. Previously, all signs had pointed to an announcement, and release, in either late March or April so this news comes as a huge surprise. Gurman says Apple’s suppliers are ramping up production of the new iPads ahead of their release. Production is underway, but Apple still needs to work out some kinks. The company is working to finish software for the new devices and the OLED iPad Pro requires “complex new manufacturing techniques.” These, according to Gurman, contributed to the delay. The good news is they are still on track for the spring. Both the iPad Air 6 and new iPad Pro are expected to have numerous upgrades on board. 2024 iPad Pros iPad Air 6 The OLED iPad Pro is expected to jump up in price.

Trump due at Long Island wake for slain NYPD cop Jonathan Diller,2024-03-28T16:56:38+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/28/us-news/trump-due-at-long-island-wake-for-slain-nypd-cop-jonathan-diller/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Former President Donald Trump on Thursday will join grieving relatives and hundreds of uniformed officers at the wake for slain NYPD cop Jonathan Diller — as he continues to harp on rampant urban crime during his bid to reclaim the White House. Trump’s presence at the Massapequa funeral home promises to shine a spotlight on Diller’s senseless death during a traffic stop in Queens on Monday, with the slain cop serving as another tragic example.   It is unclear what led to Trump’s expected attendance at the wake.  “The county executive discussed this with the president on Tuesday,” Chris Boyle, a spokesman for Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, told The Post.  But Boyle would not say if that conversation included an invitation. Trump’s presidential campaign announced Wednesday that he would join Diller’s family and hundreds of police officers from New York City and the region at the Massapequa wake. “President Trump is moved by the invitation to join NYPD Officer Jonathan Diller’s family and colleagues as they deal with his senseless and tragic death,” said Karoline Leavitt, the former commander-in-chief’s campaign spokesperson. Trump has been persistently critical of City Hall and President Joe Biden over their presumed failure to curb rampant crime in the Big Apple.  In an exclusive interview with The Post’s Michael Goodwin earlier this month, Trump blamed the “radical lunatic left” for ruining American cities. “The local police are not allowed to do their jobs anymore,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago. He has blasted Democrat-run cities for “being destroyed by the migrants” — who have been behind headline-making crime sprees, including in New York City. “If you want to be a sanctuary city, then you’re not getting any federal money.” He is expected to cite the young cop’s shooting death as another example of runaway crime. Diller, a 31-year-old married dad, was on patrol in Far Rockaway on Monday when he was shot and mortally wounded by a ruthless ex-con and his career criminal pal, according to police. In just three years on the job, Diller had more than 70 busts under his belt and was part of what relatives called “the real Blue Bloods family” — a reference to the hit CBS hit series about a family of Big Apple police officers. Diller, whose brother-in-law and cousin are both cops, leaves behind a wife, Stephanie, and the couple’s 1-year-old son, Ryan. Visitation with Diller’s family will be held at the Massapequa Funeral Home at 4980 Merrick Road between 2 to 4 p.m. and 7 to 9 p.m. Thursday, followed by the same schedule Friday. His funeral is scheduled for Saturday at 10:30 a.m. at St. Rose of Lima R.C. Church, also in Massapequa, followed by burial at St. Charles Cemetery in Farmingdale immediately after the service. Police said accused cop killer Guy Rivera, who had 21 prior arrests, allegedly shot Diller in the stomach around 5:50 p.m. as the young cop approached the vehicle he w...",0

This list is in alphabetical order. It was last updated on March 28, 2024. It will update monthly. 2 / 34 Stars: Eugenio Derbez, Damián Alcázar, Enrique Arrizon, Chord Overstreet, Camila Perez, Fernando Carsa, Vanessa Bauche, Jessica Collins Number of seasons on Apple TV+: 2  Stream it now: Apple TV+ Inspired by the 2017 film How To Be A Latin Lover, Apple TV+’s Acapulco is one of the rare bilingual comedies on the platform. The show follows Máximo Gallardo, who gets his dream job as the cabana boy at the hottest resort in Acapulco, Mexico. But he soon realizes the job is far more demanding than he anticipated. A demanding clientele tends to do that. As mentioned in The A.V. Club’s review: “This winsome comedy is more concerned with the mostly Mexican employees of the fictional Las Colinas resort, many of whom grew up near it and have been irresistibly drawn to it since childhood.” Season three arrives in May.  3 / 34 Stars: Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, Zoë Chao, John Cho, Ben Schwartz, Jamie Demetriou, Ilana Glazer, Ken Jeong, Paul Walter Hauser, Anna Konkle Number of seasons: 2 Stream it now: Apple TV+ Who doesn’t love an enticing, funny murder mystery? Chris Miller’s star-studded series follows Detective Danner (Haddish) as she investigates a crime—and is told through the perspectives of different characters and genres. The second and final season, which wrapped in September, isn’t nearly as ace as the first, true, but it’s still a good time and is packed with some of our favorite comedy actors going for it.  4 / 34 Stars: Sharon Horgan, Anne-Marie Duff, Eve Birthistle, Sarah Greene, Eve Hewson, Daryl McCormack, Brian Gleeson, Claes Bang Number of seasons on Apple TV+: 1 Stream it now: Apple TV+ Created by Emmy-nominated Sharon Horgan,  Dave Finkel, and Brett Baer, the tragicomedy Bad Sisters is an instant standout.

Well then you’ll definitely want to check out this amazing deal over on Amazon.  Amazon is currently selling a 4-pack of AirTags at their best price ever. You can snag the 4-pack for $74.99 which is 24% off the regular price of $99.00. This is the first time we’ve seen the price drop this low in some time so now is the perfect time to pickup some extra AirTags or grab some for the first time. If you’d prefer to just buy a single AirTag for yourself or someone else, you can grab one for $19. This is also 24% off the regular price which is $29.00.

Apple’s AirTags are small, lightweight devices you can attach to your wallet, bags, or other items you often misplace. The device leverages the company’s Find My network which allows users to locate their belongings using another Apple device like an iPhone.

If you’re looking for some of the best thin-and-light laptops on the market, these two devices are the pick of the bunch in 2024. We’ve fully reviewed the Apple MacBook Air M3 and Asus Zenbook 14 OLED. Here’s how they compare. 2024 is shaping up to be one of the most interesting years for the best thin-and-light laptops around. Intel Core Ultra and AMD Ryzen’s 8000 series have offered key boosts while the Apple M3 has brought some extra juice to Macs. The unknown quantity of the Snapdragon X Elite is closing in too. For now, the Zenbook 14 OLED and MacBook Air M3 are our top-rated machines for most people. These are what we think are all the key points of difference after our thorough testing. The pricing for the MacBook Air varies greatly depending on your desired configuration, as well as if you opt for the 13-inch or 15-inch models. The range starts at £1099/$1099 for the base 13-inch model, with the 15-inch starting at £1,299/$1,299. There are a lot of configurations so we won’t go through every single one of them here but the basics are that boosting up to a faster GPU will cost you £100 then going from 8GB unified memory to 16GB and then 32GB will cost you £200 for each step up. For a larger SSD, it costs £200 to go from 256GB to 512GB then again to 1TB before it’ll cost you another £400 for the extended rise to 2TB. Faster power adapters will also cost you £30.

 Currys is selling the iMac at a huge discount while stock lasts, with a price of £799.97. By comparison, things are simpler with the Asus, only offering one size, a smaller set of configurations and less expensive upgrades. The Asus Zenbook 14 OLED starts at £1,049 in the UK for the Intel Core Ultra 5 125H CPU, 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD model. In the US, the price varies, with a starting price of $1,299.99 on the Asus website for the same model but, at Best Buy, you get the more advanced Core Ultra 7 155H, 16GB RAM and 1TB SSD version for less at $1,049.99. In the UK, you can bump up the storage to 1TB for £200 then, with an additional £100, you can venture up to 32GB RAM and that raises the processor up to the Core Ultra 185H. Apple has long been the king of lightweight luxury design in the laptop space but brands like Asus are catching up. Both these laptops are super thin and light, with the MacBook Air coming in at 11.3mm thin and 1.24kg for the 13-inch model then 11.5mm thin and 1.51kg for the 15-inch. Next, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED measures 15mm thick and 1.29kg. So, the MacBook Air retains the edge in terms of thickness across both models but the 15-inch does come in a tad heavier.

MLS exec says Apple deal ‘finally’ gives them a TV partner invested in league growth,2024-03-28T15:00:48+00:00,https://awfulannouncing.com/mls/apple-deal-tv-partner-league-growth.html,"Awful Announcing There are obvious downsides to printing anonymous comments, but there can be benefits there as well. One of those advantages is increased candor from people when a comment doesn’t have their name attached. And if those people are sufficiently important, that can sometimes be interesting. The latest example of that comes from Tom Bogert and Paul Tenorio of The Athletic anonymously speaking to 30 chief soccer officers (not all with that exact title, but generally the people in charge of soccer operations for each team) across MLS. And it’s particularly seen in the comments they got on the Apple TV+ broadcasting deal, specifically with one exec taking a shot at past partners like ESPN and Fox Sports: Executives around MLS remain optimistic that Apple will help propel the league into a new era of growth. “The streaming play was the right one and we partnered with a company that wants to be innovative,” one said. “It was a huge step forward for the league,” said another. “Finally, we have a media partner who seems vested in the growth and improvement of the league.” While that’s probably not something those past media partners love to hear, the exec’s claim here has some support from an objective viewpoint. First off, Apple has significantly more games than any past partner. The most recent U.S. MLS media deal before last year’s Apple deal saw English broadcasts of national games split across ESPN and Fox, plus Spanish-language broadcasts on Univision and local broadcasts. Now, every game is produced by Apple and aired on AppleTV+’s MLS Season Pass globally. Some are also simulcast on Fox and Univision in the U.S., and on TSN and RDS in Canada, and some are available without an AppleTV+ or MLS Season Pass subscription, but MLS Season Pass is the league’s primary distribution for all games. So, just from a tonnage perspective, Apple is broadcasting much more MLS action than any individual company ever has. Tonnage alone doesn’t necessarily lead to investment, of course. If this was a minor deal for Apple, they wouldn’t really be strongly incentivized to grow and boost the league. But while a $2.5 billion deal (over 10 years) isn’t massive compared to the overall size of that tech behemoth (they had $119.58 billion in revenues and $33.92 billion in net income in the fourth quarter of 2023 alone), it is the biggest sports deal they’ve struck for AppleTV+ to date. And sports appears to be a key part of the strategy to try and grow that service. And the 10-year term and global rights here (very important considering Lionel Messi in particular) do give Apple notable incentive to try and boost the league. Having full control of the rights means they’ll reap all the broadcasting rewards from MLS growth, whereas past broadcasters would only have picked up a small portion of any enlarged pie. So it does seem fair to say they have more of a vested interest in growing the league than past broadcasters. Is that actually “a huge step forward”? That...",2
"If you get an unexpected call from Apple Support, you’re being hacked",2024-03-28T14:54:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3714823/if-you-get-an-unexpected-call-from-apple-support-youre-being-hacked.html#tk.rss_all,"
				“Just hang up,” Apple’s support website says as a social engineering phishing attack goes wild.			  Have you ever had an unexpected direct phone call from Apple support? I have not, and if you do ever receive one, you probably aren’t talking to Apple. The company says you should immediately hang up. “If you get an unsolicited or suspicious phone call from someone claiming to be from Apple or Apple Support, just hang up,” the company support website states. Other things it warns against are suspicious calendar invitations in Mail or Calendar, annoying pop-ups in the browser, unexpected software download prompts, and fraudulent emails.[ How to choose the right UEM platform ] The company offers up reporting tools you can use to tell Apple if you experience any of these, and if you have had such experiences, you should report them. What makes this advice relevant right now is a new phishing scam in operation in which people are receiving convincing looking Apple ID password reset warnings, sometimes followed by unsolicited calls claiming to be from Apple. It’s an attempt to abuse the Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) system Apple’s devices are protected by. Critical to understanding the nature of this attack is knowing that if you are targeted by it, you have probably already been selected as an attack target. These are relatively organized attempts, and whoever is behind an attack will already have researched for some details about the victim. That’s because they need to have the email address and phone number associated with your Apple ID. Those details may come from data brokers and people search websites, such as PeopleDataLabs, KrebsOnSecurity suggested earlier this week. The attackers need to have sourced information about the target to come across as genuine in the all-important phone call during which they con the target into sharing the reset code. In other words, these are highly tactical, planned attacks in which hackers have assembled large quantities of personal data. Michael Covington, VP of Portfolio Strategy at Jamf puts it this way: “MFA bombing presents a challenge to any targeted user, as they are forced to sift through a deluge of notifications with the fear of being victimized further if just one mistake is made. “What they don’t realize, however, is that this attack is typically preceded by a successful compromise of the user’s credentials, thus allowing a hacker to initiate the sign-in process.” Jamf recently warned that many Apple-using businesses are still soft targets for such attemps. There are some simple ways to protect yourself against these kinds of social-engineering enhanced attacks: If you experience an attack like this, you should report them using details provided by Apple support. Reporting is a vital protection against attacks like these. If everyone does report them, Apple’s systems can more swiftly be tweaked to intercept such attacks.

Here’s Apple’s 916-page appeal over the Apple Watch ban,2024-04-05T23:05:59+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122407/apple-watch-masimo-itc-appeal-smartwatch-wearables,"By  Victoria Song, a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 11 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine. There was no question that Apple would appeal when the International Trade Commission banned Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 sales last year. Well, if you’ve got some time, you can now read all 916 pages of Apple’s appeal to the Federal Circuit.  A quick recap: the Apple Watch ban centers around whether Apple infringed upon medical device-maker Masimo’s pulse oximetry patents. The ITC sided with Masimo, concluding that Apple had infringed their patents, and that the infringement was harming domestic industry.  The ITC is an agency similar to a court that often deals with imported “articles” that may or may not violate intellectual property law. The word “article” matters more than you’d think, since the statute that created the ITC specifies that it has jurisdiction over “articles.” Not to get too into the weeds, but a good chunk of Apple’s appeal argues: what domestic industry? And what articles? The appeal brief claims that not only was Masimo primarily known for clinical pulse oximeters, it didn’t even have an actual smartwatch when the complaint was filed. The smartwatch in question is Masimo’s W1 smartwatch, which launched in 2022. Masimo filed with the ITC in 2021, and according to Apple’s brief, Masimo only provided CAD drawings as evidence. In the 2015 case ClearCorrect Operating, LLC v. International Trade Commission, the Federal Circuit ruled that 3D models sent over the internet don’t count as “articles,” and aren’t subject to ITC jurisdiction. Basically, Apple’s trying to argue that there was no real case at the time the ITC complaint was filed — no watches, no “articles,” no domestic industry — and therefore the ban should be thrown out.  The 916 pages filed today include a 68 page brief, the 300+ page ITC decision being appealed, hundreds of eye-watering pages from the Patent Office, and more.  The big takeaway though is that Apple seems concerned that if this decision should hold, Masimo’s route may become an attractive strategy for others. “If the Commission’s decision is affirmed, the door of the agency’s ‘trade forum’ will be opened to complainants who lack an actual domestic industry but possess pleading creativity and CAD software. That is not what Congress intended and not what the statutory text permits,” reads the brief. It has reason to be concerned. At least one other medical tech company, AliveCor, has turned to the ITC to ban Apple Watches. The ITC also ruled that Apple infringed on AliveCor’s EKG tech and issued an import ban. Biden also refused to veto that ban, but AliveCor is currently appealing a Patent Trial and Appeals Board ruling that says its tech isn’t actually patentable.  For now, Apple has gotten around the import ban by selling modified versions of the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 that disables the blood oxygen tech. It’s li...",-2
5 Reasons to Wait for Apple Watch 10 & 5 Reasons Not To,2024-04-05T22:04:02+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/5-reasons-to-wait-for-apple-watch-10-4-reasons-not-to/,"Published on By Apple’s reportedly working on a new Apple Watch for 2024. The Apple Watch 10 release date is still a long way out, but you still might want to hold of on an upgrade and wait for the new model. Last year, Apple released the new Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Both are solid additions to the company’s Watch lineup, but bigger changes could be in store this year. Reports have outlined two new models: A new Apple Watch SE 3 and a higher-end model dubbed Apple Watch 10 or, perhaps, Apple Watch X. The name Apple Watch X would be used to mark the Watch’s 10th anniversary. If you recall, Apple did something similar for the iPhone for its 10th anniversary. That’s where the iPhone X’s name comes from.  We’re just months removed from the Apple Watch 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 launch, but we’ve already seen quite a bit of back and forth regarding the 2024 models. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, a primary source of these rumors, claims Apple’s working on a major overhaul and that it could come in the form of a new Apple Watch X. Apple’s original Apple Watch was announced back in 2014 and launched in 2015 so Gurman isn’t sure if the device will launch in 2024 or in 2025. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is another source talking about this year’s Apple Watch lineup and he claims the devices are “unlikely” to offer “significant innovative experiences.” It’s a bit confusing right now, as it typically is months before Apple releases a new product, and that might have some of you on edge. Apple Watch 10 rumors put those of you searching for a new smartwatch in a tough position: Buy now or wait and see what Apple’s got up its sleeve in 2024. If that question is rattling around in your brain, allow us to help. Table of Contents In this guide we’ll take you through the best reasons to consider waiting for the Apple Watch 10 and the best reasons to go with another device long before it arrives. Gurman believes Apple is targeting 2024 for a blood pressure monitor on the Apple Watch. This is the earliest it will launch and there could be a delay. That being said, it’s a feature worth waiting for. He’s outlined three health features Apple’s working on: glucose and blood sugar monitoring, the ability to take blood pressure, and the ability to measure body temperature. Of these, it looks like the blood pressure tool is the closest to launch. If this pans out, the Apple Watch 10 would be able to detect a user’s blood pressure from the wrist using infrared light. If you have blood pressure issues, or simply want a quick way to check, this feature alone might be worth the wait. In addition to blood pressure monitoring, the next Apple Watch is expected to gain sleep apnea detection.  Mark Gurman’s outlined the change in a lengthy piece about Apple’s focus on health and he says “it will use sleep and breathing patterns to estimate whether someone has the condition. Gurman also says the Watch will then direct users to see a physician if necessary. This is the first tim...",2
Apple lays off more than 600 workers in California in its first major round of post-pandemic cuts,2024-04-05T22:02:15+00:00,https://japantoday.com/category/business/apple-lays-off-more-than-600-workers-in-california-in-its-first-major-round-of-post-pandemic-cuts,"

 Apple is laying off more than 600 workers in California, marking the company's first big wave of post-pandemic job cuts amid a broader wave of tech industry consolidation.  The iPhone maker notified 614 workers in multiple offices on March 28 that they were losing their jobs, with the layoffs becoming effective on May 27, according to reports to regional authorities.  The workers were cut from eight offices in Santa Clara, according to the filings under the state's Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, also known as WARN. But it's not clear which departments or projects the employees were involved in.  Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Friday.  The Cupertino, California, company had been a notable exception as other tech companies slashed their workforces over the past two years. There was a massive surge in hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people spent more time and money online, and big tech companies are still larger than they were before the pandemic. Still, as growth slows, companies are focusing on cutting costs to bolster their bottom lines.  Amazon announced earlier this week a fresh round of layoffs, this time at its cloud computing business AWS. In recent months, video game maker Electronic Arts said it's cutting about 5% of its workforce, Sony said its axing about 900 jobs in its PlayStation division, Cisco Systems revealed plans to lay off more than 4,000 workers and social media company Snap, owner of Snapchat, announced its slashing 10% of its global workforce.

Grotesque article which is plain disinformation. It’s well understood that those lay-offs are related to project reorganizations primarily with the car project which Apple recently stopped. It has nothing to do with COVID or having hired too many people during that period (actually Apple did not). Stop to always bring everything to damn COVID, this is ridiculous. Apple executives failed to make profit for the projects they ""envision"", but of course they never take responsibility for the failure, layoff people they hired, who they motivated by telling them they're ""family"", and cut them off like the ""cost"" they are.

Apple opens the App Store to retro game emulators,2024-04-05T21:41:58+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps,"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.  Apple is loosening its App Store restrictions and opening the marketplace up to retro game emulators. In an update on Friday, Apple announced that game emulators can come to the App Store globally and offer downloadable games. Apple says those games must comply with “all applicable laws,” though — an indication it will ban apps that provide pirated titles. The move should allow the retro console emulators already on Android — at least those that are left — to bring their apps to the iPhone. Game emulators have long been banned from iOS, leaving iPhone owners in search of workarounds via jailbreaking or other workarounds. They’re also one of the key reasons, so far, that iPhone owners in the European Union might check out third-party app stores now that they’re allowed in the region. Apple’s change today could head that off. Alongside the new rules on emulators, Apple also updated its rules around super apps, such as WeChat. It now says that mini-games and mini-apps within these apps must use HTML5, clarifying that they can’t be native apps and games. The change seems to come in response to the antitrust lawsuit filed by the United States, which accuses Apple of attempting to stomp out both cloud game streaming apps and super apps. Apple recently started letting cloud streaming services, like Xbox Cloud Gaming and GeForce Now, onto the App Store. Outside the US, Apple seems to be responding to pressure from the European Commission. In another rule update today, the company said it will now allow music streaming apps in the European Union to include in-app links that point users toward outside purchases and mention pricing information. It will also allow developers to “invite users to provide their email address for the express purpose of sending them a link to the developer’s website to purchase digital music content or services.” After the Commission called Apple’s anti-steering rules “illegal,” Spotify attempted to update its app with links to its website to purchase subscriptions, but it didn’t receive approval from Apple for weeks. Spotify still isn’t happy with Apple’s most recent change, however, as Apple is still planning to charge a commission on purchases made through outside links despite EU Commissioner Margrethe Vestager saying Apple must allow music streaming apps to communicate “freely” with users. “Following the law is not optional, but Apple continues to defy that decision,” Spotify spokesperson Jeanne Moran tells The Verge. “Effective April 6th, the Commission can start noncompliance proceedings and impose daily fines. It’s time for decisive action to once and for all give consumers real choice.”  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

iPhone 12 Problems: 5 Things You Need to Know,2024-04-05T21:14:01+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/iphone-12-problems-5-things-you-need-to-know/,"Published on By Problems are plaguing iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max users. iPhone 12 users are complaining about a wide variety of issues ranging from minor bugs to serious performance issues. And while some of these issues will likely be resolved by Apple in future iOS 17 updates, more problems will popup as people put more wear and tear on their devices. In the guide below, you can learn about the current state of iPhone 12 issues, potential fixes for these problems, places to find feedback, and what’s next from Apple in terms of iOS 17 updates. Table of Contents If you’re having issues activating your phone, check Apple’s System Status page. If you don’t see a green symbol next to iOS Device Activation, you’ll want to wait until it’s green and then try activating the phone again. If it’s green and the process still isn’t working, make sure you have a SIM card inserted in your iPhone. If you’re receiving a “No Sim” or “Invalid SIM” error, you’ll want to head to this guide for assistance. We’re also hearing about the following issues: Owners of the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12, both of which employ a design with aluminum edges, are reportedly seeing discoloration on the chassis. On top of that, iPhone 12 users are complaining about 5G/LTE issues. Some users are saying cellular service is dropping unexpectedly while on-the-go. If you’re thinking about buying an iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro, or an iPhone 12 Pro Max, or if you already own one, you’ll want to monitor feedback from those who have adopted these devices. This feedback will alert you to potential issues with the hardware and software. We recommend keeping an eye on YouTube, Apple’s discussion forums, social media sites like Twitter, and sites like the MacRumors forums for ongoing feedback about the phones. If you’re thinking about moving to Apple’s iOS 17 firmware, or if you’ve already made the move, take a look at our guide that covers the latest version of the software. We’ve also released a quick review that covers the performance of the most up-to-date version of iOS 17, iOS 17.4.1. If you run into a problem, there’s no need to panic. There’s a good chance you’ll be able to avoid taking your new device into an Apple Store or your local carrier store for assistance. First, take a look at our list of fixes for the most common iPhone 12 problems. It will take you through fixes for common issues like broken Bluetooth and busted Wi-Fi. We’ve also released some tips to help you improve performance and a guide that could help you improve your phone’s battery life if you start noticing abnormal drain.

If you can’t find anything there, it’s time to get in touch with Apple. You can get in contact with Apple Support via the company’s website.

The iPad Pro is Apple’s most powerful tablet and that makes it a solid choice for those who want top-of-the-line performance. Here are the key iPad Pro specs buyers should know:  These features position the iPad Pro as a powerful tool for professionals and creatives who require top-tier performance and versatility in their workflow. When comparing the iPad Pro with its predecessors, and other models like the iPad Air and iPad mini, it’s essential to focus on the core differences. Here’s how the iPad Pro stacks up versus the iPad Air. Below is a detailed comparison that highlights the key specifications and differences among these models: The transition from the A12X Bionic chip in the 2018 iPad Pro to the M2 chip in the latest iPad Pro (2022) marked a significant leap in performance, with a 15% increase in speed and a 35% boost in graphics capabilities. The upgrade in the camera system, including support for 4K ProRes video recording, sets the iPad Pro apart from the iPad (10th generation) and its predecessors, offering superior photography and videography. In comparison, the iPad Air (5th generation) and iPad mini (6th generation) offer a balance of performance and portability. The iPad Air comes with the M1 chip, aligning it closer to the iPad Pro in terms of processing power, while the iPad mini’s A15 Bionic chip offers robust performance in a more compact form. The iPad (10th generation), with its A14 Bionic chip, stands as a solid middle ground option, offering a blend of efficiency and capability suitable for a wide range of users.  This underscores the iPad Pro’s position as the most advanced option within Apple’s lineup, catering to users who require the utmost in performance, display quality, and camera capabilities. However, the iPad Air and iPad mini present compelling alternatives for those seeking a balance between functionality and portability, with the iPad (10th generation) serving as an accessible entry point for general use. When considering the iPad Pro against Windows laptops, several factors come into play, especially for those weighing their options for a primary work device.  Here’s what you should consider when comparing the iPad Pro versus a laptop: Understanding these distinctions is crucial for making an informed decision...",2

‘Sugar’ Star Colin Farrell Says Apple TV+’s P.I. Isn’t Your Typical Tough Guy | Video,2024-04-05T19:24:14+00:00,https://www.thewrap.com/colin-farrell-sugar-apple-tv-detective-series-interview/,"“It’s kind of counter to a lot of the more archetypical private detectives that I’ve experienced in the world of noir,” the actor tells TheWrap Colin Farrell plays the title character John Sugar in the Mark Protosevich-scripted series, “Sugar,” which is a love letter to Los Angeles, Hollywood, classic films like “The Big Sleep” and the detective genre itself.  As Farrell told TheWrap in a recent interview, Sugar is not the “archetypical private detective.” Sure, he’s handy with his fists and can easily disarm an assailant, but he is also able to put the most reluctant witness at ease. The character is also a polyglot, a fancy word that means he speaks several different languages fluently — including Japanese, Arabic and Spanish.  The introspective P.I. who’s been hired to find Olivia Siegel, the missing granddaughter of James Cromwell’s legendary Hollywood producer, attracts the usual sorts of trouble throughout the case. But he also draws people to him, from Amy Ryan’s reclusive rock star Melanie Mackintosh to a dog that becomes his sidekick after a chance meeting near Hollywood Blvd. “He’s deeply intuitive… very attuned to his environment, very attuned to anything living in creation; truly trees, birds, humans, dogs,” Farrell said. “That was one of the lovely things about him. He had a tenderness to him as well, and a concern for all things [in] creation.” While fictional detectives like Philip Marlowe, Sam Spade and Mike Hammer aren’t known for being particularly tender, the actor welcomed the unique spin on the genre.  “It’s just kind of counter to a lot of the more archetypical private detectives that I’ve experienced in the world of noir, who are understandably somewhat jaded by what they’ve observed, somewhat tired by taking on the burden of the cases that they’ve worked. And this guy didn’t seem to — although he’s worked cases for years — he didn’t seem to carry that kind of weight with him. He had this optimism and this curiosity,” Farrell explained. The Irish actor, who has an American accent in the series, also narrates in traditional noir style. “So many of the tropes are honored in this,” he said. “Obviously, the voiceover was an opportunity, as narration voiceovers so often are, to get beneath the hood of the character a little bit more.” Farrell added, “[Sugar] keeps his cards close to his chest, he doesn’t really divulge much about his background or about his history. So it gave us an opportunity to expose more of the character in a way that felt very immediate and very intimate.” In the first episode, Sugar tells us, “Out here, I’m considered a good guy.” But how does Farrell see the character?  “I see him as a good guy,” Farrell agreed, although he admitted that Sugar “gets into the weeds” and more than a little obsessed in trying to find Olivia. “I see him as someone who’s striving for good, and I see him as someone who wants to be on the right side of the lines of history, you know?” The first two episodes of “Sugar” are now s...",0
"There Is A Wristband That Gives Your Apple Watch A Camera, But It's Not Perfect",2024-04-05T19:15:21+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1551524/apple-watch-camera-wrist-band-wristcam-photos-video-not-perfect/,"We may receive a commission on purchases made from links. 
The Apple Watch has come a long way since it was originally introduced back in 2015. What started out as a peripheral with limited functionality that was almost entirely dependent on a paired iPhone has become quite the feature-rich device in its own right. These days, there are a bunch of ways to customize the Apple Watch experience to a user's personal preferences, and the wrist-bound device is capable of performing many of the tasks that larger devices like an iPhone or an iPad are typically used for. However, that's not to say it can just do absolutely everything.





While it's possible to view photos on an Apple Watch, none of the current variations of the unit possess any sort of camera functionality. As such, users still have to keep their connected Apple device close if they want to be able to take pictures unless they're willing to take the plunge on a certain eye-catching peripheral. Indeed, one particular third-party company has risen to the task of equipping the Apple Watch with its very own camera by way of a special accessory — and it can get the job done quite effectively, save for a few issues.

For those seeking a solution to add camera functionality to their Apple Watch, one option on the market is the Wristcam.

The Wristcam itself is composed of a large band that contains a multi-facing camera core. This band can be attached to the Apple Watch like any other standard compatible wristband. It can connect seamlessly to WatchOS by downloading the official Wristcam app for Apple Watch or for iPhone. Once everything is set up, the app allows the user to quick...",1
How Vision Pro tech could come to the Mac,2024-04-05T19:12:01+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-vision-pro-tech-could-come-to-the-mac/,"You’re probably familiar with the Apple Vision Pro, which uses spatial computing technology to bring content alive in the world around you. Virtual reality headsets and 3D displays exist to make games and other content feel more immersive. Apple, however, wants to be the best of the best and is looking into bringing spatial computing experiences to computer monitors, presumably to run your Mac. A patent for “Displays with Selective Pixel Brightness tuning” was published on April 4, showing the company’s interest in the technology. Much of it involves using a lenticular display and a lenticular lens film so that a viewer can see what looks like three-dimensional images without wearing a headset. The images can be displayed in controllable zones, and the pixel values of each pixel are adjustable for better quality. Multiple people can also view the same image, hinting that the display could have more than one viewing angle. “A plurality of the lenticular lenses may extend across the length of the display. The lenticular lenses may be configured to enable stereoscopic viewing of the display such that a viewer perceives three-dimensional images,” explains Apple in the patent. Apple doesn’t mention any of its products in the patent, but that is a common practice with many companies. Apple is protecting the idea of the technology, and just because Apple has patented something, it doesn’t always become a final product. It’s still cool to read about the concept, though, and dream of a future Apple Studio Display with this technology — or even a MacBook display that can display 3D content. We’ve already seen companies play with the idea of 3D displays. 3D televisions (that required glasses) were once the rage, but the technology fell by the wayside. 3D is in the middle of making a comeback, though, such as the upcoming Samsung monitor, a glasses-free 3D monitor featuring similar spatial technology to what Apple is playing with in this patent. Such a technology is expensive, though, as Apple Vision Pro is $3,500, and we can’t imagine what a 3D monitor from Apple might cost. The Apple Studio Display already costs $1,600, and the Pro Display XDR $5,000. The MacBook Air has officially caught up. Now with the M3 on board, the MacBook Air has gained the benefits of the new chip, which was previously available just on the MacBook Pro and iMac. Choosing between the M3 15-inch MacBook Air and the 14-inch MacBook Pro is tough, and requires an in-depth look at differences in ports, displays, speakers, and more. It's a legitimately hard decision to make. A new study on virtual reality comfort suggests that some of the best VR headsets have a feature that can help prevent motion sickness. Also known as simulator sickness, the problem is due to a mismatch between what you see in a head-mounted display (HMD) and what your body feels in reality. It’s well known that gamers prefer higher frames per second (fps) to be able to react more quickly and aim with greater accurac...",2

"Tim Cook Under Pressure Amid Scrapped Apple Car Project, iPhone’s Fading Appeal",2024-04-05T18:56:28+00:00,https://observer.com/2024/04/apple-layoff-tim-cook-iphone-china/,"Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook has come under pressure as the tech giant has made its first round of layoffs since the Covid-19 pandemic following the abandonment of several ambitious projects and falling iPhone sales in China, its largest overseas market. Apple will cut 614 workers across eight different facilities in Santa Clara, Calif., near the company’s Cupertino headquarters, effective May 27, according to a state filing this week.

The layoffs were likely related to Apple’s recent shuttering of its Special Projects Group, a secretive initiative launched a decade ago whose projects include the development of a fully autonomous, electric car. Apple also recently scuppered a project to build next-generation Apple Watch screens utilizing microLED technology at the end of last month, Bloomberg reported, as the undertaking proved too costly and complex. Though small compared to the 161,000 full-time workers Apple employed at the end of the company’s last fiscal year, the recent layoffs are particularly significant given that the iPhone maker has until now avoided making cuts even as its Big Tech peers slashed tens of thousands of jobs in the first quarter of 2024, according to a report by job market consulting group Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The company is also facing serious headwinds in China, as iPhone sales have plunged in the country by 24 percent over the first six weeks of the year, according to Counterpoint Research. Last week, just after an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice accused Apple of monopolizing smartphone markets, Cook visited Shanghai on a charm offensive as his company grapples with increasing geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing and stiffening competition from homegrown rivals, particularly Huawei. Current obstacles aside, Counterpoint predicts that Apple’s annual revenue will cross the $100 billion mark for the first time in 2025 as the company is expected to reveal its highly anticipated artificial intelligence strategy at a developers’ conference on June 10 and more emerging markets embrace the iPhone, likely offsetting falling sales in China. Also this week, Cook sold 200,000 shares of Apple stock, worth $32 million, according to SEC filings. The sale netted Cook about $16 million. Apple shares have slid 8.6 percent in 2024 so far, slashing the company’s value by more than $200 billion. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

When Will Apple Release watchOS 10.5?,2024-04-05T18:37:37+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/when-will-apple-release-watchos-10-5/,"Published on By Apple’s confirmed a new watchOS 10.5 update for Apple Watch. The software doesn’t have an official release date, but we can help Apple Watch users set proper expectations.  watchOS 10.5 is a milestone upgrade, the fifth such update for watchOS 10. The first beta doesn’t have much on board, but at the very least it should bring bug fixes and security patches to compatible Watch models. Apple hasn’t confirmed the watchOS 10.5 release date and there’s a good chance it doesn’t offer one ahead of the official roll out. Apple rarely confirms specific dates for milestone upgrades. Fortunately, Apple sticks to predictable release patterns when it comes to milestone firmware and that means we can provide you with a look at a potential release window for watchOS 10.5. The firmware will likely stay in testing throughout the month of April. The final release should come in May. Here’s why.  If we take a look back at Apple’s history, milestone watchOS updates have traditionally arrived in May. Last year, Apple pushed watchOS 9.5 to Apple Watch users on May 18th. The year before that, watchOS 8.6 was pushed on May 16th. If we go back even further, watchOS 7.5 arrived on May 24th. You can probably see the pattern. While not confirmed, we should see Apple use similar timing for the watchOS 10.5 release date. Also of note, we’ve heard Apple’s new iPad Pro and new iPad Air will arrive in May so we should see new software land in and around their release date. Once Apple pushes watchOS 10.5 to Apple Watch, look for the company to put a new watchOS 10.6 update into beta testing alongside new software for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

Roku learns sneaky way to show TV ads – and we hate the idea,2024-04-05T18:25:56+00:00,https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/roku-learns-sneaky-way-to-show-tv-ads-and-we-hate-the-idea-4514809,"Trusted Reviews is supported by its audience. If you purchase through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more. If you’re an owner of a Roku branded TV set, you mightn’t be safe from invasive ads, even if you use third-party set-top box like an Apple TV or a Fire TV Stick or hook-up a games console. The company has patented a way to serve advertisements to viewers when they press pause on content running from third-party devices hooked-up to a Roku telly.  Mario Kart 8 drops to all-time Amazon low Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a must-own Switch classic and Amazon is selling the game for best price yet at £32.95
 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a must-own Switch classic and Amazon is selling the game for best price yet at £32.95 So, if you got up for a mid-movie piddle and hit pause on Dune or your latest Forza marathon, the chances are, Roku would have invaded your set-top box via the HDMI input and shoved one of its own ads in your face. Roku already does this via its own interface, but the third-party roll out wouldn’t be well received. Now those buying Roku tellies generally use the RokuOS to stream content, because the tellies themselves are generally budget-friendly sets designed with the built-in smart OS in mind. However, gamers would likely be hit hardest by the move. The technology has been patented (via Lowpass) by Roku – which probably means it isn’t imminently about to be integrated – and describes a system for “for ad insertion by a display device coupled to a media device via a high-definition media interface (HDMI) connection.” It would be achieved by noticing the pause button had been hit and reporting that back to the television and, in all likelihood, dropping the ad in as a sort of screensaver. The TV could also analyse whether the frames being displayed on the TV haven’t changed and realise the set has been paused that way. The company is also talking about detecting the on-screen content in order show you ads that may be related to what you’re watching, according to the patent.  Whether this would be tolerated by the other set-top box or console makers, who could quite easily do the same to viewers/gamers if they chose, remains to be seen. After all, this effectively hijacks the experience. Ads are a big money maker for Roku right now, but this is a wholly unpalatable proposition for anyone who spends their hard earned on a Roku TV. 
                                                                                    Chris Smith is a freelance technology journalist for a host of UK tech publications, including Trusted Reviews. He's based in South Florida, USA.

Bragg to officially ask for extradition of suspect accused of murdering NYC mom in hotel as spat with Ariz. rages on,2024-04-05T18:11:24+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/04/05/us-news/bragg-to-officially-ask-for-extradition-of-suspect-accused-of-murdering-nyc-mom-in-hotel-as-spat-with-ariz-rages-on/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Manhattan prosecutors said Friday they’ll officially request the extradition of the career criminal charged in the slaying of a Queens mom at a Soho hotel — as a two-month standoff with Arizona authorities who have refused to send him back to the Big Apple rages on. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced the indictment of Raad Almansoori, 26, on murder and robbery charges for the Feb. 7 beating and strangling of 38-year-old Denisse Oleas-Arancibia in a room at the Soho 54 Hotel. With the indictment, Bragg’s office said it will move to formally request that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul issues a warrant for Almansoori’s extradition back to Manhattan from Maricopa County in Arizona. Bragg said in a statement that his office was one step closer to bringing justice for Oleas-Arancibia, who was found dead by a hotel maid with a bloody iron lying next to her head, according to police sources. “Our professional, dedicated prosecutors and investigators will continue to build the strongest possible case, and we will be prepared to prosecute Raad Almansoori for these horrific allegations when he is returned to New York,” Bragg said in a statement.  “My heart is with the family and loved ones of Ms. Oleas-Arancibia during this difficult time as they continue to mourn their loss, as well as the victims of Almansoori’s alleged crimes in Maricopa County.” The DA’s office expects the warrant will act as a detainer based on their analysis of New York and Arizona laws. Almansoori will remain in custody until he returns to New York to face murder charges once his Arizona cases wrap up, regardless of the outcome. Almansoori has been locked up on attempted murder, assault and kidnapping charges in Arizona after he was arrested in Scottsdale on Feb. 18 for allegedly carjacking one woman and attacking another at a local McDonald’s. His arrest came about 10 days after he allegedly beat and strangled Oleas-Arancibia — and was caught on surveillance footage leaving the hotel while wearing the victim’s pink tights, authorities said. Bragg was embroiled in a political dogfight with Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell after she said she didn’t trust the Democratic DA to keep Almansoori locked up if he were sent back to New York to face charges in Oleas-Arancibia’s murder. Mitchell later said she would consider extracting the Almansoori only after her office finished prosecuting his pending cases in Arizona — but Bragg had been seeking to bring him back to Manhattan to face the more serious charge of murder. The DA then punched back at Mitchell, accusing the Republican of “simple old-fashioned grandstanding and politics.” “It is deeply disturbing to me that a member of my profession, a member of law enforcement, would choose to play political games in a murder case,” Bragg said at a Feb. 22 press conference. “The conversation should be about victims, victims’ families: that’s what we do in Manhattan.”...",0
How to Fix Most AirTag Problems,2024-04-05T18:09:47+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/how-to-fix-airtag-problems/,"Published on By If you recently ran into problems with an AirTag, we want to help you fix said issue. These troubleshooting tips should alleviate the issue and help you avoid a visit with Apple support.  The most common AirTag issues are connection issues and battery problems. We’ve heard about others, but these are the ones we see and hear about the most. If you’re experiencing one of these problems, or another issue with your AirTag, try one of the fixes below. First, make sure your iPhone is up to date with the latest iOS software. This will also help keep the AirTag updated with Apple’s latest software. You can find the newest version of iOS for your device in the Settings app. Tap General, then tap Software Update. If software is available, follow the prompts. Apple periodically releases new software for the AirTag and the accessory depends on your iPhone to update. Make sure your AirTag(s) is in Bluetooth range of your iPhone. This is how software updates are delivered to AirTags. There is no way to manually install an update. In order to make sure your AirTags are running the latest software, you need to perform a quick check on your iPhone: The latest firmware is 2.0.73. If the latest software doesn’t have any effect, you should try resetting the AirTag. This will typically resolve most issues with the device.  To reset an AirTag: Now, check and see if the issues have dissipated. If not, move onto the following steps. An AirTag relies on your Apple ID/iCloud account to sync. If something is amiss with your Apple ID, it won’t work properly. If you’re having trouble, check and make sure you’re properly logged into the Apple account you use on your iPhone. If not, sign back in. You can also try logging in and out of your account and see if that resolves the issue you’re experiencing. You use the Find My app to locate your AirTags. Make sure Find My is enabled on your iPhone and any other Apple device you’re trying to view your AirTags on. If you run into an issue while trying to setup a new AirTag, it may be related to device security. You will need to ensure your iCloud account has two-factor authentication toggled on. Here’s how to ensure two-factor authentication is toggled on on an iPhone: On this screen, ensure two-factor authentication is on. If none of those solutions work, try resetting all of the settings on your iPhone. This doesn’t delete any data, it simply restores your iPhone’s settings to their defaults. You can also try replacing the AirTag’s battery.  If you don’t have a replacement lying around, they are available at retailers like Amazon. Once you’ve acquired a replacement CR2032 battery, manually swap out the old battery for the new one. Here’s how you do that: In a lot of cases, a battery swap will resolve issues with the AirTag.

With updates rolling out regularly, Gemini is Google’s answer to OpenAI ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, whatever it is that Apple is working on, and all the other generative AI tools now pushing for our attention. If you’re wondering how to get started with Gemini or what it can do for you, these tips should help. You can access Gemini for free on the web as an extension of your Google account, with a more powerful Advanced tool available for $19.99 a month (with cloud storage and a few other goodies thrown in as well). Every time you give Google Gemini a prompt, you get a series of drafts back in return, though only one is shown straight away—you can click the Show Drafts button up in the top right corner to click through the other answer variations the AI has produced. Based on our testing, the alternative drafts may not be hugely different from the original, depending on what your prompt was and how many ways there are to answer it. You can also get Gemini to think again with the regenerate button (the reload sign) on the far right. You don’t have to accept Gemini’s first answer. Also, you can ask it to regenerate a new response from scratch (by clicking Show Drafts and then the reload button on the far right). You can also click the modify response button (the three sliders) under each answer. The button leads to a new menu, where your options are Shorter, Longer, Simpler, More casual, and More professional. If those options don’t cover the modifications you want to make, you can always ask for changes (like “make it funnier” with your next prompt. You don’t have to type out everything you’d like to say to Gemini—you can easily paste in text from the clipboard and other programs. You can then have that text rewritten in a new style, summarized to a certain length, or analyzed in whatever way you require. When it comes to getting text out of Gemini, the simplest method is the Copy option, which you’ll find behind the three dots at the end of every answer. You can then paste Gemini’s response into a web form, a document, an email, an instant message, or whatever you like. At the time we’re writing this, Gemini’s image creation capabilities have been put on pause. Presumably, they’ll come back at some point, but in the meantime, you can still upload your own pictures through the Gemini web interface and analyze them. This works best for finding out what’s in a picture or summarizing something, but you can ask anything you want—you can even request tips on how an image can be improved. Think of it as an upgraded version of what Google Lens can do with images. Gemini makes it easy to share your conversations with others, though you need to be cautious about sharing anything with personal or sensitive information. There’s a share and export button under each reply, which looks like a less-than sign. From the menu that pops up, ...",0
New iPad Air Price: What to Expect,2024-04-05T17:29:56+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/new-ipad-air-price-what-to-expect/,"Published on By A new iPad Air is imminent which means we’ve been getting questions about the device’s possible price point. If you’re interested in the iPad Air 6, here’s what you need to know while we wait for Apple’s announcement.  Nothing is confirmed, but rumors suggest a new iPad Air is coming in early May after a bit of a delay. The new iPad Air will reportedly offer performance upgrades and, perhaps, a larger display size for those that want more real estate without having to shell out for an iPad Pro. If Apple does launch multiple sizes, you can expect multiple price points. Exactly how much the device will cost remains in the shadows, but we can give you an early look based on current pricing. While we wait for a definitive answer, here’s everything we know right now about the iPad Air 6 price point. Keep this information in mind as we close in on an announcement. The current iPad Air, the fifth-generation model from 2022, starts at $599. It only comes in one size, 10.9-inches, but prices go up as you add storage or tack on cellular data. Here’s the full breakdown of the iPad Air 5’s price: Apple’s maintained these prices since the iPad Air 5 launched back in March of 2022. However, we’ve seen retailers like Amazon drop the price in 2024. We should see further price cuts once the new models arrive. Rumors suggest Apple will increase the price point of the new OLED iPad Pro models. The 2024 iPad Pro’s should arrive alongside the new iPad Air. Unfortunately, we haven’t seen rumors about the new iPad Air price which makes it a mystery as we approach Apple’s announcement.  While this may be a bit unsettling, especially for those on a tight budget, it may be a sign that we won’t see significant movement in price. If there are two different sizes like rumors suggest, you can expect the larger iPad Air 6 to cost more than the smaller model. So what does that mean? Assuming Apple keeps the price of the smaller 10.9-inch model the same, the iPad Air 6 will start at $599. If there’s a model larger screen, we may see the company charge $200-300 more for the increased size which would put the price of the 12.9-inch iPad Air 6 at $799 or $899. How did we arrive at this price? There’s a $300 price difference between the 11-inch iPad Pro and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The base 11-inch iPad Pro is $799 and the base 12.9-inch iPad Pro is $1099. There are technical differences between the iPad Pro’s Liquid Retina displays. If there are quality differences between the iPad Air 6’s displays, we could see a similar gap in pricing. If the only difference is the size, we may not see the price jump as much. This is, of course, a prediction on our part, but we wouldn’t anything more than a $300 price difference between the two models. You can expect Apple, carriers, and retailers to offer price cuts at launch though these will be limited to trade-in offers.  A trade-in requires you to exchange a device, like an older iPad Air, for money back on the purchase of a new d...",1
"watchOS 10.5, watchOS 10.6 & watchOS 11: What’s Next for Watch",2024-04-05T17:11:05+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/watchos-10-watchos-11-apple-watch/,"Published on By With a new watchOS 10 update in beta testing and rumors about watchOS 10’s successor swirling, we felt it would be helpful to put together a watchOS release timeline for Apple Watch users. Since watchOS 10’s release back in September, Apple’s pushed numerous upgrades to the operating system and owners of compatible Apple Watch models. The most recent upgrade, watchOS 10.4, is a milestone upgrade for the operating system. It brought new features, fixes, and patches to Apple Watch 4 and others. Apple isn’t stopping there. We’ll see a lot more watchOS software roll out in 2024. Apple Watch users can expect a mix of point updates (watchOS x.x.x) and milestone (watchOS x.x) firmware.  Thanks to leaks, Apple’s beta program, and many years of experience covering software, we have a pretty good read on what you can expect on the watchOS 10 front. We’ve also a bit about watchOS 10’s successor, presumably called watchOS 11. So, if you’ve been curious about what’s in Apple’s pipeline for your Watch model, here’s a quick look at what’s coming next for the device. Table of Contents This guide will take you through known features, release dates, and betas. It will also lead you through the unknown so you can set proper expectations. Apple’s put a new watchOS 10.5 update into beta testing. Developers and those enrolled in the Beta Software Program can test it out right now.  The company hasn’t confirmed the software’s release date, but we expect it to get deployed to compatible Apple Watch models in May. If history repeats itself, and with Apple it typically does, we should see watchOS 10.6 land in beta testing shortly after watchOS 10.5’s release. We expect watchOS 10.6 to stay in beta testing for several weeks before Apple pushes it to Watch users alongside iOS 17.6 for iPhone in July. We may also see Apple release watchOS 10.7 though that release is murkier. The company didn’t release a watchOS 9.7 update last year though it did push watchOS 8.7 in 2022. We may also see point upgrades arrive in between these milestone upgrades for watchOS 10. Apple’s working on the next version of watchOS, dubbed watchOS 11.  We’ve released a guide that covers everything there is to know right now about the Apple’s Watch’s next operating system, but here are the highlights: That third piece is important in the context of this guide. The Apple Watch 4 is the device that will reportedly miss watchOS 10 and remain stuck on watchOS 10. If this is true, we expect Apple to continue to support the device with new versions of watchOS 10. These updates will probably be sporadic, but they will deliver important security updates.

NYC officials ripped for sending earthquake emergency alerts nearly 25 minutes after the fact,2024-04-05T17:06:04+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/04/05/us-news/nyc-officials-ripped-for-sending-earthquake-emergency-alerts-nearly-25-minutes-later/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 New York City officials were ripped Friday on social media when it took nearly 25 minutes for an emergency alert to go out after the earthquake struck — and residents then suffered through overkill warnings for nearly two hours. The 4.8-magnitude quake struck near Lebanon, New Jersey, around 10:23 a.m. and was promptly felt across the tri-state area, according to the US Geological Survey, which confirmed at 10:34 a.m. that it happened. But New York City didn’t issue an emergency Notify NYC phone alert about the tremor until 10:47 a.m. The city then also issued a WE Alert, or Wireless Emergency message, to phones at 11 a.m. and 11:45 a.m., while the state’s WE Alert went out at 12:05 p.m. — messages that popped up at various times on people’s phones. Phil Calçado wrote on X that his mother in Brazil called him before the first local emergency alert was sent out. Zachary Iscol, head of the city’s Office of Emergency Management, told reporters at a press conference afterward Friday that the Adams administration needed to confirm the quake before alerting residents. “We also need to make sure we’re putting out the proper guidance. The 20 minutes is very, very fast for a public notification,” Iscol said. The city’s first notification — which was sent 13 minutes after the quake was confirmed — said the earthquake had already occurred in the New York City area and advised residents to “remain indoors and to call 911 if injured.” The second alert noted that “aftershocks may be felt” but “New Yorkers can continue usual activities.” The state Office of Emergency Management said in an email to The Post, “The purpose of the alert was to warn about aftershocks.  “Aftershocks can last for a week. We were not sending it to alert about the existence of the earthquake, as information about that was already widely reported and shared across social media.” Critics were swift. “I am concerned with the delay we experienced with the emergency alert system, with many reports saying that on some phones, including mine, New Yorkers did not receive emergency text for over an hour after the earthquake. This is unacceptable,” Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said in a statement.  “New Yorkers deserve a system that provides them with critical information when they need it most. This earthquake didn’t cause major damage, but if this delay had happened during a more severe incident, the consequences could have been significant.”Vish Burra wrote on X, “NYC sending out an emergency alert about the earthquake 30 minutes after the earthquake is peak NYC Adams administration.” Another X user also mused, “getting an earthquake emergency alert a full 30+ mins after it happened is the best example of NY government.” Brooklynite Clarence Patton wrote: “Look Miss Emergency Alert System, if this had been a bad earthquake, we would’ve all been dead and/or buried f...",0

2024 iPad Pro Price: What the Rumors Say Right Now,2024-04-05T16:42:03+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/2024-ipad-pro-price-what-we-know-so-far/,"Published on By If you’re planning to buy Apple’s new iPad Pro, you may need to spend quite a bit of money. Exactly how much is currently up for debate as we wait for the company to make an announcement.  All signs point to a 2024 iPad Pro launch in the near future. Reports suggests we’ll see an announcement take place in early May after a bit of a delay. There’s a lot to be excited about if you’re in the market for a new tablet. The new iPad Pro reportedly has big time upgrades on board including, for the first time, an OLED display. Of course, these upgrades may come with at an added cost to consumers. How much? We can’t say for certain given Apple’s continued silence, but we should get our answer soon. While we wait, here’s everything we know right now about the iPad Pro’s price point. Keep this information in mind as we get closer to the device’s arrival. Right now, the 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ starts at $799 while the 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ starts at $1099. Here’s the current breakdown of the iPad Pro’s pricing. Apple has kept these prices in place since it launched the 2022 iPad Pro’s back in October, 2022. That being said, we’ve seen retailers like Amazon drop the price in 2024. If you’re currently on a budget, you may not want to wait for Apple’s latest high-end tablet. According to multiple reports, the 2024 model could cost more, perhaps a lot more, than its predecessors thanks to the new OLED panels and other upgrades. We don’t know how much of a jump we’ll see, but here’s what rumors are saying. Apple’s reportedly considering its pricing strategy and the company might start the 11-inch model at $1,500 and the 13-inch iPad Pro at $1,800. This information comes from the aggregator account yeux1122 on Naver who has been hit-or-miss in the past. This feels like way too big of a jump from the iPad Pro’s current pricing and other pricing rumors have suggested a far more modest increase.  Taiwanese publication Digitimes says that while we’ll see a price increase, it may be lower than other estimates. The site believes we could see the price increase up to $160. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the OLED iPad Pro could see a price increase, but he didn’t attach any specific numbers to the claim. According to Aju Korea Daily, by way of TrendForce, Apple is apparently reducing orders for the new iPad Pro by as much as 30%. TrendForce believes this could be due in part to the iPad Pro’s expected price increase, a move that could potentially stunt demand for the tablet. While this change could price some consumers out, we do expect Apple and its partners to offer substantial trade-in offers during the pre-order period and post-launch. Trade-in deals can help consumers knock quite a bit of money off the price point of a new product and should help to mitigate some of the 2024 iPad Pro’s price. To get a feel for Apple’s trade-in offers, you can check Apple’s current trade-in values on its website. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are m...",-1
Apple lays off 600 workers in California after shuttering self-driving car project,2024-04-05T16:36:41+00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/05/apple-layoffs-california-self-driving-cars,"Tech company cuts employees from eight offices in Santa Clara in its first big wave of post-pandemic job cuts Apple is laying off more than 600 workers in California, marking the company’s first big wave of post-pandemic job cuts amid a broader wave of tech industry consolidation. The iPhone maker notified 614 workers in multiple offices on 28 March that they were losing their jobs, with the layoffs becoming effective on 27 May, according to reports to regional authorities. The workers were cut from eight offices in Santa Clara, according to the filings under the state’s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, also known as Warn. But it is not clear which departments or projects the employees were involved in. In February, Apple canceled its multibillion-dollar plans to build an electric car. Executives at the time reportedly told employees that the company was pivoting its resources towards artificial intelligence programs, and layoffs were expected for some staff. Apple’s electric vehicle program originally intended to build a fully self-driving car, but continually shifted its plans and failed to produce a viable product amid staff turnover and missed deadlines. The company’s decision to fully shutter the program nevertheless surprised employees, according to Bloomberg. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment early on Friday. The Cupertino, California, company had been a notable exception as other tech companies slashed their workforces over the past two years. There was a big surge in hiring during the Covid-19 pandemic, when people spent more time and money online, and big tech companies are still larger than they were before the pandemic. Still, as growth slows, companies are focusing on cutting costs. In a recent regulatory filing, Apple said it had about 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. Amazon announced earlier this week a fresh round of layoffs, this time at its cloud computing business AWS. In recent months, the video game maker Electronic Arts said it was cutting about 5% of its workforce, Sony said it was axing about 900 jobs in its PlayStation division, Cisco Systems revealed plans to lay off more than 4,000 workers and the social media company Snap, owner of Snapchat, announced it was slashing 10% of its global workforce.",-3
The best iPhone 15 Pro cases in 2024: our 21 favorites,2024-04-05T16:30:38+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/best-apple-iphone-15-pro-cases/,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? The iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are two of the best options to enjoy Apple's smartphone world. These are the top-of-the-line iPhones available, equipped with all the latest features, and – excitingly for anyone who also uses a laptop or iPad – a USB-C port at the bottom. The iPhone 15 Pro is the phone to go for if you want great performance matched with a more manageable 6.1-inch display, and many would argue that it's the perfect combination of size and power. It is important to protect your device from accidental drops and scratches, especially since it is an expensive phone that costs $1,000. Thankfully, you can easily safeguard your investment by using a protective case that can withstand the usual hazards of daily use, such as bumps and scratches. We offer a variety of case options to choose from, including slim cases and rugged cases for maximum protection. Take a look, and you're sure to find something you'll love. The Apple iPhone 15 Pro comes in a number of different, muted colors to match the titanium frame, and it's easy to see why you wouldn't want to hide that. The Speck Presidio Clear means you don't have to. It's completely clear, and has been treated to resist yellowing as it ages, so it'll stay clear and unobtrusive for as long as you need it. ""Clear"" isn't synonymous with ""low protection"" either, as the hybrid construction of TPU and polycarbonate (PC) and Speck's clever design means it's rather well protected, with 13 feet of drop protection. It has a Microban coating for a 99% reduction in stain- and odor-causing bacteria, and the materials the case is made from are 50% recycled. It's generally on the more expensive side, but if you shop around, you can find it for cheaper. If you're not keen on cases, but still want a case to protect against scuffs and scratches, Peel's Super Thin cases should be where you start looking. While these are absolutely not the case of choice for anyone who's worried about bumps, drops, or heavier damage, it's otherwise perfect for anyone who's not usually a fan of cases. Basically a step up from a skin, Peel's Super Thin case is extremely, incredibly thin — to the point of being semitransparent even when it's not a clear case. There's a big range of options though, from clear colors to semi-transparent and matte options too. Incredible slim, sleek, and oh-so minimalist, Peel's cases aren't for those who want big protection, but they're perfect if you want the minimum. Every iPhone has been a hit in the style department, but sometimes you want your phone to have a little more to it — perhaps a cute little hit that sets it apart and makes it unique. That's where LoveCases's options come in. This isn't the most protective option that exists, but we let it off because it looks great. This design is marked as a Caramel Macchiato style, but based on the inclusion of pumpkins, we'd wager there's an argument...",2

How to Connect Your Apple Pencil to an iPad,2024-04-05T16:29:46+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/how-to-connect-your-apple-pencil-to-an-ipad-1851365850,"We have three Apple Pencils  now, and all three pair with your iPad differently. This would have been confusing enough on its own. However, to add to the confusion, in some cases, the same Pencil pairs differently with different generations of the iPad. If none of this makes sense, that’s okay. This guide will help break everything down for you.  There are three Apple Pencils currently available for sale. All three differ in specs, functionality, and how they pair with your iPad. The first-gen Apple Pencil was released in 2015 and is priced at $100. The second-gen Pencil came out in 2021 and retails for $130. In November 2023, we got the USB-C Apple Pencil, which, priced at $79, is the most affordable model yet.  Before you begin pairing, you might want to check that you have the Apple Pencil that works with your iPad. Refer to this Apple Support guide for help.  Remove the cap from the back of the Pencil, and you’ll see a Lightning connector inside. Plug that into the Lightning port on your iPad. A Pair option will appear on your iPad. Tap on it to activate pairing.  That’s all you need to do until you need to re-pair. This can happen when you restart your iPad, turn Airplane Mode on, or pair your Pencil with another iPad. If this happens, you’d need to repeat those steps to re-pair. You’re going to need a dedicated USB-C to Apple Pencil adapter for this one. Remove the cap on the Pencil and plug it into one of the sides of the adapter. Plug a USB-C cable into its other side and the other end of the cable into your iPad.  When you see a Pair button show up on your iPad, tap on it to activate pairing. Once paired successfully, you can unplug your Pencil from the adapter. It will stay connected until you pair it with another iPad or restart your iPad. If you do any of those, follow these steps again.  This one’s probably the simplest. Just place your Pencil where you have the volume controls on your iPad. It’ll automatically attach to a magnetic connector that’s right in the middle on that side. You’ll hear a satisfying click when that happens. A pop-up on your iPad is going to notify you that your Pencil has been paired. You’re ready to pull it back out and start using it.  For this one, make sure your iPad is updated to at least iPadOS 17.1 or later. Slide open the end of the Apple Pencil to reveal the USB-C port inside. Plug a USB-C cable into the port and its other end into your iPad. Your Pencil should be ready to use.

How to Turn Off an iPad,2024-04-05T16:27:53+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/how-to-turn-off-an-ipad-1851387032,"Turning off an iPad looks different for models with and without a home button. Your iPad is going to have a home button if it’s an iPad Pro from 2017 or earlier or an iPad Air, iPad Mini, or a standard iPad from 2019 or earlier. If you’re unsure about which button is which, this Apple Support guide can help. Just as to how to reset to factory settings works on an iPad, turning it off for a bit also helps when you run into issues. In fact, it’s a much easier and quicker way to troubleshoot any issues. It helps refresh your iPad’s RAM or working memory, which optimizes its overall performance. Since it’s probably the most straightforward fix, I’d recommend starting with this one. If you can’t get it to turn off, try force restarting it.   If your iPad has a home button, turning it off is very easy. Interestingly, you won’t need the home button for it. Just press and hold the top button until you see a slider appear on your screen. Drag the slider all the way to the right and wait for a few seconds for your iPad to fully shut down. If your model doesn’t have a home button, you’re going to need a little more than just the top button to turn it off. You’d need to press and hold the top button and any one of the two volume buttons (it doesn’t matter which volume button you press) at the same time. When you see a slider appear on your screen, drag it all the way to the right and give your device a few seconds to turn off. There’s also a way to turn off your iPad in the Settings menu, and this one works regardless of which model you’re using. If it’s easier, you can go into Settings > General > Shut Down and then drag the slider that appears. This is a good option for folks who are confused about whether their iPad sports a home button.

When Will Support for iOS 15 End?,2024-04-05T16:24:15+00:00,https://www.gottabemobile.com/when-will-support-for-ios-15-end/,"Published on By If you own an iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, or iPhone 7 Plus, you might be wondering when software support for your device might end. In this guide, we’ll help you set proper expectations.  Since the release of iOS 17, Apple’s continued to push new iOS 15 software to these models. The releases have been very sporadic and that should continue in the months ahead. iOS 15.8.2 is the latest upgrade for these iPhones, but it probably won’t be the last release. We should see new iOS 15 software roll out in 2024 with the next version most likely coming when Apple releases new milestone software for iOS 17. iOS 17.5 is currently in beta testing and we expect it to arrive in May. That’s when iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 7, and iPhone 7 Plus users should expect their next upgrade. After that, we should see a few more versions of iOS 15, with security patches, move out to these models. But what about after that? We expect iOS 15 to continue to get patched up until iOS 18 is released for the iPhone in the fall. iOS 18 will debut at WWDC 24 in June. After that, we may see support for iOS 15 end.  Apple typically keeps iPhones updated with software releases for seven years or longer. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are both eight years old and they, alongside the original iPhone SE, are the longest supported iPhones. Eventually, they will stop receiving updates and 2024 may be the year it finally ends. Apple hasn’t confirmed and we won’t know for sure until September. If iOS 15 support does continue beyond September, we’d expect releases for these iPhones to become more sporadic than they already are. Since the release of iOS 17 back in September, Apple’s released three versions of iOS 15: iOS 15.8, iOS 15.8.1, and iOS 15.8.2. It’s clear development has slowed to a crawl and it’s only a matter of time before it stops completely. And if it does end this year, owners of iOS 15-powered models should consider an upgrade to a newer model. Your email address will not be published.

Apple Laid Off 600 People in Pivot Away From Cars and Watch Displays: Report,2024-04-05T16:10:00+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/apple-layoffs-pivot-away-from-cars-watch-displays-1851390769,"Apple decided to stop building cars and smartwatch displays in-house so it laid off 600 employees, according to a report from Bloomberg Thursday. The layoffs, which occurred in Feb. and March, affected 87 employees working at a secret Apple facility working on smartwatch screens, and hundreds working on the Apple Car. Apple began to wind down its secret car project two months ago, throwing away roughly a decade’s worth of research and billions of dollars in investments. Around the same time, Apple also shut down its internal effort to develop in-house displays for the Apple Watch, according to Bloomberg. Both projects had massive, secret teams that no longer have positions with Apple. These layoffs were reported in filings to the California Employment Development Department. Apple did not immediately respond to Gizmodo’s request for comment. The death of the Apple Car project is taking hundreds of jobs with it. Known internally as Project Titan, the Apple Car was first leaked in 2014 and generated lots of excitement and speculation for roughly a decade. It was rumored to be fully autonomous, but the project hit countless delays. Former employees working on the Apple Car were even convicted for stealing secrets about the project. As for the smartwatch display, this was a smaller team that was part of Apple’s efforts to design more of its technology in-house. Apple customizes the displays in its products, but they’re based on designs from LG and Samsung. This team aimed to make new watch displays that were supposed to be thinner, more colorful, and brighter. However, this effort was scrapped as well. The remaining employees on these teams were reportedly thrown into Apple’s generative AI effort. The iPhone maker seems to be focusing everything on artificial intelligence at the moment, and pulling resources away from moonshot hardware efforts. In some ways, this makes sense for Apple, as other major players such as Google and Amazon are doing the same. However, Apple has historically differentiated itself by bucking trends and innovating on new technologies that don’t exist yet. The Vision Pro is a modern example of this, but other hardware projects are being scrapped. Apple seems to believe it needs to catch up on generative AI or it will be left behind altogether.",-2

Police Bodycam Video Shows Chaotic Scene After River Stabbing: 'His Guts Are Hanging Out',2024-04-05T15:31:50+00:00,https://www.toofab.com/2024/04/05/apple-river-stabbing-videos-released-trial/,"As Nicolae Miu's murder trial continues in Wisconsin, new footage has been released showing the aftermath of his alleged stabbing spree. The incident went down at Apple River in August 2022, with victims and prosecutors claiming 54-year-old Nicolae Miu pulled a knife on a group during a confrontation on the water, which was captured on video. The defense, meanwhile, says Miu was acting in self-defense after being surrounded and taunted by the ""drunk"" group. Isaac Schuman, 17, was killed, while Ryhley Mattison, A.J. Martin, Dante Carlson and Tony Carlson were all injured. Miu faces one charge of first-degree intentional homicide for Schuman's death, as well as four counts of attempted first-degree intentional homicide for the injured parties; he pleaded not guilty to the charges. On Day 4 of the trial, Thursday, much of the testimony came from first responders who arrived on the scene to find absolute chaos. Footage from Sgt. John Farrell's body camera showed him pulling up as a number of victims ran from the river in tears, one of them claiming they had been punched in the face by the then-unknown assailant. Farrell is told the suspect went up river, before he's seen trudging through the water to get to the victims. Other video from Sgt. Chase Durand shows him putting on gloves while approaching A.J. Martin, who was laying on the riverbank. Martin, who was stabbed in the stomach, previously testified that his ""intestines were in my hands"" after the slashing, adding that he ""100%"" thought he was going to die. A woman who was already at the river at the time of the incident can be seen trying to keep Martin alert as they treated his injuries, telling him repeatedly, ""We're right here with you, A.J. We're here for you. Hold on, A.J."" One of the other victims, meanwhile, tells Durand the suspect had a knife -- before Durand tells another responding officer coming to the scene that A.J.'s ""guts are hanging out."" Other footage shown in court on Thursday included the moment Miu was apprehended while with a group of friends at a different portion of the river. It appears nobody in his party knew what had happened with him and the other group, as they're heard asking what he did as they detained him. Authorities can be heard saying his outfit matches the description of their suspect, before noting the markings they spotted on his hand and telling other officers over their radios that they believed they had the suspect in custody. Eventually, he's told he's being placed under arrest. Miu's ex-wife previously testified that she didn't see all of the confrontation, telling the court she saw someone hitting her then-husband, before seeing some of the aftermath and first responders. One member of Miu's party testified he was the only member in their group to call police, but added the their group continued tubing after the incident. Video of Miu's alleged weapon, a knife, was also shown in court (below) -- after it was discovered on the riverbank. The trial is...",0
The best large tablets of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed,2024-04-05T15:30:25+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-large-tablet/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular 'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean?

The best tablets have traditionally been a large-screened alternative to smartphones. But just as the display sizes of phones continue to grow, tablets have seen their screen size increase as well. This is a welcomed trend for those who do a lot of work on a tablet, including students or those who work remotely and want something thin and lightweight but with a large screen.    Also: The best small tablets you can buy Tablets are considered ""large"" if they are 10-15 inches. The larger the screen size means the larger the working area is, which is especially useful if you're using a tablet as a laptop replacement.

Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 5 and Intel Pro 9 are down to their lowest price to date,2024-04-05T15:26:12+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24120956/microsoft-surface-laptop-5-intel-pro-9-convertible-anker-321-power-strip-deal-sale,"By  Sheena Vasani, a writer covering commerce, e-readers, and tech news. She previously wrote about everything from web development to AI at Inside. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. With Apple’s latest MacBook Air hogging all the attention as of late, it’s easy to forget that there are other laptops that might be better suited for your needs. Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 5 and Surface Pro 9, for example, are perfect for Windows fans, and right now, both are down to an all-time low with a 12th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The Surface Laptop 5 starts at $699.99 ($300 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, while the Surface Pro 9 is available at Amazon and Best Buy for $749.99 ($350 off). If you’re looking for a good Windows laptop for general use, the Surface Laptop 5 is still a worthwhile investment despite its age. The stunning laptop is both powerful and portable, with a thin chassis and a spacious 3:2 display that supports Dolby Vision IQ, which allows it to optimize HDR content for better lighting. And while we wish Microsoft had included a few more ports in addition to its lone USB-C and USB-A offerings, it at least supports Thunderbolt 4, unlike its last-gen predecessor.   If you’re looking for a laptop that can double as a tablet, on the other hand, the Surface Pro 9 may be the better option. The Intel-powered convertible sports a 120Hz screen and several fun color options, along with a built-in kickstand and great hardware, especially if you opt for the optional stylus and detachable keyboard. Keep in mind, however, that Microsoft might launch new consumer versions of the Surface Pro 10 and Surface Laptop 6 during its AI event in late May, though the current lineup is still great if you can’t wait.  Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 5 is a beautiful device with strong performance, a nice 3:2 display, and Thunderbolt 4 support. The convertible Surface Pro 9 offers a sharp screen with a speedy 120Hz refresh rate, great color selection, and enough power for tackling everyday computing tasks. If you’re planning on traveling soon now that the weather is warming up in many parts of the US, you’ll need something portable to juice up your electronics. While there are many charging devices on the market, one of our favorites for travel — the Anker 321 Power Strip — is down to an all-time low of $14.96 ($11 off) at Amazon. Anker’s 20W cube combines a power strip and a five-foot extension cord, which comes in handy when, say, you’re staying in an older hotel with few electrical sockets. Not only does it sport three AC outlets, but it also offers a pair of USB-A ports and a single USB-C port, allowing you to easily charge your laptop, phone, tablet, and a bunch of other gadgets. What’s cool is that it’s also smaller than your typical charging brick, so you can even throw it into a small carry-on bag. This all-in-one 20W power cube boasts three AC outlets, two USB-A ports,...",0
Apple is exploring helping users work seamlessly across devices,2024-04-05T15:08:54+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-is-exploring-helping-users-work-seamlessly-across-devices/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular Apple is one step closer to significantly improving cross-device productivity for consumers and businesses alike, if a recently discovered patent filing is any indication. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) recently published an Apple patent application that describes ""continuity of applications across devices."" The application, which Apple filed in December 2023, describes how someone can open an application on one device and then seamlessly transfer the item they're interacting with to another device, which will recognize the item and open the relevant app. ""For example, if email is being drafted on the external device, the electronic device may launch an email editor showing the draft,"" Apple wrote in its patent application. ""In this way, a user can seamlessly transition from the use of one electronic device to another electronic device."" Also: Apple's macOS Ventura focuses on multi-tasking across devices Apple first showcased moving applications across devices at WWDC 2021, when Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi (who is also named as a co-inventor of the technology) dragged a file from his iPad, through his MacBook, to an iMac, to open it in Final Cut Pro. But this latest patent application appears to take things a step further, allowing devices to intelligently recognize the files that users want to interact with, and share them across products with ease. The move makes sense. Now more than ever, tech users are juggling smartphones, tablets, computers, and even AR/VR devices. Letting users seamlessly transition to the device where the experience would be best could be extremely useful. It would also enable decidedly interesting — and more efficient — use cases. ""The user may power-up a laptop, launch an e-mail application, find the specific e-mail for which a response is needed, and begin to prepare the response,"" Apple wrote. ""It would be helpful if the user could transition from use of one device to another, such as transition from reading an e-mail on one device to drafting a reply on another device, in a seamless and cognitively continuous manner."" Apple devices already offer some cross-device functionality. Users can copy text on their MacBook, for instance, and then paste it to iMessage on their iPhones. They can also share screens from an iPad to an Apple TV. Apple's Continuity concept lets users transfer a lot between devices. As with anything else in Apple's realm, it's impossible to know whether the technology described in the patent application will ever become reality. While it certainly sounds promising, only Apple knows what software features are coming to its hardware. As always, Apple is staying tight-lipped.",2
Apple Watch Series 9 Review: The Best Smartwatch for iPhone Users Gets a New Gesture,2024-04-05T15:06:13+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/apple-watch-series-9-review-1850908847,"You should have an Apple Watch if you use an iPhone. It is the defacto accessory, perfectly tailored to the iPhone user’s needs and, presumably, wants. I say “presumably” because Apple’s idea to add the Double Tap gesture is such a distinctive, niche feature to add to a wearable. And yet, it fulfills such a need. At its Wanderlust event, Apple mentioned using your nose to tap something on the watch screen as an example of a need that had to be met. I immediately recalled the handful of times I’d made the same sporadic decision to use some other part of my body to try to interact with a screen. The Double Tap gesture is an actual solution to a common problem. Unfortunately, I didn’t get much time to double-tap myself before penning this review. The feature only went live with the public beta of watchOS 10.1. But at least now, you can try it out if you buy the Apple Watch Series 9 for $400. Unlike Google’s Pixel devices, often saddled with a “coming soon” caveat for many of its coolest features, you can try this one immediately after dropping all that cash.  Apple's latest smartwatch boasts a new gesture that makes it easier to use one-handed, plus a faster processor with on-device Siri. 
 Apple's latest smartwatch boasts a new gesture that makes it easier to use one-handed, plus a faster processor with on-device Siri. 
 Frankly, not much has changed. The Apple Watch Series 9 is the same square-but-rectangular shape as the Apple Watch Series 7 and 8 and every Apple smartwatch before that. But there is no point in fixing what isn’t broken. Square-ish is the signature motif of the Apple Watch. The only new addition this time is a soft pink-hued chassis, which pairs nicely with a pink watchband. I love that the Apple Watch comes in a 41mm size because it is smaller than the 42mm Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 I wear daily. It’s also smaller than the Pixel Watch. Indeed, this is not an obtrusive wearable, especially for smaller wrists. There is a 45mm size, which I tried on after Apple’s Wanderlust event in September. It was too big for me, but it is an option.  Our review unit came with the pink Sport Loop Band to match. I generally don’t do well with this type of material for sensory and logistical reasons. Mostly, I’m afraid of going near water with the band’s cloth-like nylon. I periodically loosened the band and took off the watch so that I wasn’t constantly feeling the abrasion of the tiny fibers. I prefer the regular silicone Sport Band, so choose your path wisely when filling your cart. And definitely don’t choose the FineWoven if you’re worried about how easily scratched it gets. The leading kicker with this generation’s Apple Watch is that the Series 9 display is the brightest Apple’s ever made. It can go up to 2,000 nits, though you won’t be able to force the full nit capabilities since it still relies on the ambient light sensor to initiate it. It ensures you don’t blast your eyes out (or kill the battery).  Inside, the Apple Watch Series 9 runs on...",2
Apple Vision Pro owners now have more decent controller options,2024-04-05T15:00:55+00:00,https://www.engadget.com/apple-vision-pro-owners-now-have-more-decent-controller-options-150055872.html?src=rss,"The Apple Vision Pro is an impressive piece of hardware, and the eye-tracking/hand gesture input combo is fantastic for navigating menus and the like. It’s not so great for gaming. There haven't been many easy ways to connect a third-party controller for playing iPad or cloud games. This is changing, however, as accessory manufacturer 8BitDo just announced Vision Pro compatibility for a number of its controllers. These accessories are officially supported by Apple, so they should work as soon as you make a Bluetooth connection. No muss and no fuss. All told, eight devices got the Apple seal of approval here. One such gadget is the company’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller, which we basically called the perfect gamepad for PC. Other compatible devices include various iterations of the SN30 Pro controller, the Lite 2 and the NES-inspired N30 Pro 2. The integration isn’t just for game controllers, as 8BitDo also announced AVP compatibility for its Retro Mechanical Keyboard. Of course, the Vision Pro works out of the box with most Bluetooth keyboards. This is pretty big news, however, as media consumption is one of the best parts of the Vision Pro experience. Video games fall squarely in that category. Just about every iPad title works on the device. If playing Cut the Rope on a giant virtual screen doesn’t do it for you, the headset also integrates with Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia GeForce Now for access to AAA titles. 8BitDo announced official controller support for Apple devices last year, though this was primarily for smartphones, tablets and Mac computers. The integration was thanks to new controller firmware and Apple's recent iOS 16.3, iPadOS 16.3, tvOS 16.3 and macOS 13.2 updates. It looks like all of the accessories that work with iPhones and iPads also work with the Vision Pro. Apple's AirPods Pro (second-generation) are $60 off in a deal on Amazon, bringing the price don to just $190. The AirPods Pro normally cost $250. They come with active noise cancellation, adaptive audio, and personalized spatial audio. To find out all the details of watching and recording the total solar eclipse on April 8, read on. Former Geek Squad workers who lost their jobs this week told 404 Media that Best Buy is conducting mass layoffs, though no numbers have yet been confirmed.

A report by The New York Times claims both OpenAI and Google transcribed videos from YouTube and used these texts to train their AI models, possibly violating copyrights.

Here’s What Reviewers Are Saying About the Apple Vision Pro,2024-04-05T14:59:12+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/apple-vision-pro-reviews-mixed-vr-ar-1851208941,"Apple’s Vision Pro is set to make landfall from the company’s Cupertino spaceship headquarters Friday. Still, those who got to spend time with it early could finally break their silence Tuesday morning. From the fore, reviewers have walked away impressed with the VR headset’s strong displays, best-in-class passthrough, and hand tracking, but many also wonder just how much use they can get out of a $3,500 headset sporting a connected two-hour battery pack. Among reviewers, the most consistent praise was directed to the hardware, at least in terms of how much power it packs and how capable its eye- and hand-tracking sensors are. So far, most of the people who have tested the Vision Pro have called it one of the most advanced and consumer-ready all-in-one AR headsets released so far, though it’s brought down by a fair lack of apps or practical use cases. There’s a lot to talk about, considering it’s such an expensive device promising to replace or compliment your other Apple desktop devices. Still, reviewers seem to agree the headset can handle all that you can throw at it. It’s running on the M2 chip, and Tom’s Guide noted that there was minimal lag running multiple apps like Slack Apple Music and streaming the screen from their MacBook with a simple glance, and all at the same time. You can access these apps from a digital crown akin to the Apple Watch, and these windows can be resized and placed around the room with relative ease. Most reviewers praised the system’s 4K mini-OLED displays and low-latency passthrough capability. CNET’s Scott Stein called it “the best wearable display” he’s used so far, even above those that use base stations or those that require additional devices in the room. The passthrough will warn users if they walk too close to an object and also “ghost” other people who walk into the user’s field of view. Reviewers noted the Vision Pro has a solid pair of screens for working in the (currently rather limited) selection of virtual environments or for watching 3D movies. Apple’s often given credit for the click wheel interface on its old iPod models, despite similar, earlier designs that used a wheel interface. In a similar way, while many other devices have stressed eye and hand-tracking, Apple seems to have come away with something impressive, if perhaps still needing a few software updates. Stein wrote that hand and eye tracking even works in low-light conditions. While most sites lauded the pinch method for controls, The Washington Post noted that the virtual keyboard isn’t as good as it could be, either by typing with your eyes or pinching keys. One area of concern that’s cropped up constantly since a select few had a chance to try on the Vision Pro is the headset’s weight and comfort. It’s 1.4 pounds (excluding the external battery pack), but there have been a few lingering complaints that it caused headaches or neck strain. The Wall Street Journal’s Joanna Stern said she wore it for a full 24 hours (taking it off to sle...",2
Apple Vision Pro Hands-on: Brilliant AR Capabilities That Still Cost Too Darn Much,2024-04-05T14:58:54+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/apple-vision-pro-1851249913,"I had just 30 minutes to test out Apple’s $3,500 Vision Pro headset. Others who received a review unit from Apple or purchased one themselves have spent a week or more with it by this point. We’ve seen a lot of interesting use cases for the headset and an equal number of people hawking dumb and potentially dangerous Vision Pro clips for clicks. The latter has gotten so notorious they’ve been dubbed “Vision Bros.” After my short stint in Apple’s new, beautiful, and very impressive “spatial” environment, I’m not sure if there’s any reason for anybody who doesn’t have thousands of bucks to burn or a burning need for fleeting internet fame should ever consider owning one. By the time a little more than a week had passed since the Vision Pro first hit store shelves, we were left with dwindling options for actually getting our hands on one. Former Gizmodo staff had a fair few good things to say about the headset when Apple first announced it, but a full review unit was not in the cards. The base $3,500 for a new Apple-brand headset is equivalent to a month and a half of my salary before taxes. I’m still paying off my iPhone 14 Pro in $50 allotments month after month. So, if I had the choice of paying for rent or purchasing a VR headset, I’d go for the roof over my head. Sure, a spatial video of a dinner table will look rather good on a Vision Pro, but I’d probably prefer real sustenance over any virtual meal. My in-store Vision Pro demo was limited to just a few apps under a strict time limit, but I was able to gauge the quality of the controls and pass through quickly. In just a few words, it’s the most capable hand and eye tracking of any VR headset I’ve used. Its depth of colors on its twin 4K mini-LED displays was unmatched, and the controls are simple and intuitive enough that I picked up the gist in just a few minutes. Its spatial video and photos had a very unique, 3D effect that reminded me of the hologram video from the Minority Report movie. The 3D movies indeed look very good on Apple’s headset. Ignore the impressive hardware specs for a second, as it’s clear the biggest boon for the Vision Pro is its software. The gesture controls were extraordinarily intuitive, and it’s obvious the company put a lot of man-hours into how users would neatly reorganize their workstations. You can leave a window anywhere in your field of view. Apple promised a true revolution of computing, but despite the company’s directive to never use the letters “V” and “R” together when talking about their new headset, the real question we should is how good the Vision Pro is compared to other VR headsets. I’ve used other modern, top-of-the-line VR from companies like Varjo and their latest XR-4 enterprise-level headset. Varjo’s $3,990 headset doesn’t quite have the same level of eye tracking as Apple’s latest device, but it, too, uses 4K, micro-OLED internal displays. I would need to have both together for a true side-by-side as to overall pixel density, clarity, and de...",-2
