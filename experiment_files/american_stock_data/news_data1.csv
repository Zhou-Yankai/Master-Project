New York college becomes 1st university with on-campus IBM quantum computer that is 'scientifically useful',2024-04-05T14:35:32+00:00,https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/rensselaer-polytechnic-institute-ibm-university-on-campus-quantum-computer-scientifically-useful,"When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. IBM's latest System One quantum computer is based at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and is the 1st IBM quantum machine to be installed at a university campus in the U.S. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York, has unveiled a new campus-based quantum computer that can be used for scientific discovery — rather than one that's just used to run proof-of-concept trials. The new IBM System One quantum computer is powered by a processor called ""Eagle"" that has 127 quantum bits, or qubits, IBM representatives said April 5 in a statement. This quantum processing unit (QPU) was first announced in 2021 and debuted in a  System One machine in November last year that is used by the University of Tokyo. This quantum computer is not based on campus. The company described the machine as ""utility-scale"" because it's powerful enough to serve as a scientific tool and help solve problems scientists would struggle with otherwise using conventional supercomputers alone. RPI staff and students will be able to utilize the quantum computer to explore problems in chemistry, physics, material science and other fields, IBM said in the statement. ""When we describe “utility-scale,” we’re specifically referring to how quantum computers can now serve as scientific tools to explore new classes of problems in chemistry, physics, materials, and other fields that are beyond the reach of brute-force classical computing techniques,"" Jamie Garcia, technical program director for algorithms & partnerships at IBM Quantum, told Live Science. Related: Error-corrected qubits 800 times more reliable after breakthrough, paving the way for 'next level' of quantum computing ""Put simply, quantum computers are now better at running quantum circuits than a classical supercomputer is at simulating them. This means, for the first time in history, quantum computers can be used as a computational tool for scientific exploration."" Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. In June 2023 IBM scientists demonstrated the power of Eagle by using a machine fitted with the QPU to simulate the magnetic properties of a real material faster than a classical computer could. —World's 1st fault-tolerant quantum computer launching this year ahead of a 10,000-qubit machine in 2026 —World's 1st graphene semiconductor could power future quantum computers —How could this new type of room-temperature qubit usher in the next phase of quantum computing? Quantum computers have the potential to be far more powerful than classical computers, but only if they're scaled up and the errors in qubits are mitigated. IBM's QPUs, and others like them, employ error-correction technologies to reduce the error rate of qubits, which can be highly error-prone — or ""noisy."" Scientists don't expect to achieve ""quantum supremacy"" — in which quantum computers are more powe...",3

The zone also highlights industry solutions for the government, retail and energy sectors. “We are excited to present our clients with the opportunity to leverage the joint capabilities of IBM Consulting and Microsoft under a single roof and help them unlock the full potential of AI and hybrid cloud across the enterprise,” said Amit Sharma, managing partner, global delivery, IBM Consulting. Inside the technology stations, organisations can explore business solutions for cloud modernisation, data, analytics and advanced AI, customer relationship management, finance and operations, IoT and edge, and augmented and virtual reality, IBM Consulting said. The zone will also offer opportunities for organisations to connect with experts and peers who are harnessing generative AI and access industry case studies.",2
Tech giants hatch a plan for AI job losses: Reskill 95 million in 10 years,2024-04-04T21:07:13+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/tech-giants-hatch-a-plan-for-ai-job-losses-reskill-95-million-in-10-years/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular Some of the biggest tech companies in the world -- including those heavily invested in artificial intelligence -- have formed a consortium to address the impact of jobs lost to AI. Also: AI will have a big impact on jobs this year. Here's why that could be good news Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft, and SAP, along with six advisers, have formed the AI-Enabled Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Workforce Consortium to help those who have lost or will lose their jobs to AI to either upskill or reskill to reenter the workforce. The consortium will help impacted workers to find training programs and connect businesses with companies looking for their skillsets. ""The mission of our newly unveiled AI-Enabled Workforce Consortium is to provide organizations with knowledge about the impact of AI on the workforce and equip workers with relevant skills,"" Cisco executive vice president and chief people, policy & purpose officer Francine Katsoudas said in a statement. It's no secret that workers around the globe are being impacted by AI adoption. Several companies, including UPS and IBM, have already acknowledged that they're laying off or freezing hiring because of AI. In total, US companies have cut more than 4,600 jobs as they seek new AI-ready hires or replace positions with AI, according to a study earlier this year from outplacement companies Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Of course, many of those cuts are driven by the AI innovations that ICT participants developed. And while consortium members acknowledged that lost jobs are a reality -- and that many jobs will be replaced entirely by AI -- they're hoping that upskilling and reskilling support will help workers find new careers in other roles. Also: These are the jobs most likely to be taken over by AI As part of that effort, the companies said their goal is to ""positively impact over 95 million individuals around the world over the next 10 years."" While that's a decidedly nebulous goal, the companies offered up some specifics: To be clear, the aforementioned goals are just that -- goals. And while it's possible the companies could meet or even exceed those numbers, it's also possible they don't. Clearly, the ICT has its work cut out for it. Also: Beyond programming: AI spawns a new generation of job roles To get there, the companies said they first plan to look at how AI has impacted 56 unidentified job roles that make up 80 percent of the top 45 job titles, based on the volume of job postings, since last year. Then they plan to make recommendations on how to move forward with ensuring workers have the requisite skills that the ICT companies are looking for to reach their lofty goals.",2

Microsoft's Copilot key for Windows 11 AI PCs has a secret - it dates back to the mid-1980s,2024-04-03T11:06:02+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97309/microsoft-copilot-key-for-windows-11-ai-pcs-has-secret-it-dates-back-to-the-mid-1980s/index.html,"You've doubtless heard about the Copilot key - the dedicated physical key that's present on the keyboard of AI PCs running Windows 11 - but there's a surprising secret behind this new feature. The Copilot key will likely prove controversial - but you can remap it (Image Credit: Microsoft) This was highlighted by Tom's Hardware, who did some digging with new Dell XPS 14 and XPS 16 laptops that have the Copilot key on their respective keyboard decks, in an effort to find out how the key works. In other words, what's behind the Copilot key in terms of mapping, and is it a new key with a new scan code? Well, the answer to that question is a short no. The longer answer, as presented by Tom's Hardware, is that the Copilot key is actually a shortcut comprising of three keys - Left Ctrl + Windows key + F23. That was the discovery made using an open-source keyboard macro scripting tool, AutoHotkey, which also logs what keystrokes register as. Your first thought is likely to be: F23? What now? Yes, function keys these days only go up to F12 typically, but way back in the early days of PCs - we're talking about the 1980s, and IBM computers, in fact - function keys extended all the way up to F24. So, the Copilot key mapping is actually based on keyboards from the mid-80s, which is quite a bizarre turn of events. You can remap the key, mind, as Tom's outlines, using AutoHotkey (or a similar utility), and that may well be an option some folks choose to exercise - as not everyone will want a dedicated Copilot key. Not everyone wants to summon the desktop-based AI assistant at all, in fact, although there's no way to remove the functionality (not officially, anyway - although you can disable icons and the like). Copilot is a big part of the future, the way Microsoft envisages it, seeing as the dedicated key for the AI is actually part of the requirements for an AI PC - another somewhat bizarre move in our books. But one which clearly illustrates how much weight Microsoft is placing on Copilot going forward. The last dedicated key Microsoft added to the keyboard of Windows devices was, well, the Windows key itself. And that was almost 30 years ago now... Right now, the AI is quite limited in its functionality - as regards modifying Windows settings anyway - but the eventual idea is that the assistant will be capable of activating a myriad of options based off one simple request (like 'make me more productive').
