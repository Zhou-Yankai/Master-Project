No prize, other than bragging rights. Do these numbers include the cars produced only to sit in an empty field and never driven? I am no fan the CPP. From some other online news article: The field of cars was explored by Inside China Auto on YouTube, who translated the markings on the cars to explain their origins.

However, a closer look reveals the opposite to be true: These are **not new EV**s, and they only number in the hundreds. Most are five to six years old and have seen significant use, with aftermarket accessories, trash in their interiors, and other signs of wear. That's because you're looking at a fleet of retired rideshare cars that were once operated in large cities in China. The way Inside China Auto tells it, there was an e-bike sharing bubble in 2016 that was rapidly copied by services offering short-range EV rentals. But just like in the United States, these ventures struggled, as they were far more expensive to start and maintain than bike sharing.  Those cars are the result of failed EV car sharing business.

Tesla Cybertruck gets less than 80% of Tesla’s advertised range in YouTuber’s highway test,2024-01-05T19:44:28+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/01/05/business/tesla-cybertruck-achieves-less-than-80-of-teslas-advertised-range/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 A YouTuber took Tesla’s Cybertruck on a ride to see if it can actually hit its advertised 320-mile range, only to find out that its could only reach 79% of the target. When YouTuber Kyle Conner, known on the platform as Out of Spec Motoring, livestreamed an unofficial range test of the Cyberbeast model of the long-awaited electric pickup truck, it only lasted 254 miles before needing another charge. Per Tesla’s website, the Cyberbeast — which retails for a cool $99,990 — can last as long as 320 miles on a full charge, which could take anywhere from seven to roughly 14.5 hours to achieve depending on the charging socket, according to international electric car database EV Compare. During Conner’s five-hour livestream, which was earlier reported on by Business Insider, he drove the vehicle on a highway in Texas for about 70 miles per hour, on a night when temperatures were around 45 degrees. In the video, Connor set out to drive his Cybertruck from a 100% charge until the battery died.  When the steel truck notified Connor that it was left with just a 1% charge and 12 miles to go, he pulled it into a mall parking lot, where he looped around the shopping center until the car came to a complete stop. Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. Tesla, which released a tri-motor all-wheel drive (AWD) Cyberbeast, dual-motor AWD model and rear-wheel drive (RWD) model of the Cybertruck in North America in December 2023, offers a range extender, which it says increases the vehicle’s mileage to over 470. However, range can be impacted by a number of factors, including temperature — as cold weather is often known to drain range faster — as well as tires and weight load, according to Insider. Not all models of the Cybertruck have even been released yet: An entry-level, rear-wheel-drive version of the Cybertruck is expected to ship in 2025 to those willing to dish out $60,990 for it.  Meanwhile, Elon Musk already has his sights set on making his beloved Cybertruck able to traverse landscapes, teasing last month that the electric vehicle may soon be able to function as a boat. “We are going to offer a mod package that enables Cybertruck to traverse at least 100m of water as a boat,” Musk shared to X in response to a video excerpt from an episode of “Jay Leno’s Garage.” In the clip, where Leno takes a Cybertruck for a spin, Tesla’s vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy tells the TV host that the steel truck could be made into a boat with some simple tweaks. “The vehicle almost floats, maybe you have to add a little bit of extra buoyancy just to keep it up,” Moravy told Leno. “If you’re creative, and you want, you could figure out how to put an outboard motor, plugged into your outlet there, turn it on from your screen, and go boating,” he added. Musk chimed in with an X post saying: “Mostly just need to upgrade cabin door seals.” So far, only a ...",-2

Ticker: China sanctions 5 defense companies; Tesla recalls 1.6 million EVs exported to China  ,2024-01-07T22:23:05+00:00,https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/01/07/ticker-china-sanctions-5-defense-companies-tesla-recalls-1-6-million-evs-exported-to-china/,"E-Edition Sign up for email newsletters  Sign up for email newsletters E-Edition 
			Trending:		 China announced sanctions Sunday on five American defense-related companies in response to U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and U.S sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals. The sanctions will freeze any property the companies have in China and prohibit organizations and individuals in China from doing business with them, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted online. It was unclear what impact, if any, the sanctions would have on the companies, BAE Systems Land and Armaments, Alliant Techsystems Operations, AeroVironment, Viasat and Data Link Solutions. Such sanctions are often mostly symbolic as American defense contractors generally don’t sell to China. The Foreign Ministry said the U.S. moves harmed China’s sovereignty and security interests, undermined peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and violated the rights and interests of Chinese companies and individuals. Tesla is recalling more than 1.6 million Model S, X, 3 and Y electric vehicles exported to China for problems with their automatic assisted steering and door latch controls. China’s State Administration for Market Regulation announced the recall on Friday. It said Tesla Motors in Beijing and Shanghai would use remote upgrades to fix the problems, so in most cases car owners would not need to visit Tesla service centers. The recall due to problems with the automatic steering assist function applies to 1.6 million imported Tesla Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Ys. When the automatic steering function is engaged, drivers might misuse the combined driving function, increasing a risk of accidents, the notice said. The recalls follow a recall in the U.S. last month of more than 2 million of Tesla EVs to improve its system for monitoring drivers. Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group",-2

"Report: Elon Musk’s Alleged Drug Use Creating Problems for Tesla, SpaceX Board Members",2024-01-08T22:46:47+00:00,https://sfist.com/2024/01/08/report-elon-musks-alleged-drug-use-creating-problems-for-tesla-spacex-board-members/,"After a Wall Street Journal report this weekend said Elon Musk has been using cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, ketamine, and magic mushrooms, Musk issued non-denials, but top executives of his companies remain worried about the fallout. It is well-known that Tesla CEO Elon Musk smoked marijuana on camera during a taping of the Joe Rogan podcast in 2018. But a report this weekend in the Wall Street Journal tied Musk to using cocaine, ecstasy, LSD, ketamine, and magic mushrooms, and has obviously created a wee bit of anxiety for top-level board members at Musk’s companies Tesla and SpaceX. Elon Musk’s use of drugs—including LSD, cocaine, ecstasy, mushrooms and ketamine—has made some Tesla and SpaceX leaders worry about potential risk to his companies. https://t.co/ZHQip3uPAT https://t.co/ZHQip3uPAT The report is behind a paywall, but to summarize: it says Musk used many of the above-mentioned drugs at several parties at which all guests had to sign non-disclosure agreements, between 2018 and 2021. It also describes a 2017 all-hands meeting at SpaceX where Musk gave a speech that was reportedly “nonsensical,” “unhinged,” and “cringeworthy,” before SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell had to step in and take over. And of course, Musk has openly admitted to using ketamine.  After that one puff with Rogan, I agreed, at NASA’s request, to do 3 years of random drug testing.Not even trace quantities were found of any drugs or alcohol. @WSJ is not fit to line a parrot cage for bird 💩 Musk has since responded to the report. “After that one puff with Rogan, I agreed, at NASA’s request, to do 3 years of random drug testing,” he posted to Xitter Sunday. “Not even trace quantities were found of any drugs or alcohol. @WSJ is not fit to line a parrot cage for bird 💩.” Musk’s attorney Alex Spiro told the Journal that Musk is “regularly and randomly drug tested at SpaceX and has never failed a test,” and added that “there are other false facts” in the Journal article, though he didn’t specify which ones. If drugs actually helped improve my net productivity over time, I would definitely take them! Musk further posted Sunday that “Whatever I’m doing, I should obviously keep doing it!” and ""If drugs actually helped improve my net productivity over time, I would definitely take them!” Those statements certainly sound like non-denials. Elon Musk’s drug use is the latest headache for Tesla’s board https://t.co/Tk9wbBOVly But Bloomberg reports that all this drug talk around Musk could be trouble for the Tesla and SpaceX boards of directors. “This will give ammunition to class-action lawyers on behalf of disgruntled shareholders at Tesla, if they can tie evidence of drug use to his actual role as an executive,” Santa Clara University School of Law professor Stephen Diamond told Bloomberg. “The Tesla board has an obligation to discern what’s going on here.” The real problem could be for SpaceX, which is massively reliant on government contracts, and Musk’s erratic behavior being attribut...",-3

Tesla Model 3 Highland Arrives In The US: Here's What's Changed,2024-01-10T17:03:37+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1489655/tesla-model-3-highland-arrives-in-us/,"
In August last year, Tesla introduced a new, refreshed version of the Model 3 dubbed the Highland trim, rocking an aesthetic touch-up on the front and some internal refinements. Starting today, the car is now up for grabs in the U.S., and notably, the price remains the same as the previous edition. The changes start with the number of configurations available, which now stand at two instead of three for the older version that has now been phased out.





The single-motor rear-wheel drive model starts at $38,990, while the dual-motor all-wheel drive variant has a base price of $45,990 before taxes and incentives. Tesla has two new colors on the table for its most affordable electric car: Stealth Grey and Ultra Red, with fresh wheel styling to go with it. There is no ""Performance"" model this time around.
The range of the entry-level variant stands at 272 miles (EPA estimate), married to 0-60 mph acceleration figures of 5.8 seconds, while the Long Range iteration can go up to 341 miles on a single charge and can clock 0-60 mph in just 4.2 seconds. However, the top speed has been dialed down to 125 miles per hour, down from the older version's 140 mph (Standard), 145 mph (Long Range), and 150+ mph (Performance) numbers.

The 2024 Tesla Model 3 features a redesigned front with sharper LED styling and sportier contouring, which the company says assists with improving the aerodynamics. This one just looks better, with a less utilitarian take on the front LEDs, and really shines in the red coat. Inside the cabin, the car embraces a wraparound look accentuated with customizable ambient light. Tesla claims to have refined the material quality adorning the cabin space, making tweaks such as a perforated surface finish. The company is also se...",3
Red Sea attacks halt Tesla production Germany,2024-01-11T23:18:00+00:00,https://www.dw.com/en/red-sea-attacks-halt-tesla-production-germany/a-67959260?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf,"US electric car manufacturer Tesla will temporarily stop production at a factory outside Berlin. Attacks on ships in the Red Sea mean the factory cannot get the parts it needs to maintain operations. Electric car maker Tesla will suspend most car production at its factory near the German capital of Berlin for two weeks, the company said on Thursday. ""Due to a lack of components, we are forced to suspend vehicle production at the Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg between January 29 and February 11, with the exception of a few sub-areas,"" Tesla said in a statement. The company blamed the component shortage on shifts in shipping routes caused by the crisis in the Red Sea, where Iranian-backed Houthi militants have been attacking ships in solidarity with the Palestinian militant-Islamist group Hamas, which is fighting Israel in Gaza. ""The armed conflicts in the Red Sea and the associated shifts in transport routes between Europe and Asia via the Cape of Good Hope are also having an impact on production in Grünheide,"" Tesla said. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video The US electric vehicle maker is the first company to announce an interruption to output due to the disruption. Many companies, including Geely, China's second-largest automaker by sales, and Swedish home furnishing company Ikea, have warned of delays to deliveries. The attacks by Iranian-backed Houthi militants have forced the world's top shipping companies to avoid the Suez Canal, the fastest maritime route from Asia to Europe. It accounts for about 12% of global maritime traffic. Shipping giants such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have been sending their vessels on longer, more expensive journeys around South Africa's Cape of Good Hope. The extra route adds about 10 days in a journey from Asia to northern Europe and about $1 million (€910 000) in extra fuel. ""The considerably longer transportation times are creating a gap in supply chains,"" Tesla said. The company has been manufacturing electric cars in Grünheide near Berlin since March 2022, with around 11,500 people employed there. dh/sms (dpa, Reuters)",-3
Illinois lands federal grant to install 273 EV charging centers,2024-01-11T23:14:25+00:00,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2024/1/11/24034981/illinois-ev-charging-stations-expansion-jb-pritzker,"Bernie Powell plugs in his Tesla Model Y for charging at a Tesla charging station at the Target located at 2656 N. Elston Ave., Friday, May 19, 2023. More charging stations are coming to Illinois. Tyler Pasciak LaRiviere/Sun-Times Electric vehicle charging stations will be installed in 273 new locations across Illinois thanks to a $14.9 million federal grant, officials announced Thursday.  The new sites will add a total of 845 publicly accessible chargers, including 36 fast-charging stations, through a competitive grant awarded to Illinois by the U.S. Department of Transportation.  “As Illinois moves toward a clean energy future, it is imperative that no communities are left behind,” Gov.

Pritzker said in a statement. “This investment from our partners at the federal level will ensure Illinois has the resources to make electric vehicles accessible to all our residents.” The state currently has 1,249 public charging locations with a total of 3,278 ports, according to the latest tally by the U.S. Department of Energy.  Pritzker’s office said the new charging locations “aren’t locked in yet,” but 43% were earmarked for “disadvantaged community projects” and 63% percent were designated for “dense urban communities with a high percentage of multi-family housing,” including rural areas and small towns.  Expanding charging infrastructure is a foundation of Pritzker’s goal to have 1 million electric vehicles on the road by the end of the decade.  As of mid-December, 91,451 EVs were registered statewide, including 24,978 in Cook County and 16,427 in Chicago, according to the Illinois Secretary of State’s office.  The state is eventually aiming to have a public charger available within every 50 miles along major highway corridors statewide. “I’m glad that this funding will prioritize equity by helping make EV charging sites more accessible to all Illinoisans — no matter if they live in an urban area or a rural community,” Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth said in a statement along with fellow Sen. Dick Durbin, who called it “a key step in breaking down barriers to entry for disadvantaged communities.” The state is still accepting applications through Jan. 31 for electric vehicle rebates of up to $4,000 per car or truck or $1,500 for a motorcycle — though the number of applications had already exceeded the allotted $12 million of allotted rebate funding by mid-November.  Low-income applicants will be prioritized in handing out the rebates, officials said.    © 2024 Chicago Sun-Times Media, Inc.",2
EV Sales & Resale Values Tank As Hertz Dump EV Fleet,2024-01-11T23:03:13+00:00,https://www.channelnews.com.au/ev-sales-resale-values-tank-as-hertz-dump-ev-fleet/,"Hertz Global are scaling back renting electric cars as the market for secondhand EV vehicles on particular Tesla vehicles crash and repair costs skyrocket, the fleet is being replaced with petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles. Rental Companies make their money when it comes to selling their rental cars and the collapse in price is having a major impact on their revenues.
Back in 2021 Hertz announced plans to buy 100,000 vehicles which they are now realizing was a big mistake. As a result, they plan to sell a major share of its US electric vehicle fleet and reinvest in petrol powered cars due to weak demand and high repair costs for its battery-powered options. Initially they are hoping to sell 20,000 EVs according to a regulatory filing. Hertz will record a non-cash charge in its fourth-quarter results of about $245 million related to incremental net depreciation expense. The dramatic about-face comes as US drivers who purchased an EV vehicle moving back to petrol vehicles a move that underscores the waning demand for all-electric cars in the US. EV sales growth slowed sharply over the course of 2023, rising just 1.3% in the final quarter as consumers were put off by high costs, interest rates expensive repair costs and the falling value of secondhand EV vehicles. “The elevated costs associated with EVs persisted,” Hertz Chief Executive Officer Stephen Scherr said in an interview. “Efforts to wrestle it down proved to be more challenging.” The shift back to more conventional cars by businesses who initially invested in EV vehicles is now having an impact on sales. The move marks a reversal of a strategy centered initially on EVs by several businesses. The plan to unload EVs should improve Hertz’s cash flow and earnings this year and next. By year-end 2025, the company expects improved financial results driven by higher revenue per day and lower depreciation and operating expenses.   02 9002 5900   [email protected] Level 1, 275 Alfred Street

Update: Two children die in crash on Highway 152 east of Gilroy,2024-01-12T23:03:38+00:00,https://gilroydispatch.com/update-two-children-die-in-crash-on-highway-152-east-of-gilroy/,"Crash occurred about 7am Jan. 12 near Lake Road Two Morgan Hill children died in a five-vehicle traffic collision on Highway 152 east of Gilroy in Santa Clara County the morning of Jan. 12, according to the California Highway Patrol.  CHP officers responded to the scene of the crash just after 7am. The initial investigation determined that a 2021 Tesla, driven by a Los Banos man, was traveling westbound on Highway 152 just west of Lake Road, behind a 2015 Peterbilt tractor trailer, driven by a Petaluma man, says a press release from the CHP Hollister-Gilroy Office.  The Tesla driver began to use the eastbound lane to attempt to pass the Peterbilt. The front right of the Tesla collided with the front right of an oncoming 2018 Honda, which was traveling in the eastbound lane of Highway 152, authorities said. The collision caused the Tesla to lose control before colliding head-on with a 2017 Dodge, driven by a Morgan Hill man in the eastbound lane of Highway 152. Another adult and three children—ages 1, 4 and 7—were traveling as passengers in the Dodge.  This impact caused the Dodge to spin out into the westbound lane and into the path of the Peterbilt, which collided with the left side of the Dodge, CHP said.  The Tesla continued to travel out of control in a westerly direction and collided with another vehicle, a 2020 Subaru that was moving eastbound on Highway 152, says the press release. The Peterbilt continued in a southwesterly direction through a privately owned fence next to the road.  CHP said emergency personnel arrived and began rendering aid to the injured parties. The Tesla driver was transported by ambulance to San Jose Regional Medical Center with major injuries.  A passenger of the Dodge, a 4-year-old girl from Morgan Hill, was transported to Santa Clara Valley Medical Center, where the child died of her injuries, according to police. A 7-year-old Morgan Hill girl, also a passenger in the Dodge, suffered fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash.  Authorities have not publicly identified the children who died in the collision.  A 1-year-old boy who was traveling in the Dodge was uninjured, according to the CHP press release.  Three occupants of the Honda, driven by a San Jose woman, suffered minor injuries, police said. The driver of the Subaru also suffered minor injuries.  No drivers were arrested or cited at the scene. Investigators do not know if alcohol or drugs were a factor in the crash, the CHP said.  Anyone who witnessed or has information about the accident can call the CHP Hollister-Gilroy Office at 408.427.0700.  -PAID ADVERTISEMENT- Why hasn’t the driver of the Tesla been named?

Tesla Gets A $94 Billion Reality Check As EV Winter Sets In,2024-01-13T16:58:03+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/tesla-gets-a-94-billion-reality-check-as-ev-winter-sets-in,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. had a blockbuster 2023, as its shares more than doubled in 12 months. But 2024 is starting on a different note, with Elon Musk’s electric vehicle maker off to its worst start to any year.  The company has lost more than $94 billion in market valuation in just the first two weeks of 2024. It’s not hard to figure out why, as the Austin, Texas-based EV maker has been pounded by a barrage of negative news: an about-face on EVs from the car rental giant Hertz Global Holdings Inc., yet another price cut for its cars made in China, and signs of rising labor costs.  All of this comes in the face of slowing growth in demand for EVs, especially in the US.  “Investors’ main concern on Tesla is stagnating growth,” Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne said in an interview. The price cuts in China only fan those concerns, because it is starting to look like “a race to the bottom for the EV industry given intense competition in that market.”     The hit to Tesla’s market capitalization to start the year is the biggest the company has seen over a similar period since it went public in 2010. In percentage terms, Tesla’s 12% drop since the start of January is the worst since 2016, when the stock fell 14% over the first nine trading days of the year.  To make matters worse, the odds of an imminent turnaround for the EV maker don’t look good.    Tesla has been cutting prices on its cars aggressively since early 2023 in an effort to boost demand. But the result has been a steady erosion of its once-hefty profit margin. Tesla’s automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits for the third quarter fell to 16.3% from 27.9% a year ago. And the pressure is only mounting, now that production workers at Tesla’s US plants are getting pay raises.  “We are going through a cyclical downturn for EVs, but competitive dynamics are exacerbating the cyclical pressures,” Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer at Spear Invest, said in an interview. “Price cuts and plummeting margins are all a function of these unfavorable competitive dynamics.”  Adding to the woes, Tesla has had to re-route shipments destined for its Berlin plant after Western military actions and security concerns in the Red Sea, and is suspending most production at its plant near Berlin from Jan. 29 to Feb. 11, according to a person familiar with the matter. Not Strong Enough Tesla first warned about the deceleration in EV demand during its October third-quarter earnings report. Almost immediately after, automakers and suppliers across the globe chimed in with their own downbeat forecasts. Many carmakers dialed back their plans for expansion.  Then, earlier this month, Tesla reported its fourth-quarter delivery numbers. While they were better than what analysts expected, they put the company behind China’s BYD Co. in global electric-car sales. The result has been a rude awakening for Tesla investors. Last year, the stock was the eighth best performer in the S&P 500. So far this year, it’s the eigh...",-3

The price cuts in China only fan those concerns, because it is starting to look like “a race to the bottom for the EV industry given intense competition in that market.” The hit to Tesla’s market capitalisation to start the year is the biggest the company has seen over a similar period since it went public in 2010.

To make matters worse, the odds of an imminent turnaround for the EV maker don’t look good. Tesla has been cutting prices on its cars aggressively since early 2023 in an effort to boost demand.

Elon’s Tesla robot is sort of ‘ok’ at folding laundry in pre-scripted demo,2024-01-15T19:27:23+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/15/elons-tesla-robot-is-sort-of-ok-at-folding-laundry-in-pre-scripted-demo/,"Elon Musk’s Optimus humanoid robot from Tesla is doing more stuff — this time folding a t-shirt on a table in a development facility. The robot looks to be fairly competent when it comes to this task, but moments after Musk shared the video, he also shared some follow-up information which definitely dampens some of the enthusiasm for the robot’s domestic feat. First, I can definitely fold shirts faster than that. Second, Optimus wasn’t acting autonomously, which is obviously the end goal. Instead, the robot is here acting like a very expensive marionette, or at best a modern facsimile of the first rudimentary automotons, going through prescribed motions to accomplish its task. Musk said that eventually, it will “certainly be able to do this fully autonomously,” however, and without the highly artificial constraints in place for this demo, including the fixed-height table and single article of clothing in the carefully placed basket. Optimus folds a shirt pic.twitter.com/3F5o3jVLq1 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 15, 2024  Tesla has shown off a fair bit of technical wizardry with recent highlight reels released by the company, but the likely scenario is that all of these are highly scripted and preprogrammed activities that do more to show off the impressive functionality of the bot’s joints, servos and limbs than its artificial intelligence. Elon’s caveat, when considered for even a second, actually amounts to “all the very hard things will happen later.” Not to knock the difficulty in creating a humanoid machine that can manipulate soft materials like clothing in a manner approximating human interaction with said objects; that’s some mighty fine animatronics work. But suggesting that this puts them anywhere near the realm where Optimus will be operating as a fully functional domestic servant with all the capabilities of a human domestic worker it might replace would be like showing a video of a wooden marionette and adding “of course, this will be a real boy soon.” Musk is famous for claiming that things are going to happen in a time frame that makes absolutely no sense, but his prediction of “within three to five years” made at the bot prototype’s original unveiling last year (not counting the year before when it was just a guy in a suit) is laughable given its current state, and the current state of the art for robotics in general. Tl;dr — don’t start reassigning your laundry folding time just yet.",-1

European Production Pauses for Tesla and Volvo Amid the Crisis in Red Sea Shipping,2024-01-15T12:05:00+00:00,https://insightssuccess.com/european-production-pauses-for-tesla-and-volvo-amid-the-crisis-in-red-sea-shipping/,"Last week, Tesla and Volvo declared that they were stopping part of their manufacturing in Europe due to a lack of parts brought on by shipping being diverted away from the Suez Canal and Red Sea due to the threat of attack from Houthi insurgents in Yemen who are backed by Iran. Due to a shortage of parts on ships that were diverted from the Red Sea and Suez Canal and instead traveled around the southern tip of Africa, or the Cape of Good Hope, Tesla informed Reuters on Thursday that it will be stopping most car manufacturing at its Gigafactory near Berlin from January 29 to February 11. “The armed conflicts in the Red Sea and the associated shifts in transport routes between Europe and Asia via the Cape of Good Hope are having an impact on production in Gruenheide,” a statement from Tesla stated. “The considerably longer transportation times are creating a gap in supply chains.” Tesla assembles its electric vehicles that are sold in Europe in the Berlin-Brandenburg Gigafactory, which is situated close to Gruenheide. The components that are experiencing delays and are impacting the factory’s operations were not disclosed by the corporation. Due to a delayed gearbox delivery, Volvo, which is mostly owned by the Chinese company Geely, said that it will stop production at its Ghent, Belgium, plant for three days next week. Along with maritime behemoths like Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, some tanker operators have ceased operating in the Red Sea due to the Houthi attacks on shipping and have instead rerouted their cargo around Africa. Maersk stated in early January that it anticipates the re-routing, which adds roughly 10 days and carries an extra $1 million in fuel costs, to continue for some time. The Houthi rebels, who are supported by Iran, have demonstrated against Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza. Many of the targeted ships have no connection to Israel, despite the Houthis’ declaration that they would solely attack Israeli warships or ships bound for Israeli ports. along a joint statement released last week, 14 nations—including the United States—said that “the Houthis will bear the consequences should they continue to threaten lives, the global economy, or the free flow of commerce in the region’s critical waterways.” Read More: https://insightssuccess.com/ Insights Success is an archway that caters to Entrepreneurs’ quench of technology and business updates which are currently ruling the business world.

Elon Musk Wants More Compensation Out of Tesla to Move More Toward AI,2024-01-16T20:43:23+00:00,https://sfist.com/2024/01/16/elon-musk-wants-more-compensation-out-of-tesla-to-move-toward-ai/,"Elon Musk is in some sort of negotiation with the board of Tesla to regain greater voting control at the board level, and he's making this publicly known in a series of tweets, for some reason. In response to some online chatter on Xitter about Musk seeking a new compensation package at Tesla, Musk himself tweeted an explanation on Monday, saying that he wants at least a 25% stake in Tesla going forward, in order to have a larger say in big decisions. The bros on Xitter who like to chatter about things like Elon's compensation were wondering, rightly, why Musk's $100 billion stake in Tesla isn't big enough — does he need to be a trillionaire before he's happy? And Musk decided to explain himself, maybe just to make it known that it's not the money he's after, it's the control. ""I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control,"" Musk's Monday tweet-reply said. ""Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can’t be overturned. Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla."" Musk went on to elaborate saying, ""You don’t seem to understand that Tesla is not one startup, but a dozen. Simply look at the delta between what Tesla does and GM."" And, he says, ""As for stock ownership itself being enough motivation, Fidelity and other own similar stakes to me. Why don’t they show up for work?"" I should note that the Tesla board is great. The reason for no new “compensation plan” is that we are still waiting for a decision in my Delaware compensation case. The trial for that was held in 2022, but a verdict has yet to be made. I put “compensation plan” in quotes,… Musk makes clear that the ""Tesla board is great,"" and he further explains, ""If I have 25%, it means I am influential, but can be overridden if twice as many shareholders vote against me vs for me. At 15% or lower, the for/against ratio to override me makes a takeover by dubious interests too easy."" This seems to reflect some regret on Musk's part. At one point two years ago, Musk had more than a 20% stake in Tesla, as CNN notes, but he sold off a bunch of shares in order to fund his purchase of Twitter, reducing his stake to 13%. In December 2022, after owning Twitter for two months, Musk sold another $3.6 billion in Tesla stock, apparently to help prop up Twitter, as Forbes reported.  Musk's moves in 2022 to take Twitter private, and the amount of air time online that the whole debacle took up, appeared to have a direct impact on Tesla's stock value — and shareholders at the time appeared to be readying to revolt. Tesla shareholders did end up suing in Delaware Chancery Court last year about Musk's compensation package, which was set at $56 billion in stock in 2018, and a resolution in that lawsuit is what is holding up any new compensation negotiations, Musk said in his tweet.  The latest talk about compensation, and this apparent threat to take his talents elsewhere, comes as Tesla expands from a car and battery com...",-2
Elon Musk Demands to Double His Tesla Ownership As the EV Maker Forays Into A.I.,2024-01-16T20:29:06+00:00,https://observer.com/2024/01/elon-musk-seek-25-percent-tesla-ownership/,"Elon Musk’s ownership in Tesla (TSLA) has declined in recent year as a result of him selling Tesla shares to pay hefty tax bills and fund his side hustles, including the $44 billion purchase of Twitter in 2022. But as Tesla has conquered the electric vehicle market and moves into its next chapter of developing artificial intelligence and robotic products, Musk wants to boost his stake in the company so that he has a bigger say in major decisions.

In a string of posts on X yesterday (Jan. 15), Musk said he would like to own a quarter of Tesla, which will be roughly twice what he has today. “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in A.I.  and robotics without having ~25 percent voting control,” Musk wrote, adding that, “unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” Musk has two companies outside of Tesla that are working on A.I. and robotics products: Neuralink, which is developing a robotic surgeon that could one day implant a chip in the human brain, and xAI, which is building a ChatGPT-like A.I. chatbot. Musk currently owns 13 percent of Tesla, which makes up about half of his net worth, according to Bloomberg’s calculation. His ownership in stake in the increasingly valuable SpaceX accounts for a quarter of his wealth, and the rest is spread across X (formerly Twitter), The Boring Company and his other ventures. Just a little more than two years ago, Musk owned more than 20 percent of Tesla. He had to sell a nearly $20 billion stake in late 2021 to cover a tax bill incurred from a set of expiring stock options. The quickest way to boost Musk’s Tesla ownership is for the company’s board to approve a special compensation plan for the CEO similar to the one they signed off in 2018. But the 2018 package, which is estimated to be worth $56 billion, is still under review at a Delaware court as a Tesla shareholder sued the company for unfairly enriching its CEO. “If I have 25 percent, it means I am influential, but can be overridden if twice as many shareholders vote against me vs for me,” Musk explained in another X post yesterday. “At 15 percent or lower, the for/against ratio to override me makes a takeover by dubious interests too easy.” Musk, who is already the world’s richest person, said his demand is not so much about money as it is about voting power. One potential way to increase his voting power without owning more Tesla shares would be implementing a dual-class voting structure, where holders of a special class of shares have superior voting rights to others. But Musk said he’d been told a dual-class structure is impossible for Tesla now that it’s already a publicly traded com...",2
'Tesla isn't very good at explaining some things': Expert says there's a simple hack to charging your EV battery in the cold,2024-01-17T22:47:36+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/01/17/why-dont-teslas-electric-vehicles-charge-in-cold-chicago-battery-elon-musk/,"For nearly a week, frigid temperatures from Chicago to northern Texas have made life painful for electric-vehicle owners, with reduced driving range and hours of waiting at charging stations. In Oak Brook, Illinois, near Chicago, on Monday, television reporters found Teslas that were running out of juice while in long lines for plugs at a Supercharger station. The temperature hit a low of minus 9 Fahrenheit (-23 Celsius). Outside of Ann Arbor, Michigan, Teslas were plugged in at six of eight charging stations Wednesday as the wind howled with a temperature of 7 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 14 Celsius). At least one driver was nearly out of juice. It’s well known that EVs lose some of their travel range in the cold, especially in subzero temperatures like those that hit the nation’s mid-section this week. Studies found that range loss varies from 10% to 36%. EVs also don’t charge as quickly in extreme cold. Some Tesla owners near Chicago told reporters their cars wouldn’t charge at all. Experts acknowledge that cold weather can be hard for EVs, but they say with some planning and a little adjustment, owners should be able to travel pretty much as normal. Inside EV batteries, lithium ions flow through a liquid electrolyte, producing electricity. But they travel more slowly through the electrolyte when it gets cold and don’t release as much energy. That cuts into the range and can deplete a battery faster. The same happens in reverse. Since electrons move more slowly, the battery can’t accept as much electricity from a charging plug. That slows down charging. The problem is that when temperatures plunge, batteries have to be warm enough for the electrons to move. And they have to be even warmer at fast-charging stations like Tesla’s. “Pretty much anything that’s a chemical substance slows down when you get to a low temperature,” said Neil Dasgupta, associate professor of mechanical and materials science engineering at the University of Michigan. “That’s just something that nature has given us, and we have to deal with that.” At a Supercharger station in Pittsfield Township, Michigan, just south of Ann Arbor, the battery in Ankita Bansal’s Tesla had only 7% of its charge left. She plugged in, but the car wouldn’t take electricity. Instead, the display said the battery was heating up. After it hits the proper temperature, it would take an hour and 50 minutes to get to a full charge, the display said. “I have a long way to go,” said Bansal, a University of Michigan graduate student who wanted to get to a full charge because she doesn’t have a charging station at home. Bruce Westlake, president of the Eastern Michigan Electric Vehicle Association, said most EVs are programmed to warm the battery if the driver tells vehicle’s navigation system that a trip to the charging station is coming. Many of those who think their cars won’t charge are new to EVs and don’t know how to “precondition” their batteries, said Westlake, who has two Teslas. “They’re just lear...",-2

Musk wants control of Tesla,2024-01-17T22:06:06+00:00,https://www.herald.co.zw/musk-wants-control-of-tesla/,"s California. — Elon Musk has said he wants a bigger stake in Tesla, reviving debate over the size of the billionaire’s pay package. Mr Musk sold a large chunk of his shares in the electric car company less than two years ago to buy the social media platform Twitter, now called X. He now owns around 13 percent of Tesla. But he claims the current structure makes Tesla vulnerable to a “takeover by dubious interests” and he wants more control over its direction. Mr Musk said he is particularly concerned about Tesla’s investments in artificial intelligence (AI) features. “I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics without having 25 percent voting control,” he wrote in an X post. He added: “Unless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said the comments had created a “firestorm” for Tesla which has presented self-driving and automated capabilities as key to its future. “If Musk ultimately went down the path to create his own company (separate from Tesla) for his next generation AI projects this would clearly be a big negative for the Tesla story,” he wrote. Mr Ives said he expected the board to be able to resolve the issue, but that in the meantime the comments would generate “drama”. “We also believe Musk having a back and forth about such an important issue over X is far from ideal for the investment community,” he added. Shares in Tesla opened more than 2 percent lower following the comments but ended the day flat. Mr Musk, whose rank as world’s wealthiest person is tied to his Tesla shares, said that the board of the firm was “great”. He said the firm was waiting for a court decision in the pending pay deal lawsuit to present a new compensation package. Shareholder Richard Tornetta is taking legal action over a 10-year pay package that the board granted Mr Musk in 2018, which was worth about $55bn with much of it coming from share awards. The package won approval from more than 70 percent of Tesla shareholders but the lawsuit argued that many of those shares belonged to people closely tied to Mr Musk. Shareholder advisory groups had argued against the plan as overly-generous. — BBC.

"Vanredno sletanje: Airbus A330 na letu od Delhija do Ciriha prekinuo let u Beogradu, nastavio posle dva sata",2024-01-18T19:45:50+00:00,https://aero.telegraf.rs/aerodromi/3820027-vanredno-sletanje-airbus-a330-na-letu-od-delhija-do-ciriha-prekinuo-let-u-beogradu-nastavio-posle-dva-sata,"Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. Beogradski aerodrom Nikola Tesla (BEG) imao je u ponedeljak 15. januara neočekivanog posetioca: avion Airbus A330-300 švajcarske kompanije SWISS Air Lines (LX) na letu LX147 sve sa putnicima koji su putovali iz Delhija (DEL) za Cirih (ZRH) neplanirano se prizemljio - u Beograd. Ni kvar na letilici, ni hitan medicinski slučaj, niti dojava o podmetnutoj bombi nisu bili razlog za ovo vanredno sletanje. LX147 poleteo je na vreme iz Delhija u 01.45 po lokalnom vremenu. Let dug nešto više od 6.000 kilometara se odvijao potpuno uobičajeno, po planirajoj ruti, preko vazdušnog prostora Pakistana, Irana, Turske i Bugarske. Ni u jednom trenutku nije bilo ničega što bi ukazivalo na probleme, što je moguće videti na osnovu javno dostupnih podataka na platformi Flightradar24. U trenutku kada je avion leteo iz Bugarske prema Srbiji, iznad Sofije, počelo je spuštanje aviona ka Beogradu koje je trajalo petnaestak minuta, pa se ne može govoriti ni o naglom spuštanju (npr. u slučaju pada pritiska u kabini), niti o gubitku visine usled problema sa vazduhoplovom. Avion je rutinski sleteo ILS prilazom iz pravca Zagreba na pistu 12R. Prema radarskom zapisu, Airbus A330 je bio parkiran na B platformi aerodroma, što ide u prilog tvrdnji da razlog sletanja nije dojava o bombi. Uobičajena procedura - što nalažu i zakoni i propisi - je da se u tom slučaju vazduhoplov smesti na što udaljenijoj intersekciji - daleko od svih objekata u kojima bi usled eksplozije moglo doći do gubitka ljudskih života ili oštećenja dok se ne izvrši kontradiverzioni pregled. Zapravo, razlog za ""prinudno"" sletanje bio je mnogo jednostavniji i iz ugla putnika možda i banalan, ali veoma validan i utemeljen u strogim pravilima vazdušnog saobraćaja: Pilotima je isteklo zakonom propisano radno vreme.  Ovo je informacija koju je Aero.rs dobio direktno sa aerodroma Beograd, od nadležnih službi. ""Avion je sleteo zbog kompanijskih procedura, kapetanu je isteklo radno vreme"", kažu na Aerodromu Nikola Tesla. Airbus A330 poleteo je iz Beograda 15. januara u 10:06 ka Cirihu. Predpostavka je da je do tada u Beograd stigao drugi kapetan koji je preuzeo neplanirani ""leg"" iz Beograda do Ciriha.

The reasons why Elon Musk’s Teslas crash more than gas-powered cars,2024-01-18T17:19:19+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/01/18/business/the-reason-why-elon-musks-teslas-crash-more-than-gas-powered-cars/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Drivers of gas-powered cars are more likely to get into an accident when they switch to an electric vehicle — because they may not be used to the quirks of getting behind the wheel of battery-powered models, according to a report from an insurance industry expert. Data insights firm  LexisNexis Risk Solutions found that the frequency of insurance claims rose 14.3% while the amount paid out increased 14.5% for those who switched to EVs like a Tesla — which makes up the majority of electric vehicle sales in the US.  The data supports Hertz’s recent move to sell off about 20,000 EVs — about 80% of which were Teslas — because of the high costs associated with repairing the fleet. The uptick in insurance claims is the highest during the first year after drivers make the switch to an EV, per LexisNexis’ findings, which were first reported by CNN Business. LexisNexis analyzed insurance claims for new EVs that replaced gas-powered vehicles in American households, CNN reported.  It found that though crashes were common in the first year of switching from battery to gas, accidents surged in households with both a gas and an electric model — indicating that regularly switching from one to another compounds the issue. In addition, the fact that crash frequency lessens with time also suggests that unfamiliarity has something to do with it, Xiaohui Lu, head of EV research at LexisNexis, told CNN. Though LexisNexis didn’t point to a specific EV feature that causes a crash, there are some key differences between a Tesla and the typical gas-powered vehicle. Teslas, for example, turn on and are ready to drive as soon as a person sits in the drivers seat.  Similarly, when the driver gets out, the high-tech vehicle turns itself off. And since the cars are fully electric, there’s no engine rev or vibration when a Tesla turns on, making it difficult to discern whether the vehicle is ready to drive or not. Also, Teslas can accelerate at a much faster rate than their gas-powered counterparts, Lu told the outlet. Tesla’s Model 3, for example, can reportedly go from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.1 seconds.  The BMW 330i, by comparison, takes more than a second longer to reach that speed. However, high speeds aren’t the only concern for Lu, who also pointed to EVs’ quick response to pedal pressure as an issue, according to CNN. Gas cars starting from a stop generally need more pedal pressure before the car can start moving, as the engine needs to rev a bit, which isn’t the case with an EV, per CNN. This difference can be dangerous in environments where low speeds are critical, such as in parking garages or lots, or in a traffic jam. “Most drivers are trained in driving [internal combustion] vehicles and they’re applying the habitual amount of pressure on the driving pedal but the behavior is very different, particularly in low-speed zones,” Lu told the outlet. It could also be difficult for drivers to get used ...",-2

 Isn't this the same group calling Chinese batteries a security threat also the same group of people that wanted to give China the ""Most Favored Nation"" status in the mid-90s? The reason the military wants to only use only US-based suppliers whenever possible is because during an actual conflict, a foreign supply could be instantly cut off.  It's security in the sense that their logistics operations will still function in wartime, not security in the sense that the Chinese might be spying on them. Isn't this the same group calling Chinese batteries a security threat also the same group of people that wanted to give China the ""Most Favored Nation"" status in the mid-90s?Yes and? The only stupid thing to do would be to not change your mind given updated information in this ever dynamic world. China was deserving of its Most Favoured Nation title in the 90s.

Better than Panasonic, better than the Korean manufacturers, better than everyone. What's more, they are very attractively priced. We either need to accept that we are going to buy a lot of Chinese batteries, or put some serious effort into improving our own battery technology. So the US will only capture the non-military market, which is a micro-fractional part of available capacity. Everything else will have Chinese crap being forcibly capture by order of insane, governmental regulations. Then, down the road, they;ll lobby to remove that restriction... Chinese batteries are very good, actually.  Btu don't let facts get in the way oof your racist jingoism. Giving money to an enemy society is highly questionable.(InB4 ChiCom shillrage.)

Magnetized Black Holes Can Create Superconducting Effect in Raw Vacuum,2024-01-19T22:07:54+00:00,https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2024/01/magnetized-black-holes-can-create-superconducting-effect-in-raw-vacuum.html,"Home » Energy » Magnetized Black Holes Can Create Superconducting Effect in Raw Vacuum Using first-principle lattice simulations, researchers demonstrate that in the background of a strong magnetic field (around 10^20 Tesla – 100 million trillion Tesla aka 100 quintillion), the electroweak sector of the vacuum experiences two consecutive crossover transitions associated with dramatic changes in the zero-temperature dynamics of the vector bosons and the scalar Higgs particles, respectively. Above the first crossover, they observe the appearance of large, inhomogeneous structures consistent with a classical picture of the formation of W and Z condensates pierced by vortices. The presence of the W and Z condensates supports the emergence of the exotic superconducting and superfluid properties induced by a strong magnetic field in the vacuum. They find evidence that the vortices form a disordered solid or a liquid rather than a crystal. The second transition restores the electroweak symmetry. Such conditions can be realized in the near-horizon region of the magnetized black holes.    Brian Wang is a Futurist Thought Leader and a popular Science blogger with 1 million readers per month.

SHARE OF THE WEEK: Elon Musk under pressure to produce a solid set of fourth quarter results at Tesla,2024-01-19T21:50:10+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/investing/article-12984551/SHARE-WEEK-Elon-Musk-pressure-produce-solid-set-fourth-quarter-results-Tesla.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By City & Finance Reporter   Updated:  21:50, 19 January 2024      View  comments  Elon Musk is under pressure to produce a solid set of fourth quarter results at Tesla next week after an iffy start to the year. Shares in the electric car giant – one of the so-called Magnificent Seven alongside Apple, Microsoft, Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia and Facebook-parent Meta – doubled last year. But they are down around 15 per cent this year and are worth just half what they were at their peak in late 2021. In a further blow, Tesla is no longer the biggest maker of electric cars in the world, having been overtaken by Chinese rival BYD amid a vicious price war to boost sales.  So investors will be hoping Musk – whose eccentric behaviour continues to raise eyebrows amid allegations of drug abuse, which he denies – can deliver the goods on Wednesday night. Failure to do so may spark fresh talk about the future of his sprawling business empire which also includes X, formerly known as Twitter, and Space X. 'Tesla has been disappointing investors as questions are raised over profitability amid an EV [electric vehicle] price war,' said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown. But she added: 'It's important to stress that Tesla has an excellent product. If production can be ramped up at pace, the horizon looks promising.' Analysts are expecting quarterly revenues of around £20billion, and there will be much interest on how this translates into profits given the price cuts.

Lordstown Motors founder launches new EV startup with trucks we’ve seen before,2024-01-19T21:41:42+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/19/lordstown-motors-steve-burns-landx-motors-endurance-pickup/,"The ousted founder of bankrupt EV startup Lordstown Motors has launched a new company called LandX Motors, that prominently displays the same electric pickup truck he once promised would beat Tesla, Ford and General Motors to market. Steve Burns, a self-described “serial entrepreneur,” bought most of the remaining assets of his former startup late last year as part of the Lordstown’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, including a large chunk of its electric pickup trucks. On a new website for LandX Motors, he says this company will chart “the future of mobility,” and claims he will build a whole lineup of vehicles on the platform that underpins what used to be called the Endurance. While LandX Motors doesn’t explicitly refer to the trucks as the Endurance, a video on the website shows EV trucks that have the Lordstown badge. A person familiar with the company’s plans told TechCrunch that it’s not so much about the Endurance truck, but the underlying platform, software and engineering behind it. Still, with the former Lordstown trucks playing a starring role on company’s website and video, it’s unclear just how developed this plan is. What’s not made clear on the website is how Burns plans to crack some of the biggest problems that Lordstown Motors never solved. Crucially, Lordstown Motors executives said in the months before filing for bankruptcy protection that the cost to build the Endurance far exceeded the $60,000 retail price. The company also doesn’t say where, or how, it plans to build the trucks. A LandX Motors spokesperson responded to an email, but didn’t provide any further information and declined to answer questions. This isn’t the first time that Burns has started a new electric vehicle company with ties to an old one. He founded Lordstown Motors in 2019 after leaving a different struggling EV startup, Workhorse. He struck a deal with that company to license the designs for a pickup truck project that became the Endurance. He then purchased a shuttered GM factory in Lordstown, Ohio, and took Lordstown Motors public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company in 2020. By early 2021, Lordstown Motors was under federal investigation for misleading investors during the merger process about how many orders it had secured for the Endurance. Burns and then-chief financial officer Julio Rodriguez resigned after the company’s own internal probe determined that they had, in fact, made misleading statements. The startup struggled and ultimately sold the factory to iPhone maker Foxconn. The Taiwanese electronics giant started building Endurance trucks in late 2022, but they were quickly recalled, and the two companies had a falling out. Lordstown filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2023. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently said in court filings that it is seeking $45 million from the company for “violations of federal securities laws.” Burns made tens of millions of dollars selling Lordstown stock during all of this. ...",0

Tesla Unboxed Process Will Reduce Costs by 30%,2024-01-20T05:42:02+00:00,https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2024/01/tesla-unboxed-process-will-reduce-costs-by-30.html,"Home » Energy » Tesla Unboxed Process Will Reduce Costs by 30% Caresoft, a company similar in some ways to Munro Associates, tear down vehicles in order to reverse engineer and perform cost analysis. The CEO of Caresoft analyzed the legacy assembly line, the Tesla model Y assembly line and the Tesla next generation line. Tesla unboxed parallel modular manufacturing process will reduce costs by over 30% from the leading Tesla Model Y process. Tesla is the top benchmarked company. Chinese companies only benchmark themselves and Tesla. The Chinese car makers are not benchmarking Toyota anymore. Chinese consumers want a new car which visibly looks different than it did three years ago. They want to say they have arrived with a new car. Tesla needs to put cosmetic changes so that people know that the buyer has a new car. Chinese carmakers are looking at the Caresoft analysis of the unboxed process and there are at least two who are looking to copy the unboxed process.

Does this mean that *just* with the unboxing process the AWD Y price might possibly drop 30% to under $36,000? With tax credit, $29,000 equivalent? And if Tesla continues to drop battery costs, even less than that?!? If those are true, the idea of a sub $25,000 or even sub $20,000 EV no longer sounds like a pipe dream.
It also sounds like the end of ICE vehicle domination, for starters. What is stopping the big auto manufacturers (ahem, China) from doing this? Or any other manufacturing concern? And what will it mean for us factory workers? Factory worker?
I’ve been trying to contract multiple politicians and now unions to get them to pass new laws/INC setups to allow, in fact encourage, unions to own and create their own businesses. You would still be employed by same company, but ideally the unions would setup automated lines to make the parts that your employer now imports. Likewise, this would hopefully encourage you to have your employer to automate more, I.e. reduce union jobs with more local automation , but buy the parts from you. With this approach, you and your employer would own

ALERT!

Tesla Full Self-Driving (Beta) V12.1.2 Customer Deployment Started Tesla has been testing Full Self-driving Beta V12.X with 50,000 employees for a few weeks but has now begun staged rollout for Tesla FSD buyers with HW4. Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) v12 is a milestone in autonomous driving technology. It uses end-to-end neural networks, which are AI networks that can be used for everything from vehicle input to output. These new networks can replace more than 300,000 lines of explicit code. Elon Musk said that FSD v12 would remove the beta designation. IF this happens at the end of the staged deployment, then Tesla would be able to recognize about $2 billion in deferred revenue. There may be a need one more upgrade needed to adjust for the overfit to California. There could also be a few months to train the European and Chinese versions of V12.X. We're pleased to share that Full Self-Driving (Beta) v12.1.2 is now going out to *some* customers and includes vehicles with HW4 for the first time. https://t.co/xCId81Bu31 — Teslascope (@teslascope) January 21, 2024    Tesla would ultimately deploy V12.1 to Wave1 employees on December 27th, over a week earlier than expected. This was substantially faster than the rollout of V11, which first went out to the specialized group on November 11th and wouldn’t be received by Wave1 until March 7th the following year. A difference of almost three months. 3️⃣ V12.1 Feedback Since the initial release of V12.1 to Wave1, we’ve received at least a dozen reviews and feedback from employees, which we’ve summarized below: 72% expressed improvements in “human-like behavior” and general stability, 20% noted no change, 8% noted some worsened experiences. ~40% expressed improvements with roundabouts, ~50% noted no change, ~10% noted some worsened experiences. 37% expressed improvements in lane-keeping, 60% noted no change, 3% noted some worsened experiences. For transparency purposes, all employees included in the results above reside in California. 4️⃣ Our Outlook and Possible Delays With the initial goal of expansion to Wave1 met, the 3.5x rate improvement in progress compared to V11, and daily testing of cutting-edge Full Self-Driving (Beta) V12 builds with ADAS roles, we’re remaining hopeful for the release of V12 in late January [Nextbigfuture notes that this is happening now]. . With the release of the Cybertruck, some energy has been redirected towards finalizing a stable build of FSDb for these vehicles, which may cause some unexpected delays. We are also monitoring continued rollouts to additional vehicles within Wave1 and additional regions within the United States and Canada. To summarize: Tesla’s rapid rate of improvements and progress since V11 leans towards our projection of an initial release of V12 to customers this month, with a very likely chance of Actually Smart Summon (ASS) slipping into the later end of Q1. Let's discuss Full Self-Driving (Beta) V12, where it ...",2

"As Tesla-beating BYD and other Chinese EV makers rise, German auto suppliers struggle: ‘Who is the winner and who is the loser is changing’",2024-01-21T18:01:17+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/01/21/tesla-beating-byd-chinese-ev-makers-german-auto-suppliers/,"China’s BYD, which recently passed Tesla in global sales of electric vehicles, is exporting its cars around the world, from Indonesia to Mexico to England. As it and other Chinese EV makers expand, a once-comfortable sector of the automotive world is feeling increasingly on edge: German auto suppliers.  For decades, German suppliers—among them Schaeffler, Continental, and ZF Friedrichshafen—confidently thrived alongside the nation’s automotive powerhouses, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. But the transition to electric vehicles suggests they can no longer rely on their old advantages.  “Who is the winner and who is the loser is changing,” Christian Kames, co-head of investment banking at Lazard for Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, told the Financial Times. He noted the higher margins enjoyed by newer suppliers, many based in Asia, who focus on batteries, software, and semiconductors. German suppliers—already contending with inflation and rising interest rates amid Germany’s economic downturn—need to invest in EVs while also keeping their market position with traditional cars. That has them “double spending on double platforms—everything is double, except for growth or profit,” said Kames.  Amid these difficulties, Schaeffler launched a bid in October to buy its rival Vitesco Technologies, which became an outlier among big German suppliers by making an early bet on EVs. While few in the industry believed Vitesco’s gamble made sense five years ago, today the company is an attractive takeover target because of it. Meanwhile China’s rising automakers tend to rely on Chinese suppliers. German suppliers do brisk trade in China, but their main customers are the big German automakers. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently praised Chinese automakers and suggested they will emerge as dominant players in the global automotive industry—a sharp departure from when he laughed about the quality of BYD cars in 2011. Last year, an Allianz Trade report stated that China’s EV makers pose a significant threat to European carmakers, particularly the “automotive-dependent economies of Germany, Slovakia and Czech Republic.” It called for higher tariffs on Chinese EVs, estimating that by 2030 they could cost Europe’s carmakers 7 billion euros per year in lost profits.  In the weeks ahead, EU investigators will visit Chinese EV makers BYD, Geely, and SAIC as part of an investigation into whether they have an unfair advantage thanks to government subsidies. Their visits—part of an EU probe announced in September—will help determine whether the EU imposes higher tariffs to protect its carmakers.  Read more: With Germany in recession and Detroit reeling over ultra-cheap Chinese EVs, Beijing vows to crack down on ‘blind’ construction of new EV projects But either way, German auto suppliers face a changing world.

Tesla recalls over 4K vehicles due to software issue,2024-01-21T17:33:24+00:00,https://www.zeebiz.com/automobile/news-tesla-recalls-over-4k-vehicles-due-to-software-issue-273015,"Elon Musk-run Tesla has recalled more than 4,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles made between 2022 and 2023 in Australia due to a software issue. According to the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts (DITRCA), the software issue in 4,382 vehicles could make the steering wheel difficult to use when driving in cold temperatures. ""Due to a software issue, the steering wheel may feel notchy when operating the vehicle in cold temperatures,"" the notice reads. However, the notice stated that, despite the malfunction, drivers are not at risk of serious injury while operating the vehicles. “The defect will not affect the performance of the vehicle,” it noted. Owners of affected vehicles are asked to contact Tesla to make an appointment to have the vehicle software version inspected and updated to version 2023.38 or later, free of charge, or update their vehicle's software as they usually do using the main screen, according to the notice. Earlier this month, Tesla recalled 1.6 million vehicles in China, its largest-ever recall in the country, to fix its autopilot system. The recall in China was to fix issues with Tesla’s driver-assistance features that could increase the risk of crashes, reports the Wall Street Journal. The automaker had recalled two million cars in the US last year due to the same issue.

The idea was to promote the company’s electric vehicle rentals with Brady being featured in a marketing campaign called “Hertz Let’s Go!” But fast forward to 2024, the whole Hertz rental thing is about to dissolve.  Recently, Hertz has come up with the proposition that it would be selling 20,000 EVs so they can focus more on gas-powered cars. For a leading company to decide this, there must be a serious underlying reason for it. And the reason has something to do with the cost and maintenance issues of rental EVs.   ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad In what is a drastic blow to EV rental users, Hertz has officially announced its decision to set 20,000 EVs in the market. In the past, Tom Brady, who was an actual Hertz customer, ran the Hertz EV campaign in a video where he was seen recharging at a Hertz location. The deal which was to remain active through 2024 suddenly saw a U-turn on Thursday.  April 12, 2024 08:27 PM EDT April 12, 2024 09:10 PM EDT April 12, 2024 12:15 PM EDT November 20, 2023 04:39 AM EST April 12, 2024 08:55 PM EDT Get instantly notified of the hottest NFL stories via Google!

Hertz stated, “The company expects this action to better balance supply against expected demand of EVs. This will position the company to eliminate a disproportionate number of lower margin rentals and reduce damage expense associated with EVs.” The 20,000 EVs are expected to sell out by 2025.  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad Hertz’s recent verdict to dump rental EVs could spell trouble for people who own electric cars.

Elon Musk toured Auschwitz with Ben Shapiro,2024-01-22T20:53:54+00:00,https://www.deseret.com/faith/2024/1/22/24046996/elon-musk-visiting-auschwitz,"Tech titan Elon Musk visited the site of a former concentration camp Monday as he continues to fight accusations of antisemitism. Musk, who runs SpaceX and Tesla and owns X, the site formerly known as Twitter, has recently lost key advertisers on the social media site due to his own statements about the Jewish community and his apparent tolerance of antisemitic comments from others, according to The Associated Press.   “Several big brands, including Disney and IBM, stopped advertising on (X) last year after liberal advocacy group Media Matters said that their ads were appearing alongside pro-Nazi content and white nationalist posts. X has since sued Media Matters,” the article said.  Musk has repeatedly pushed back against claims that he’s antisemitic or that he allows antisemitism to flourish on X, as the Deseret News previously reported.  In September, he tweeted that he’s against antisemitism but in favor of free speech.  Later that same month, Musk met with Benjamin Netanyahu during the Israeli prime minister’s visit to California.  On Monday, Musk toured the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camp in Oswiecim, Poland, with podcaster Ben Shapiro before both men attended a conference on antisemitism in Krakow, per The Associated Press.  The former concentration camp, which is better known as Auschwitz, was “the principal” camp used by Nazi Germany in its mission to imprison and kill Jews, according to UNESCO, which now considers Auschwitz-Birkenau to be a world heritage site.  “According to historical investigations, 1.5 million people, among them a great number of Jews, were systematically starved, tortured and murdered in this camp,” UNESCO reports.  Today, most of the remains of the Auschwitz camp are open to visitors. Among other things, visitors can see the bunks where prisoners slept and the bathrooms they used, the Auschwitz-Birkenau website explains.  Musk and Shapiro took part in a private tour and had the opportunity to meet with a Holocaust survivor, according to The Associated Press.  On X, Musk reposted a picture of himself on the tour, as well as a video clip from his appearance at the antisemitism conference. ",-2

		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 The the manual for Tesla’s newly unveiled Cybertruck advises that owners to remove bird poop, tree sap and dead insects from the futuristic vehicle in order to prevent damage to its stainless steel body. “To prevent damage to the exterior, immediately remove corrosive substances (such as grease, oil, bird droppings, tree resin, dead insects, tar spots, road salt, industrial fallout, etc.),” the owner’s manual of the new Cybertruck reads:  The manual also urges Cybertruck owners not to wait for a complete wash. “If necessary, use denatured alcohol to remove tar spots and stubborn grease stains, then immediately wash the area with water and a mild, non-detergent soap to remove the alcohol,” the manual states. A Cybertruck owner posted the text of the manual onto his X social media page.  The post was reported by MotorBiscuit. Cybertruck exterior will corrode and Tesla readily admits this in the manual. It's what I've been saying all along. Once that oxide barrier is compromised – corrosion begins."".. immediately remove corrosive substances… Do not wait until Cybertruck is due for a complete wash."" pic.twitter.com/soKbxYfJsM During wintertime, cars are exposed to road salt. In the summer, it is usually bird droppings and tree sap. Vehicles are also forced to weather year-round problems such as tar and grease from the roads. All of these substances are considered corrosive and thus require immediately care, according to the manual. “Wait, what? …Immediately wash off bird poop, dead insects and tree resin? Is this a badass Cybertruck or a f–king cream puff?” one X user wrote. Others noted that the owner’s manual for other Tesla vehicles including for the Model 3 say the same thing. “True for every car,” wrote another X user. “Move on.” Tesla made the controversial decision to not paint the Cybertruck and offer it with just its stainless steel exterior, which company CEO Elon Musk wanted so as to project an image of a “tough” vehicle. In late November, Tesla delivered its first batch of Cybertrucks two years behind the original schedule. Musk has said the Cybertruck’s body is made of a stainless steel alloy developed by Tesla.  The body panels had to be angular because they can’t be stamped by a conventional press, he said. Stainless steel, he said, has no corrosion and doesn’t need paint, but can still be mass produced. When Musk unveiled the truck four years ago, he said production would start in 2021. But on the company’s earnings conference call in October, Musk lamented how hard it has been to produce the innovative truck with a body made of hard-to-bend stainless steel. “We dug our own grave with Cybertruck,” said Musk, who added that he didn’t think the company would reach its production target of 250,000 per year until 2025. The initial rollout has come with kinks. Earlier his month, a YouTuber took Tesla’s Cybertruck on a rid...",-2

BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT Teslas can seemingly spot ghosts as well as other driving hazards, after mysterious human figures were captured by one owner in a cemetery during a late-night outing. The unnamed man was driving through a graveyard in Burrillville, Rhode Island, the US, when figures began to appear on the vehicle’s control screen. He was accompanied by his fiancé and brother, who can be heard screaming as the figures multiply on the screen. Yet funnily enough, just mere seconds before, other people were captured on video walking through the graveyard. And after the mysterious grey figures began to appear, the camera never panned back to the graveyard to prove there was no one there. The man, who says he is a Tesla employee, said: ‘[I can] confirm this is not an Easter Egg [that] Elon added, I’ve tried this many times. It’s not just picking up the gravestones as even if it was they would show as stationary on the screen.’ Tesla is known for its hardware ‘Easter Eggs’, which are fun unexpected features embedded into its system to make the experience of driving a Tesla more up Elon Musk’s street.

However, rather than Mr Musk’s invention doubling up as a ghost detector, this glitch was attributed to a flaw in the vehicle’s collision avoidance system. However, the latest video’s human-shaped objects could be perhaps attributed to actual humans in the graveyard. Or ghosts. But probably not.

China seems to have backtracked on strict rules to combat what the regulator deemed “obsessive” gaming. The National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) had proposed regulations limiting the amount of money and time people spent playing video games. However, on Tuesday the draft rules were no longer on the NPPA website. China is the world’s biggest online gaming market, but the industry has had frequent run-ins with the authorities. The new rules would have limited in-game purchases. BBC One of the world’s most popular YouTubers has revealed that he made over £200,000 in ad revenue by posting a video on X. MrBeast is renowned for creating expensive videos, including competitions where contestants battle it out to win huge cash prizes. While he has more than 233 million subscribers on YouTube, the influencer said he was curious to see how profitable it would be to post on Elon Musk’s platform. Sky News  The recent Arctic blasts across the United States left some electric vehicle (EV) owners in a jam. Fast-draining batteries, slow charging, long queues, and cars being towed after running out of power were reported from Illinois and Michigan to Texas. Sub-zero temperatures aren’t great for EV battery life – neither, of course, are they for gasoline-powered cars which more frequently break down in freezing conditions. New research from a Norwegian breakdown service revealed that electric cars fail less in extreme cold than fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Independent Hot on the heels of the world’s largest technology show, CES 2024, we’ve already been treated to a host of brand new tellies due out in 2024. But beyond the best new OLED panels – such as the LG OLED G4, and wireless LG OLED M4 – there’s suddenly a surprise post-show announcement that looks set to bring a world-first OLED panel to market. I’m talking about the Philips OLED 959 all-new flagship (with integrated soundsystem) and Philips OLED 909, both of which embody an OLED panel that’s said to push as bright as 3000 nits (about 30% brighter than other best-in-class recent reveals, such as the Panasonic Z95A). T3.com Used and refurbished smartphones sales continue to expand by near-double digits but that rate is slowing as elongated refresh cycles for brand new handsets means fewer secondhand devices are becoming available.

		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 The value of an average used Tesla has toppled more than $1,500 so far this month, according to a new report. On Jan. 1, a used Tesla retailed for $37,090, according to data from auto-shopping website CarGurus. Just 20 days later, as of Jan. 21, the standard used Tesla runs for $35,554, marking a $1,536 decrease so far this month. For reference, during the same period, CarGurus’ used car index — which takes into account mean average sales price by mileage and market class for an array of gas- and battery-powered vehicles — fell just $377. The Elon Musk-run EV-manufacturer has had a rough start to 2024, as its share price has also seen a downward trend: Year-to-date, Tesla’s share price has dipped nearly 16%, to $208.80. Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. As Tesla has increasingly lost market share to EV-rival BYD — the Chinese EV-maker that dethroned Tesla as the top electric auto-manufacturer in the latest quarter — it has also lost business at car-rental giants like Hertz and SIXT. Hertz announced earlier this year that it’s scrapping about 2,000 of its EVs — about 80% of which were Teslas, citing high costs associated with repairing the fleet. As of last week, Hertz was already offering Tesla Model 3s on its website for as little as $18,000. The rate marks a nearly 50% discount from the $35,000 price tag the Model 3 boasts on Tesla’s website — another indication of how much the Austin-based manufacturer’s cars depreciate in value. Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr even mentioned the declining value of EVs during a call with investors in October. “The MSRP [manufacturer’s suggested retail price] declines in EVs over the course of 2023, driven primarily by Tesla, have driven the fair market value of our EVs lower as compared to last year, such that a salvage creates a larger loss and, therefore, greater burden,” Scherr said at the time. Separately, SIXT, Europe’s largest car-rental firm, said last month that it was dropping Teslas from its EV offerings. Shorty thereafter, SIXT announced plans to buy as many as 250,000 Stellantis vehicles — which will be a mix of combustion-engine, plug-in hybrid and battery-electric vehicles, including Jeeps, Chryslers and Dodges, among others. A spokesperson for SIXT insisted to The Post last week that its Stellantis order is unrelated to the company’s decision to sell its Teslas. SIXT also attributed its phase-out of Teslas to high repair costs in comparison to their gas-powered counterparts. EVs involved in a crash typically result in a high repair bill because of their complex features, such as safety sensors in bumpers, which may seem like a luxurious perk when driving but is a costly fix even when it has a minor dent. Recent data from insights firm LexisNexis Risk Solutions found that drivers pay out about 14.5% more for insurance claims when they switch from a gas-powered car to an electric one like ...",-3

"‘Train wreck’: Tesla shares plunge, Musk blasted",2024-01-25T22:08:52+00:00,https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/markets/train-wreck-tesla-shares-plunge-after-warnings-20240126-p5f073.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_business,"We’re sorry, this feature is currently unavailable.

Tesla shares plunged after Elon Musk’s pitch for investors to look past slower sales growth fell flat. The stock closed more than 12 per cent lower on Wall Street, wiping around $US80 billion ($121.5 billion) off the value of the company. Tesla narrowly missed earnings estimates and warned its rate of expansion will be “notably lower” this year. The company spent all of 2023 cutting prices to boost sales, which ate into profits. Elon Musk fears that Chinese car companies will “demolish” their rivals unless they are hit with tariffs.Credit: AP The effectiveness of that strategy is waning, and executives cautioned they’re approaching the limits of efforts to cut costs on the current vehicle lineup. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives scolded the company and Musk in a note to investors after the company’s call. “We were dead wrong expecting Musk and team to step up like adults in the room on the call and give a strategic and financial overview of the ongoing price cuts, margin structure, and fluctuating demand....instead we got a high-level Tesla long-term view with another train wreck conference call.” Tesla faces stiff competition in the form of Chinese EV makers, which Musk said are “the most competitive car companies in the world.” Chinese brands probably will succeed exporting abroad, he said, unless tariffs or other trade barriers are implemented to halt their advance. The CEO has witnessed the threat firsthand, with BYD overtaking Tesla as the world’s top seller of EVs in the quarter. “Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world,” Musk said of China’s automakers. Tesla shares are having their worst start ever to a year. Thursday’s slump was the steepest intraday drop in three months, and the stock is now trading at its lowest level since last May. Elsewhere on Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed 0.5 per cent higher for a fifth straight day of gains. The Dow Jones added 0.6 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite finished 0.2 per cent higher. The Australian sharemarket is closed on Friday for the Australia Day public holiday. It added 0.5 per cent on Thursday. IBM led the market with a gain of 9.5 per cent after it reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, helping to offset the effects of Tesla’s dive. It helped offset a 12.1 per cent tumble for Tesla, whose earnings and revenue fell short of forecasts. The electric-vehicle maker also warned of notably lower sales growth this year. Wall Street advanced despite Tesla’s slump. Credit: Bloomberg Wall Street’s main focus was on a report indicating the US economy continues to steam ahead, demolishing last year’s forecasts for an imminent recession because of high interest rates. The economy grew at a 3.3 per cent annual rate...",-3

Tesla to spend $500M to bring its Dojo supercomputer project to Buffalo factory,2024-01-26T22:09:08+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/26/tesla-dojo-supercomputer-buffalo-factory-500-million/,"Tesla will spend $500 million to build one of its so-called “Dojo” supercomputers at its Buffalo, New York factory, the state’s governor Kathy Hochul said Friday during a news conference just days after CEO Elon Musk called the project a “long shot.” Tesla’s decision was “informed by New York’s reliable power supply, strong talent pipeline and availability of usable space for the project,” according to Hochul’s office. Dojo, which was first announced at Tesla’s “AI Day” event in 2021, is a supercomputer meant to help advance the company’s still-unrealized goal of building a self-driving car. Tesla plans to use the supercomputer to process reams of video data that come off of its electric vehicles in order to train the AI that now powers its most advanced driver assistance software, which it calls Full Self-Driving Beta. Musk said last year that Tesla plans to spend “well over $1 billion” on Dojo. Bringing the Dojo project to Buffalo is the latest shift in Tesla’s priorities for the location, which has turned into something of a boondoggle for New York state. Once dubbed “Gigafactory 2,” Tesla took over the factory from SolarCity when it acquired the troubled solar panel company in 2016. The state had already committed $750 million to the plant by that point. Tesla promised to make Solar Roof tiles there, but struggled to produce the product at scale. Its partner, Panasonic, pulled out of the plant in 2020, and Tesla pivoted to employing people who labeled training data for its less-advanced Autopilot software. Musk said last April that he believed the Dojo supercomputer project was a “long shot bet” that could “pay off in a very, very big way… in the multi-hundred-billion-dollar level.” He reiterated the point this week on a call with analysts. “It’s not, like, a sure thing at all, It’s a high-risk, high-payoff program,” he said. “We are scaling it up, and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2, Dojo 3, and whatnot. So, you know, I think it’s got potential, but the kind of size enough high risk, high payoff.” While the $500 million investment received cheers during Hochul’s press conference, Musk downplayed the figure in a social media post on X, noting the company would spend far more money on Nvidia hardware in 2024. “The governor is correct that this is a Dojo Supercomputer, but $500M, while obviously a large sum of money, is only equivalent to a 10k H100 system from Nvidia,” Musk wrote in the post on X. “Tesla will spend more than that on Nvidia hardware this year. The table stakes for being competitive in AI are at least several billion dollars per year at this point.”",2

Tesla Investors See ‘There’s No Floor’ After Losing $200 Billion,2024-01-27T14:49:49+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/after-losing-200-billion-tesla-investors-see-there-s-no-floor,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. investors haven’t had a stretch this bad in a long time.  Shares of Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle giant have dropped 26% this month, wiping out $205 billion in market valuation. They stock is on pace to close lower for the sixth straight week, its longest losing streak since 2016. For perspective, at that point Tesla hadn’t even launched its first mass-market car, the Model 3. “There’s no floor in this stock in the near term,” Adam Sarhan, founder and CEO of 50 Park Investments, said in an interview. “Investors are scratching their heads. If Tesla is lowering its forecast and is not bullish on the near term, why should investors be bullish.” There are plenty of reasons for the selloff. The auto industry is warning about plunging demand for EVs. Hertz Global Holding Inc., the rental-car behemoth, pulled back from plans to expand its electric vehicle fleet, and Ford Motor Co. said it was seeing a weaker market for them.  Meanwhile, Tesla instituted multiple price cuts, sparking worries about thinning margins. Then came Wednesday’s fourth-quarter earnings report, when the company said it expected to expand at a “notably lower” rate in 2024, but did not given any further details. The stock tanked on the news. Bulls Bail Since then, at least two analysts have downgraded the stock, while several have cut their price targets on the stock. The average price target on Tesla has fallen by nearly 8% since Tuesday’s close, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and now sits at $220.34. The shares are trading at around $185. Long-time bullish Tesla analyst, Wedbush’s Daniel Ives, removed the stock from his “Best Ideas List,” saying the lack of details on price cuts, outlook, demand from the company is “a bitter pill to swallow for the bulls.” Ives still has a buy equivalent rating on the stock, but has also lowered his price target.  The stock could stay in flux for a while, considering Tesla’s reluctance to lay out a roadmap and an EV winter that’s expected to plague the entire industry this year.  “Tesla’s December results and outlook effectively pushed back the positive inflection point in the business by a year,” said Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management. “Now it looks to be the second half of 2025 before revenue growth will accelerate. In the near-term, shares will likely drift lower in what will be a vacuum of good news.” Still, for a stock that can move vigorously in either direction once sentiment shifts, this month’s sharp dive also could open the doors to a quick bounce back. Technical signals suggest the stock has dropped into “oversold” territory, which typically signals a coming reversal. The violent drop “in less than one month has taken it to the kind of oversold level that has only been exceeded once since it went public,” Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co., wrote in a note on Friday. “This stock might have further to fall before it reaches its ultimate bottom, but the odds that it will s...",-3

     WorldStrat Corporations Jim Hanson discusses Bidens border fight with Texas on Jesse Watters Primetime. Elon Musk has fired back at President Biden’s calls for a bipartisan Senate deal to be passed to fix the unprecedented levels of illegal immigrants crossing the southern border. Biden released a statement late Friday saying that the legislation being negotiated would give the president a new emergency authority to shut down the border ""when it becomes overwhelmed"" and that he would use that authority on the day he signs the bill into law.         ""For everyone who is demanding tougher border control, this is the way to do it,"" Biden said in the statement.

""No laws need to be passed,"" Musk wrote. ""All that is needed is an executive order to require proof before granting an asylum hearing. That is how it used to be."" Musk, the owner of Tesla, SpaceX and X, previously argued that gaining asylum status after illegally crossing the southern border is as easy as a Google search.  He also agreed with Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor David Sacks who wrote last night that the border is broken ""because this administration refuses to enforce the laws we already have."" Musk responded by writing, ""exactly."" December 2023 saw the highest interactions between border patrol and migrants for a single month in U.S. history. (John Moore/Getty Images) BORDER DEAL PRICE TAG LIKELY TO COST MORE THAN $14 BILLION, BUT GOP LAWMAKERS GROW RESTLESS TO SEE BILL TEXT Sacks also posted a video of hundreds of illegal immigrants descending on the border and describing Biden’s current policy as being ""open borders, to which Musk wrote, ""That is undeniable at this point."" December saw the highest interactions between border patrol and migrants for a single month in U.S. history. Meanwhile, Musk appeared to shift his views on the need for a wall at the southern border, having previously voiced his support for such a structure.  ""Building a wall is a red herring,"" Musk wr...",0

This week, read about how Mercedes mistakenly exposed its source code, the latest in the Cruise-GM saga, Tesla’s EV sales warning and more. Let’s go!  Economic headwinds might be easing a bit, but companies are still getting squeezed. Autonomous vehicle and EV startups — even those that have since gone public — are trying to cut costs in hopes of extending their capital runway. Aurora Innovation, for instance, laid off about 3% of its workforce; EV company Polestar confirmed to TechCrunch it has also cut about 15% of its global workforce; Flexport is reportedly looking to axe another 20% of jobs; and package delivery company Veho said that it laid off 19% of its corporate/exempt employee headcount. Now, a few little birds are telling us that Canoo and Faraday Future — both EV startups that went public via mergers with special purpose acquisition companies — are either reducing salaries or furloughing employees. Faraday has confirmed it has reduced salaries and furloughed employees without providing more detail. Sources tell us that Canoo is also furloughing workers. Got a tip for us?

Over at the TC climate desk, reporter Harri Weber spoke to ArcTern Managing Partner Murray McCaig about its third (and recently closed) $335 million fund. ArcTern plans to pump this capital into climate-focused startups that can deliver super quick returns. Specifically, the Toronto-based firm is focused on startups that use proven tech in new ways. And his bet? Decarbonizing mobility. Though electric vehicle sales have slowed lately, McCaig sees this as a “blip.” The VC believes North America is about to reach a tipping point where EV adoption takes off like a rocket, as it has in Norway.

"Elon, boychik, welcome to the tribe!",2024-01-28T18:19:50+00:00,https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2024/1/28/24053294/elon-musk-jewish-column-steinberg,"Tesla and SpaceX’s CEO Elon Musk visits the site of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi German death camp in Oswiecim, Poland, on Monday, Jan. 22, 2024.  Yoav Dudkevitch, AP Photos Elon, my man! Bagrisn aheym mayn bruder! Welcome home, my brother! Oh sorry, Getting ahead of myself. Last Monday, the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, visited Auschwitz and declared himself “aspirationally Jewish.” As someone who is not aspirationally but actually Jewish, that is a slow pitch right down the pipe. A guy’s gotta swing. Judaism is a great religion. That fact often gets lost, what with all the people hating us and wanting us dead. Great food. Great traditions. Not a lot of rigid rules, except for the Orthodox. But is Jewishness something one “aspires” to? Does anyone need to aspire? The bar is very low. You wanna be Jewish? Be Jewish. It’s not like anybody’s going to stop you. Buy a pair of candlesticks. Say Sabbath prayers. You don’t even have to do that. In my book, you’re Jewish if you say you are.  Which Musk pretty much did. Though he seems to think Judaism is something you get from close contact with others, like pink eye. “Two-thirds of my friends are Jewish,” Musk said. “I have twice as many Jewish friends as non-Jewish friends. I’m like, Jewish by association.” It doesn’t work like that. Having Christian friends doesn’t make me Christian, I hope. Rule of thumb: If you’re using your friends from a certain group as a human shield to deflect charges that you’re actually a bigot who hates that exact group, then you probably are. Which reminds us: Musk’s remarkable theological self-transformation doesn’t spring from nowhere. It was last November, not that long ago, particularly when discussing a faith that goes back to ancient Babylon, when Musk declared the idea of Jews — then a people quite apart from himself — pushing “hatred against whites” while welcoming “hordes of minorities” to be “the actual truth.” To his surprise — isn’t he supposed to be some kind of business genius? Because me, I’d have seen that coming (savviness; an alleged Jewish trait) — the X advertisers started  bolting in droves. Leading to Musk’s in-the-trenches conversion. Supposedly. Skepticism is another Jewish quality. So let me roll my eyes and be so bold — again Jewish, though we call it chutzpah — as to point out that Musk doesn’t really want to be Jewish. Rather, he’s reading from the “Heck, I’m Jewish myself” playbook, a cliche among haters. Think. What other controversial public figures declared their sudden Jewishness? Musk’s not the first. We Chicagoans shouldn’t have to grope for an example. How about Louis Farrakhan? He turned hatred for Jews into a kind of side hustle — whenever media attention wandered from his stemwinder speeches, he could reliably snag a little attention by focusing on the Jews’ supposed plots against him. (And what inept plotters Jews seem to be! We’re like the Keystone Cops. Blundering after Farrakhan for decades and yet there he is, age 90, and we have...",-1
"After Tesla's stock slide, Magnificent Seven face tests to keep market's throne",2024-01-28T13:01:21+00:00,https://www.zeebiz.com/markets/global-markets/news-after-teslas-stock-slide-magnificent-seven-face-tests-to-keep-markets-throne-273744,"Tech behemoths will face their next test to keep the market's throne this week, after a bleak quarter from Tesla sent its stock sliding, media reported Tesla shares have tumbled more than 26% so far in 2024 after the electric-vehicle maker reported a fourth-quarter operating margin that has almost halved to 8.2 per cent from the year-earlier period. Tesla also warned that it expects slower sales growth this year, CNN reported. That comes as the rest of the “Magnificent Seven” -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple and Alphabet -- continue climbing higher. Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Alphabet shares closed at record levels several times last week, CNN reported. Now, they face their own tests. Microsoft and Alphabet report earnings on Tuesday, with Amazon, Meta Platforms and Apple to follow on Thursday. Nvidia reports quarterly results on February 21. Excluding Tesla, the Magnificent Seven is projected to report an aggregate 53.7% fourth-quarter earnings growth from the prior year, according to FactSet. Companies in the S&P 500 index are expected to report a 10.5% earnings decline minus those six firms. The Magnificent Seven's quarterly results will be some of the most-watched this earnings season, due to the outsized influence the group has had over the broader market since last year, CNN reported. The returns in the Magnificent Seven drove about 62% of the benchmark index's 26% total return last year, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, CNN reported.

Tesla overwhelmed by competition from China’s EV players,2024-01-29T23:56:39+00:00,https://scotscoop.com/tesla-overwhelmed-by-competition-from-chinas-ev-players/,"Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker BYD poses significant competition for Tesla. BYD recently surpassed Tesla as the world’s top-selling EV brand during the final quarter of 2023 as it sold 526,409 pure electric vehicles, about 40,000 more than Tesla did during the same period. Around the same time, China became the largest car exporter in the world as it overtook Japan. Tesla shares fell 12% last week, their most significant drop over a year after the company reported earnings that fell short of expectations and warned that vehicle volume growth in 2024 may be lower than last year’s growth rate. Tesla failed to meet estimates as it reported a revenue growth of 3% in the fourth quarter and a minor increase of 1% in auto revenue from the previous year. On top of a slowing growth rate, Tesla can no longer compete with the amenities of Chinese EVs. The Huawei Aito M9, a popular Chinese EV, includes a refrigerator, collapsible front seats, and a projection capability that displays information on the road ahead.  Huawei Aito M9 vs. Tesla Model Y   Chinese automakers, including BYD, Nio, and Xpeng, have also taken sales outside of China as they look to compete with other companies. Many Chinese automakers are lowering car prices, which has impacted their profit margins. According to data released by the Chinese Passenger Car Association, China’s automobile industry saw a profit margin of only 5% — a decrease from 5.7% in 2022 and 6.1% in 2021. China’s automobile industry can thrive with slim profit margins because of help from the government. According to the Vice Minister of Finance of China, over $28 billion was spent on EV manufacturing subsidies and tax breaks in China over the 2009-2022 period to develop a globally competitive industry.  Many lawmakers are starting to investigate this government support. Last September, the European Commission initiated an investigation into subsidies for Chinese EV brands.  A few months later, the Biden administration made vehicles utilizing Chinese-made battery parts ineligible for consumer tax credits. To further reduce heavy competition, the U.S. imposes a 25% levy on imported Chinese cars on top of a general 2.5% tariff on all auto imports. As of now, BYD does not sell cars in the U.S. because of tariffs, but they are sold commercially in Europe, Southeast Asia, Oceania, and South America.

The judge in the US state of Delaware ruled that the compensation of the Tesla chief executive was too much.

They were accused of breaching their duties to the maker of electric vehicles and solar panels, resulting in a waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment for Musk. Lawyers for the shareholders argued that the compensation package should be voided because it was dictated by Musk and was the product of sham negotiations with directors who were not independent of him.  Musk's pay package at Tesla is the largest in corporate America. The judge found it was negotiated by directors who appeared beholden to their headline-grabbing CEO. ""Swept up by the rhetoric of 'all upside,' or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?"" wrote McCormick.

			Trending:		 By Chris Isidore | CNN A Delaware state court judge has thrown out the 2018 pay package that helped to make Tesla CEO Elon Musk one of the richest people in the world. Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who oversaw the bench trial that concluded in November 2022, ruled Tuesday that Musk and the Tesla board “bore the burden of proving that the compensation plan was fair, and they failed to meet their burden.” The 303 million split-adjusted stock options that Musk had received as part of the package are worth $51 billion today, when calculated using Tuesday’s closing price, less the modest exercise price of $23.34 a share. The case was argued in Delaware, where Tesla and many other major US corporations are incorporated. While Musk did not have an immediate comment on the decision, he did tweet Tuesday, “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.” Attorneys for the shareholders who brought the suit had argued that the package of stock options was excessive and that the directors on Tesla’s board were not truly independent and were too close to Musk to protect shareholders’ interests. They also argued that the financial targets the company had to hit for Musk to qualify for each of the 12 separate blocks, or “tranches,” of stock were not the “stretch performance goals” as the company told shareholders when seeking their approval of the package. Instead, they argued the milestones were essentially the same as the company’s internal growth projections that were being shared with banks and rating agencies. Attorneys for Musk and the Tesla board argued the pay package was approved by a shareholder vote. Excluding the votes owned by Musk and his brother, 73% of the shares voting in that election supported the pay package. Related Articles

They also argued that the shareholders had seen their Tesla shares massively increase in value since it was granted. The company’s market cap was valued at $54 billion at the time the pay package was approved. It had risen to $607 billion as of the close of trading Tuesday, a gain of more than 1,000%. The Tesla attorneys argued that Musk was a key to that rise in the company’s value and that the pay package was therefore reasonable compensation. The Tesla attorneys also argued that Musk, who does not receive a cash salary or bonus, would be uncompensated if the package was thrown out. But McCormick ...",-2
Musk may drop below Bezos in world’s richest list after court rules he cannot keep $56bn Tesla payout,2024-01-30T23:31:42+00:00,https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/elon-musk-net-worth-tesla-lawsuit-b2487701.html,"Notifications can be managed in browser preferences.

A court in Delaware ruled on Tuesday that the SpaceX and Neuralink boss could not keep the massive pay package he received from Tesla, the electric car company that he has run since 2008. The ruling was a victory for Tesla shareholders who had accused Mr Musk of effectively dictating the terms of his own pay to board members who were not truly independent of him. If implemented, the court's order would slash Mr Musk’s estimated $200bn-plus fortune and probably drop him below Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and French fashion baron Bernard Arnault in the rankings of Earth’s wealthiest humans. ""Put simply, neither the compensation committee nor the board acted in the best interests of the company when negotiating Musk’s compensation plan. In fact, there is barely any evidence of negotiations at all,"" wrote judge Kathaleen McCormick. She described Mr Musk as a ""superstar CEO"" who used his influence over the company and close ties with multiple board members to create a ""deeply flawed"" approval process that arrived at an ""unfair price"". In response, Mr Musk quipped: “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.""  Tesla shares slipped by as much as 4 per cent in after-hours trading on Tuesday evening. Both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq exchange require the majority of a company’s board of directors to be independent of the company before its shares can be traded on the open market. During the trial, Tesla’s lawyers argued that the mammoth pay package – approved in 2018 by the board and then by shareholders – was necessary to keep one of the world’s foremost engineers focused on the firm. At the time, Tesla was mired in “production hell” and struggling to produce its Model 3 sedan in large numbers. Mr Musk’s deal awarded him an extra 1 per cent of the company’s shares for each commercial milestone that he reached. This, Ms McCormick wrote, was ""the largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets by multiple orders of magnitude"". Since then, the company has smashed past all 12 milestones and become one of the most valuable enterprises in the world, propelling Mr Musk from the mid-twenties of Forbes’ rich list all the way to the top. At their peak, Tesla’s shares traded at nearly 14 times their value at the beginning of 2020, and even today – after a sustained period of economic gloom and a rough year for the company – they remain more than five times that level.

Why Tesla Batteries May Not Charge In Subzero Temperatures (And What To Do About It),2024-01-31T23:15:35+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1502236/why-tesla-batteries-wont-charge-subzero-temperatures-explained/,"
Depending on where you live, bitter cold may be a way of life in the winter. However, what you may not have known when you bought your Tesla is that those frigid temperatures could keep you from getting where you need to be. When temperatures drop below zero, the driving range of electric vehicles (EVs) drops along with them. What's worse is that sometimes their batteries stop working altogether. As EVs become more commonplace, this can wreak havoc — preventing people from getting to work, causing lines at Tesla charging stations, and frustrating delays.





The cold weather can even take a toll on the amount of time spent charging an EV. According to CBS News Chicago, when asked about the effect of cold weather on his Tesla, one driver reported, ""A charge that should take 45 minutes is taking two hours."" This happens because the colder it is, the less energy EV batteries absorb. While extreme cold is one of the reasons your car battery keeps dying, the problem is more pronounced in EVs. All of this can become a significant headache for Tesla owners living in cold climates.

Lithium-ion batteries power Teslas and most EVs, much like the batteries you find in laptops and smartphones, only much bigger. These batteries store the energy that makes your Tesla work. While the optimal temperature for a Tesla battery is between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the car performs well in a range of temperatures before it begins to run into problems. However, once the mercury drops below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, Teslas may start to experience reduced efficiency and longer charging times.

Three Important Things To Consider Before Owning Your First EV,2024-01-31T23:00:00+00:00,https://jalopnik.com/three-important-things-to-consider-before-owning-your-f-1851198228,"I worked at the Tesla store in Boston while I was studying at Boston University, around the same time that the Model 3 was super delayed and reservation holders were pissed, but I talked to a lot of folks who were considering their first EV and it was my job to help them understand day-to-day EV ownership. Owning an EV is different than owning an internal combustion engine vehicle, and for those looking into owning their first EV, it can be intimidating. Here are three important things to consider before owning your first EV. The biggest difference between ICE vehicle ownership and EV ownership comes when you have to refuel your car. Folks who live in a single-family home and have a garage have the easiest avenue to happy EV ownership, but it may still be costly to upfit your garage with a Level 2 EV charger. For folks who don’t have their own garage or private parking situation, EV ownership becomes less convenient. If you can charge at home whether in your own garage or if your building has chargers on the premises, plug your car in at night and you’ll be good to go every morning. If you can’t charge at home, you will be reliant on public charging stations which are notoriously fickle. If you still go into the office, your office may offer charging stations which make for convenient charging. If you will be completely reliant on public charging stations, it’s important to understand what to expect. Public charging stations offer different speeds of charging, but you’ll probably want to find a Level 3 charger so you aren’t wasting hours waiting for your car to charge. Level 3 charging is likely to be more expensive than charging at home and more expensive than Level 2 chargers, but still likely less expensive than filling an ICE car’s gas tank. Public chargers will be in different states of disrepair, so you may have to try a few different charging stations before finding one that works best. It is important to note that some EVs can’t accept high-speed charging, so make sure you understand your car’s limitations. Tesla owners enjoy Supercharger access which is a massive boon, and I think the biggest selling point for owning a Tesla. The Tesla Supercharger network is generally more reliable and more abundant than other public chargers, so if your first EV is a Tesla, public charging is less of a concern. Due to Tesla’s unique NACS charging plug, non-Tesla EVs cannot widely charge using the Tesla Supercharger network, but this is changing slowly across the U.S. so soon most EVs will be able to access the Supercharger network. EV tax incentives are confusing, and they just changed in 2024, so it’s important to understand these incentives before showing up at the dealer since many EVs don’t qualify for the credit. Make sure you check your specific model’s trim to ensure it still qualifies for the incentive. The new 2024 rules actually make it easier to apply the money to the price of your EV, but the number of EVs that qualify for the money has dec...",2

Tesla plots Texas move: Musk vows to relocate electric car firm after £44bn pay snub,2024-02-01T22:46:10+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/markets/article-13034647/Tesla-plots-Texas-Musk-vows-relocate-electric-car-firm-44bn-pay-snub.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By Leah Montebello    Updated:  22:46, 1 February 2024      2 View  comments  Elon Musk has said Tesla will look to move the company’s legal base to Texas – just days after a Delaware judge denied him the biggest corporate payday in history. The billionaire said the electric car maker will hold a shareholder vote to transfer the group’s state of incorporation. The shift comes as Musk, 52, the company’s chief executive, reels from the court decision on Tuesday that voided his £44billion pay package. The judge ruled that his ‘unfathomable’ compensation, which was tied to performance targets and set in 2018, was inappropriately set by the firm’s board. It is unclear how the ruling will be implemented. But without the pay package, Musk’s fortune would take a hit – causing him to drop down the list of the world’s richest people. Pay row: : Tesla boss Elon Musk said the electric car maker will hold a shareholder vote to transfer the group’s state of incorporation He is currently said to be worth around £160billion. Bernard Arnault, the boss of French luxury-goods giant LVMH, is the second-richest person in the world, with £145billion. Immediately after the court judgment, Musk wrote on X: ‘Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware. ‘I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters.’ He then posted a poll on Wednesday evening on his social media account asking whether he should change Tesla’s base. With more than a million votes cast, the survey saw 87 per cent in favour of the shift. Following the result, Musk wrote: ‘The public vote is unequivocally in favour of Texas! Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer the state of incorporation to Texas.’ The tycoon, who owns about 13 per cent of Tesla, already has ties with the state after shifting the corporate headquarters from California to Texas in 2021. But Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College law school, said that any move to Texas would need to be instigated by the board. He added: ‘So, if he hasn’t, he should drop them a line because it’s supposed to be a board call, not the result of a poll on X.’ It is thought that switching the legal base to Texas will not change the underlying law behind the Delaware ruling. The latest setback adds to the issues which are plaguing Musk. Last month, he warned that car production at Tesla will slow this year as the firm posted a sharp drop in profits.  It comes as the company faces mounting pressure from Chinese rivals such as BYD which are looking to dominate the electric car market. Musk is also juggling a bumpy performance at X, which he bought for £34billion in 2022. The social media firm has come under major scrutiny for its content moderation and has faced ongoing action from major advertisers following reports of anti-Semitic posts on the site. In December, Musk told advertisers, who were traditionally the lifeblood of the company’s revenues, that they should ‘go f***’ them...",-2
"Eight Bay Area counties sue Tesla, claiming it illegally dumped hazardous waste from Fremont plant, other facilities",2024-02-01T22:12:34+00:00,https://www.siliconvalley.com/2024/02/01/eight-bay-area-counties-sue-tesla-claiming-it-illegally-dumped-hazardous-waste-from-fremont-plant-other-facilities/,"Today's E-Edition Morning Report in your inbox!  Morning Report in your inbox! Today's E-Edition Eight Bay Area counties claim in a new lawsuit that electric carmaker Tesla illegally dumped hazardous waste produced in its Fremont factory and its auto service centers around the region. District Attorneys in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties along with 17 other California DAs filed suit in San Joaquin County Superior Court this week, alleging the company led by CEO Elon Musk — who is notoriously defiant of regulations — broke a host of laws on labeling, transportation and disposal of toxic materials. The lawsuit, which singles out the Fremont factory for its generation of painting byproducts and potentially toxic spatter from welding car panels, states that Tesla handles, stores, transports, stores and disposes of used batteries and lubricating oils, brake fluids, lead-acid batteries, aerosols, antifreeze, cleaning fluids, propane, paint, acetone, liquified petroleum gas, glues and diesel fuel. The company broke state health-and-safety law by dumping toxic materials in trash receptacles at its facilities, and possibly “caused the disposal of hazardous waste at a transfer station or landfill that is not permitted to accept hazardous waste,” the lawsuit alleged. Tesla also broke a state regulation by not properly labeling and storing tanks and containers of toxic waste, and illegally transporting such materials, the lawsuit filed Tuesday claimed.

Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news Sign up for our free newsletter to receive the latest news The electric car company’s CEO said early Thursday that Tesla would get shareholders to vote on whether to switch its corporate registration to Texas, where its physical headquarters is located. “Tesla will move immediately to hold a shareholder vote to transfer state of incorporation to Texas,” Musk wrote on his social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.

His announcement comes after a judge in Delaware, where the company is currently registered, ruled Tuesday that Musk is not entitled to a landmark compensation package potentially worth more than $55 billion that was awarded by Tesla’s board of directors. After the ruling, Musk took to social media to to express his displeasure. “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,” he wrote in one post. He later added, “I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters.” The ruling came five years after shareholders filed a lawsuit accusing Musk and Tesla directors of breaching their duties and arguing that the pay package was a product of sham negotiations with directors who were not independent of him. The defense countered that the pay plan was fairly negotiated by a compensation committee whose members were independent and had lofty performance mile...",-2

"Tesla To Pay $1.5 Million After Lawsuit From 25 California Counties, Including SF, Over Illegal Dumping of Hazmat Waste",2024-02-03T23:03:41+00:00,https://sfist.com/2024/02/03/tesla-to-pay-1-5-million-after-lawsuit-from-25-california-counties-including-sf-over-illegal-dumping-of-hazmat-waste/,"The electric carmaker agreed to pay $1.5M to settle a case brought against it by California prosecutors, who say that the company improperly stored and discarded hazardous waste during manufacturing, this week. The district attorneys from 25 counties around the state, including eight Bay Area ones — Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma — jointly filed the lawsuit Tuesday in San Joaquin County Superior Court, per the Chronicle. The lawsuit claimed that Tesla violated many state regulations about the proper storage, disposal and management of hazardous waste. The suit singled out Tesla’s Fremont factory for generating hazardous painting byproducts, using contaminated materials, and potentially toxic spatter from welding car panels, as Silicon Valley News reported. It also alleged that dozens of Tesla service centers in Bay Area cities including San Jose, Gilroy, Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, Berkeley, Dublin, Fremont, Burlingame, San Francisco and San Rafael, produced toxic waste.  This lawsuit was the result of years of investigations into Tesla’s waste management, according to the Chronicle. The San Francisco District Attorney’s Office’s Environmental Division apparently started looking into it in 2018 and conducted undercover inspections of  trash containers at Tesla car service centers. Tesla pretty quickly agreed to settle, SF DA Brooke Jenkins said in a statement released Thursday. Jenkins said that Tesla agreed to proactively screen waste for hazardous material before disposal, adequately train employees on hazardous waste management, and enlist a third-party entity for annual compliance audits over the next five years. It also will pay $1.3 million in civil penalties, along with an additional $200,000 to cover investigation costs. Meanwhile, Tesla is still fighting lawsuits about the alleged racism and sexual harassment within the company.  Feature image via Unsplash/Paul Steuber.

Josselin Herjean, 51, ploughed his £50,000 car into the back of a white BMW carrying Kirsty Skinner, who had just given birth, three of her children and her partner. Dashcam footage shows Herjean, a Stock Exchange IT manager, swerving at high speed from the middle lane into the outside lane before hitting the rear of the BMW. The BMW is pushed into the concrete central reservation, forced into the air, before carrying on along the carriageway, out of control and in a cloud of smoke. Incredibly no one was hurt in the smash and the couple’s newborn baby was still at hospital. But the family said in an impact statement they were left ‘traumatised’.  Southampton Crown Court heard that Ms Skinner had had a C-section and when they were hit she clutched her stomach and screamed ‘my babies’.  Eleanor Randall, a nurse who witnessed the crash told the court Herjean had shown ‘no compassion’ towards the family and when she went to check on him, he was ‘throwing clothes’ out of his vehicle. The court heard that Herjean was in the midst of a psychotic episode due to the stress of working in a ‘high pressure’ environment. At a hearing where the clip was shown, a judge said it was a ‘minor miracle’ that no one got injured in the collision.  The crash happened in October last year, as Herjean and the family – which included children aged five, three and one – were driving along the M17 in Southampton, Hants. Prosecuting, Adrian Fleming told the court: ‘[Ms Randall] saw a red coloured Tesla overtake a vehicle at a very high speed – she estimated over 100 miles per hour.’ According to Ms Randall, the BMW, ‘doing about 70 miles per hour’ began to engage in a ‘perfectly normal overtaking manoeuvre’ towards the fourth lane of the motorway’. Woman killed in Waitrose car park by impatient driver with steamed up windows Dinner lady still working at 73 wins £3,000,000 house in prize draw Queen's 'favourite grandson' splits from girlfriend after three years Schoolboy, 13, stabbed in broad daylight attack Mr Fleming continued: ‘What happened next was that the Tesla, still going at a grossly excessive speed, pulled out without warning, and erratically, into lane four.’ It then hit the BMW in the rear. ‘The car jolted forward then it hit the central reservation and the back of the car jolted up into the air.’ Ms Randall said that when she told Herjean he had been doing ‘over 100 miles her hour’ – ‘he just shrugged’. He did not go over to check on the family, the court heard.  In a victim impact statement read to court, Ms Skinner’s partner, Jamie Swinfield said his newborn daughter ‘could easily have been orphaned’ and the impact of the crash felt like he had been ‘sucker ...",-2

Musk claims Biden is allowing migrant surge to pack Dem voter rolls: ‘Importing as many votes as possible’,2024-02-04T18:17:55+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/04/news/musk-claims-biden-is-allowing-migrant-surge-to-pack-dem-voter-rolls/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Elon Musk has wildly claimed the Biden administration is looking the other way as thousands of migrants illegally stream across the border because it wants to stack Democratic voter rolls before Election Day. The controversial Tesla founder took to his social media site X over the weekend with a “bet-you-didn’t-know” post accusing the White House of the migrant-turned-voter scam as Biden gears up for an expected nail-biter between himself and Donald Trump in November.  “Homeland Security Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas issued written guidance making it clear that: Illegal presence alone is not grounds for deportation,” the tech tycoon wrote. “Criminal charges, convictions or gang membership alone are not enough for deportation,” he said. “You basically have to be a convicted axe murderer to be deported! “That’s because every deportation is a lost vote,” Musk added. “They are importing as many votes as possible before the elections.” Despite Musk’s claims, federal law does not allow noncitizens to vote in national elections — and for the new migrants to become US citizens, it would likely take years.  Noncitizens also are barred from casting ballots in state elections, although some municipalities allow voting at the local level. New York City does not allow noncitizens to vote. In ripping the Democratic White House’s border policies, the eccentric billionaire also pointed to last week’s migrant attack on two NYPD cops near Times Square, noting that six of the seven asylum-seekers arrested so far has been released without bail after getting busted in the shocking caught-on-video attack on New York’s Finest.  The Post reported that the freed accused migrant thugs have since fled to California. “As happened this week, you can literally assault police officers in broad daylight in New York, be released with no bail, give everyone the finder and ‘still’ not be deported!!” Musk wrote. “Outrageous.” One of the migrants charged in the Saturday night assault, Jhoan Boada, 22, gave reporters the finger as he walked out of Manhattan Criminal Court without bail.  At least four of them — Darwin Andres Gomez, 19; Kelvin Servica Arocha, 19; Wilson Juarez, 21; and Yorman Reveron, 24 — gave phony names to a church-affiliated nonprofit that helps migrants and hopped on a bus out of town, law-enforcement sources said.  Only one of the accused asylum-seeking brutes, 24-year-old Yohenry Brito, was ordered held on bail, with the judge setting it at $15,000 in cash or a $50,000 bond.  More than 170,000 migrants have flooded the five boroughs since the spring of 2022, with a handful occasionally running afoul of the law — including with the high-profile cop beating.  Republicans on Capitol Hill and even some Democrats have slammed President Biden and his administration for its handling of the migrant crisis at the US border.  Musk’s online claims about voter-packing fueled by the migrants come as a Republican-...",0
Elon Musk of Tesla routinely took illegal drugs and his fellow directors knew says new press reports,2024-02-04T18:17:00+00:00,https://businessday.ng/news/article/elon-musk-of-tesla-routinely-took-illegal-drugs-and-his-fellow-directors-knew-says-new-press-reports/,"  BusinessDay  BusinessDay  February 4, 2024 Elon Musk’s use of illegal drugs was common knowledge among several current and former Tesla Inc. and SpaceX directors, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. There was concern about the volume of Musk’s illegal drug use and that he consumed drugs with some of his board members, the newspaper reported, citing people who have witnessed the drug use or were briefed on it. The board didn’t hold investigations on the issue, nor did it document any concerns, the paper said. The relationship between Musk and his directors was slammed by a Delaware judge this week, who cited the board’s conflicts of interest in her ruling that Musk’s $55 billion pay package was excessive. Musk and his lawyer, Alex Spiro, didn’t respond to the WSJ’s requests for comment. The paper previously reported that Musk had used LSD, cocaine, ecstasy and psychedelic mushrooms, often at private parties. Spiro told the WSJ in that report that Musk was regularly and randomly drug-tested at SpaceX and had never failed a test. Some friends and directors felt they had to take illegal drugs with Musk as it could otherwise upset him, the paper reported Saturday, citing some of the people. They also didn’t want to risk “losing the social capital” of being in his circle, the paper said.
Musk responded on X to the WSJ story last month about his alleged drug use. “Whatever I’m doing, I should keep doing it!” Musk posted on X, citing Tesla and SpaceX as being the world’s most valuable car and space companies. “If drugs helped improve my net productivity over time, I would take them!” Musk oversees six companies: Tesla, SpaceX and X, the social media company formerly known as Twitter; the tunnelling venture The Boring Co.; brain implant developer Neuralink; and artificial intelligence startup xAI.

Elon Musk’s $56 Billion Pay Package Nixed As Unfair To Shareholders – OpEd,2024-02-05T23:32:28+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWeDNkdO1dUOYGFk24e89-qg,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   Elon Musk. Photo Credit: JD Lasica, Wikimedia Commons By Dean Baker  A Delaware state court judge ruled that the $56 billion pay package awarded to Elon Musk by Tesla’s board of directors in 2018 was illegal. The gist of the ruling was that the board was composed of people who were close friends or relatives of Musk. The judge ruled that they gave him an outlandish compensation package, based on targets that they knew would be easily reached. She therefore threw out the contract. To get an idea of the size of the pay package, Elon Musk’s compensation came to 89 percent of Tesla’s gross (pre-tax) profits over the years 2019-2023. It seems unlikely that that the company could not have attracted a competent CEO who would have agreed to work for a sum substantially less than 90 percent of the company’s profits. It is also seems likely that if an independent board had offered Musk a contract for 1-2 percent of the current contract ($560 million to $1,120 million) that he would have taken it, since it is unlikely that he had better paying options. It is worth noting that the contract was not thrown out for moral reasons – the judge did not indicate that she felt Musk was making too much money in a general philosophical sense. It was thrown out because the judge determined that a board closely controlled by the CEO was ripping off shareholders with his generous compensation package. Although most boards are not as tightly controlled by a CEO as Tesla’s, boards generally view their allegiances as being first and foremost to top management and not to shareholders. This is a main cause of outlandish CEO pay. Last fall, when the UAW negotiated new contracts with the Big Three, it was striking how out of line CEO pay at the U.S. companies was compared with their counterparts in other wealthy countries. The pay of the top execs at Stellantis, Ford, and GM was $21 million, $25 million, and $29 million, respectively. By contrast, at BMW, Mercedes, and Porsche, it was $5.6 million, $7.5 million, and $7.9 million. At the large Japanese manufacturers, it was $2.3 million at Honda, $4.5 million at Nissan, and $6.7 million at Toyota. It would be difficult to claim that the fact that, GM’s CEO got more than five times the pay of BMW’s CEO, and more than ten times the pay of Honda’s CEO, is explained by superior performance. Clearly the issue is different rules and norms of corporate governance that restrain CEO pay in other countries more than in the United States. If we looked to change the rules of corporate governance, to give more control to shareholders, it is likely that we can bring pay of CEOs here more in line with their pay elsewhere in the world. This is a big deal, not just because a small number of CEOs get outlandish pay, but because the pay of CEOs distorts the pay structure at the top more generally. If CEOs got $3 million or $4 million, rather than $20 million or $30 million, the CFO and other top execs would see cor...",-3
Izraelski vojni avion grmeo iznad Beograda: Čuo se na više od deset kilometara kada je poleteo,2024-02-05T23:22:15+00:00,https://aero.telegraf.rs/vojna-avijacija/3831471-izraelski-vojni-avion-grmeo-iznad-beograda-cuo-se-na-vise-od-deset-kilometara-kada-je-poleteo,"Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min.

Izraelsko vazduhoplovstvo nije zamenilo motore na svojim avionima Boeing 707 ali nastavlja da ih koristi kao pouzdane transportere i avio-cisterne, uprkos starosti. Avion koji je danas sleteo u Beograd pod oznakom leta IAF021 proizveden je pre 49 godina. Prvi korisnik je bila vlada Malezije a leteo je i u avio-kompaniji British Caledonian, rumunskoj kompaniji JARO International, kao i u Dubai Air Wing, odnosno Kraljevskom odeljenju (Royal Flight) UAE čiji je zadatak prevoz kraljevske porodice i najviših zvaničnika Ujedinjenih Arapskih Emirata. Konačno ga je kupila Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) 1996. godine a kasnije je u nekom trenutku i konvertovan u kombinovanu tanker/transport konfiguraciju Sa aerodroma Nikola Tesla Boeing 707-300 na letu IAF022 poleteo je nešto posle 17:00 a prema javno dostupnim podacima servisa za praćenje letova Flightradar24.com kao destinacija naveden je aerodrom Beeršeba (VTM), odnosno vazduhoplovna baza Nevatim. Iako je poleteo u pravcu severozapada - u upotrebi je bila poletno-sletna staza 30L - buka motora dizajniranih u pedesetim godinama prošlog veka mogla se čuti i na Banovom Brdu koje je vazdušnom linijom udaljeno desetak kilometara od praga piste. Boeing 707 kada je poleteo daleke 1954. godine uneo je revoluciju u vazdušni saobraćaj: bio je to prvi masovno proizvođeni mlazni putnilki avion za dugačke letove, kako transkontinenatalne prvenstveno po Americi ali i one prekookenske.

Tesla stock drops as investors scrutinize board’s close personal ties to Elon Musk,2024-02-05T20:53:19+00:00,https://kesq.com/money/cnn-business-consumer/2024/02/05/tesla-stock-drops-as-investors-scrutinize-boards-close-personal-ties-to-elon-musk/," By Allison Morrow, CNN New York (CNN) — Tesla shares fell nearly 4% Monday after a Wall Street Journal report shed light on Elon Musk’s unusually close personal and financial ties with members of the carmaker’s board of directors, fueling concerns on Wall Street about a lack of real oversight on one of the world’s most powerful CEOs. The revelations by the Journal come less than a week after a Delaware Chancery Court judge struck down Musk’s unprecedented, multibillion-dollar pay package, calling the board’s approval process “deeply flawed” because of how many people involved were “beholden” to Musk, and bringing renewed scrutiny to his deep relationships with ostensibly independent board members. Throughout her ruling, Judge Kathaleen McCormick noted that the people who were supposed to negotiate Musk’s pay on Tesla’s behalf were, in fact, far from independent. Musk has extensive ties with board members, including Ira Ehrenpreis, who personally and through his business has invested “tens of millions of dollars” in Musk-controlled companies. Ehrenpreis is also a close friend to Kimbal Musk, Elon’s brother, who is also a Tesla board member. Ehrenpreis attended Kimbal’s wedding in Spain, and also invested in Kimbal’s restaurant company, The Kitchen Group. Another member of the compensation committee, Antonio Gracias, has both business and personal ties with the CEO. McCormick noted that Gracias and Musk had spent Christmas together, and even vacationed with Musk’s family “on a regular basis,” taking numerous vacations with Musk’s cousins, as well. The relationship is not strictly limited to vacations, however, with Gracias having acquired “dynastic or generational wealth” from having invested in Musk’s companies. In another instance, the judge emphasized the role of Tesla’s general counsel Todd Maron — who was previously Musk’s divorce lawyer — in advising Tesla’s board and compensation committee. Maron was “totally beholden to Musk,” McCormick wrote in her ruling last week, adding that Maron’s admiration for Musk “moved him to tears” during both his deposition and in trial testimony. Maron’s team prepared “an aggressive timeline for approving a compensation plan,” McCormick wrote in her more than 200-page ruling. The break-neck speed of the process “reflected a reckless approach to a fiduciary process.” Robyn Denholm, the Tesla board chair, doesn’t appear to have had any personal relationship with Musk outside of her service on the board, McCormick wrote. Though the vast majority of Denholm’s wealth — including what Denholm called a “life-changing” $280 million sale of Tesla options — came from her position as a board member. The Journal notes that the Nasdaq exchange, where Tesla trades, requires that an independent director can’t be an employee, a family member or someone whose relationship “would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment.” Tesla didn’t immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. Tesla’s stock is down nearly 30%...",-3

What you need to know about the 2024 Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place,2024-02-06T23:31:38+00:00,https://chicago.suntimes.com/business/2024/2/6/24063791/chicago-auto-show-2024-mccormick-place-tesla-lucid-motors-rivian,"Consumers browse different vehicles on display at the Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place last year. Anthony Vazquez/Sun-Times file The Chicago Auto Show returns to McCormick Place Convention Center on Saturday, with a record number of electric vehicle manufacturers, including the debut of Tesla and Lucid Motors, stepping into the spotlight amid the loss of a mainstay automaker. The 10-day event, which organizers tout as the largest auto show in the country at 750,000 square feet, will feature almost 1,000 vehicles and hundreds of thousands of square feet of test-driving tracks.  Electric vehicles will be in the spotlight this year. With nine electric vehicle manufacturers set to attend, the show will feature not just opportunities to purchase these cars, but also information for potential buyers unfamiliar with electric cars. This will be the first year at the auto show for brands including Tesla and Lucid Motors. In addition to Models X and Y, Tesla will be showing the Model 3, which has been redesigned for 2024, featuring a sleeker look and fresher cabin with an 8-inch screen in the rear. Rivian was also supposed to make their Chicago Auto Show debut this year, but dropped out last minute due to complications, a Chicago Automobile Trade Association representative said. “For a lot of these car companies, it’s their first auto show, so it’ll be interesting to see how they do compared to the others,” said Mark Bilek, Chicago Automobile Trade Association’s senior director of project management, membership and technology.  “The cars are the stars of the show, and there’s lots of cool, new and exciting cars here,” Bilek said. These include the Cadillac Escalade IQ, a full-size electric vehicle, a new model of the Ford Bronco Raptor and new developments on the Toyota 4Runner. “It’s very interactive and a really great opportunity to escape the dreary weather here in February.” After temperatures soar into the 50s on Thursday and Friday, nearing record temps, winter returns as temperatures drop back to a more seasonable 30s and 40s with a few days of gray skies. This year’s exhibition will feature three indoor test tracks, three outdoor “ride-and-drives” and nine electric vehicle manufacturers on the Chicago Drives Electric test track — but nothing from Stellantis, the manufacturer behind brands including Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Alfa Romeo and Fiat.  It’s been over a month since Stellantis pulled out of the show. The company cited “the impact of a challenging U.S. automotive market,” removing themselves from North American auto shows for a while to cut costs.  Fans disappointed about the loss of the Camp Jeep test track can look forward to test tracks by other manufacturers this year — the Bronco track’s hills should provide a comparable thrill, Bilek said.  Other highlights include Honda’s Motocompacto, a portable electric scooter, and a slate of supercars from luxury brands.  The auto show will feature a number of special days that include uniqu...",2

They’d heard from their uncle or coworker or whoever that Teslas were self-driving, and trying to bring them back to reality just didn’t work. These days, though, things are a little different. The Drive reports that according to a recent Forbes Legal survey, most Americans are skeptical of self-driving claims and think true autonomy is a lot further in the future than some companies would like to claim.  Of the 2,000 people surveyed, a whopping 93 percent of respondents said they were concerned with the safety of self-driving cars. Additionally, 61 percent said they wouldn’t trust their loved ones’ safety to a self-driving car, and 51 percent said they didn’t foresee themselves using a self-driving vehicle in the next five years. When it came to trusting a self-driving vehicle, 46 percent said they were somewhat or very distrustful, while 34 percent said they were somewhat or very trusting of the technology. Twenty percent didn’t have an opinion either way.  What’s especially interesting about the results of this survey is that it appears that a large percentage of those who were asked had their minds changed by Tesla’s recent recalls. Apparently, hearing that more than two million Teslas had been recalled, which ended up being nearly every Tesla ever sold in the U.S., didn’t exactly lead to people being more confident in Tesla’s autonomous claims and technology. In fact, 62 percent of those surveyed said they’d lost confidence in Tesla.  The good news is, despite self-driving cars still being decades away from going mainstream, companies have already invested more than $100 billion in not making it happen yet. Oh wait, that might be a bad thing. Oops. Advertisement",-3

Tesla stokes layoff fears after asking which jobs are critical: report,2024-02-07T17:29:37+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/07/business/elon-musks-tesla-stokes-layoff-fears-report/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Tesla managers have been asked whether each of their employees’ positions were critical, stoking layoff fears in the company, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. Tesla sent out a single-line query for each job after canceling some employees’ biannual performance reviews, some of the people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. The electric automaker did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  It had 140,473 employees globally as of Dec. 31 last year. Tesla shares rose 1% on Wednesday.  They have slumped more than 25% so far this year. The report comes after CEO Elon Musk warned sales growth would slow this year despite price cuts that have already hurt margins at the world’s most valuable automaker and fueled investor concerns about soft demand and Chinese competition. Despite a renewed discounting push led by Tesla, new energy vehicle sales in top auto market China recorded its first month-on-month drop in January on slowing demand. The US automaker also lost its spot as the top EV maker by sales to China’s BYD in the fourth quarter.",-2
"Ford seeks smaller, lower-cost EVs to rival $25,000 Tesla, China",2024-02-07T16:47:00+00:00,https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1142232_ford-smaller-lower-cost-ev-platform-tesla-china,"Is Ford shifting its electric vehicle efforts away from large EVs like the F-150 Lightning, and focusing on translating the ethos of the Model T into the EV era? Taken at face value, remarks from Ford CEO Jim Farley on Tuesday suggest that may be the case. During the company’s Q4 2023 earnings, Farley and top executives summed that the automaker plans to shift the launch timing on some of its Gen 2 electric vehicles, with more attention paid to the cost and efficiency of its EVs—given, as was mentioned multiple times, a “new market reality.”  The company revealed it’s also reassessing vertical integration and battery supply, and “betting on new chemistries and capacities.”  Ford EV plans for Europe Farley noted that Ford is going to spend less capital on larger EVs and develop fewer of them, focusing its larger EV efforts on “geographies and product segments where we have a dominant advantage like trucks and vans.” Then he included a nod that appears to be looking beyond the Gen 2 EVs that are currently being finalized, to the company's Gen 3 EVs that are apparently just at the platform stage. “Now this is important because we made a bet in silence two years ago, we developed a super-talented skunkworks team to create a low-cost EV platform,” Farley said, referring to a team that Ford separately verified to Green Car Reports is led by Alan Clark, who led early development of the Tesla Model 3. “It was a small group, small team, some of the best EV engineers in the world. And it was separate from the Ford mothership; it was a startup.” “And they’ve developed a flexible platform that will not only deploy to several types of vehicles but will be a large install base for software and services that we’re now seeing at Pro,” Farley added.  Ford CEO Jim Farley Although Farley is referring to a new, secret platform, it does sound a lot like what Ford laid out clearly nearly two years ago. In May 2022, Ford announced that it was breaking out Model E as a distinct business that will “accelerate innovation and delivery of breakthrough electric vehicles at scale, and develop software and connected vehicle technologies and services for all of Ford.” One of the things Model E was tasked with was to “create ground-up, breakthrough electric vehicles,” including EV platforms, batteries, e-motors, inverters, charging, and recycling, and to employ “a clean-sheet approach to designing, launching and scaling breakthrough, high-volume electric and connected products and services for retail, commercial and shared mobility.”  Ford EV platforms for mid-decade, presented by Hau Thai-Tang So while Farley is reiterating that Model E is filling its purpose, Ford may have shifted to be even more focused on affordability since 2022, when EVs were in short supply and being sold with dealership-imposed premiums, well before a $25,000 Tesla was pegged for Texas production, potentially next year.  “All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost and efficiency in our EV product...",2

"Tesla Asks Which Jobs Are Critical, Stoking Layoff Fears",2024-02-07T16:04:59+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/business/tesla-stokes-layoff-fears-by-asking-whether-jobs-are-critical,"(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. staff are bracing for potential job cuts after managers were asked to affirm whether each of their employees’ positions is critical. US managers had to make the binary assessment of their deputies’ roles in recent days, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Tesla sent out the single-line query for each job after canceling some employees’ biannual performance reviews, some of the people said. The ask was consistent with Elon Musk’s emphasis on cost-cutting efforts in the midst of a marked slowdown in Tesla’s sales growth. The chief executive officer is known to take an unsparing approach with the companies he runs — in late 2022, he gave Twitter staff an ultimatum to either commit to his “hardcore” ethos or leave. Tesla representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment. The carmaker’s shares extended gains before the start of regular trading Wednesday, rising as much as 3% to $190.61. The stock has slumped 26% this year. Tesla has roughly doubled its workforce since 2020, ending last year with more than 140,000 people on staff globally. The company employs about eight times as many people as it did in 2016, the year before the Model 3 sedan launched. Headcount increased almost 10% last year even as Tesla made select cutbacks. In February 2023, the company terminated dozens of employees in Buffalo, New York, who labeled data for its driver-assistance system Autopilot. The carmaker denied that it had fired the workers in response to a union campaign announced that week. Musk, 52, said during Tesla’s quarterly earnings call last month that the company was “between two major growth waves” — the first springing from its introduction of the Model 3 and Y, and the next expected to come from a lower-cost vehicle aimed for late next year. Tesla has flagged ample spending toward that next-generation electric vehicle and other growth initiatives, budgeting more than $10 billion in capital expenditures this year. Analysts also are expecting the company to increase spending on research and development to about $4.5 billion. With spending on capex and R&D rising, Tesla also warned last month that it’s approaching the limits of lowering costs on its existing lineup. “This is a constant exercise, and we just have to chase down every penny possible,” Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja said during the company’s Jan. 24 earnings call. “We have a strong team which is hyper-focused on this.” Read More: Tech Layoffs Continue to Roil Industry With 32,000 Jobs Cut In a blog post on the job cuts in Buffalo around this time a year ago, Tesla said it rates employees’ performance on a scale of 1 to 5 every six months, and that it had scheduled “exits” for low performers roughly two months ahead of their reviews.

Why did Tim Cook's pay package hold up in court while Elon's failed?,2024-02-08T22:21:12+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/02/08/tim-cook-elon-musk-apple-tesla-ceo-compensation/,"Just a week after Elon Musk’s $55 billion Tesla payday was struck down by a Delaware judge, a New York court dismissed a challenge to Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation package, which clocked in at under $100 million. Some coincidence. At face value, the two cases seem to have a lot in common. Both were shareholder suits waged against some of the highest-paid superstar tech CEOs in the world. And both were filed amid a backdrop of increased public scrutiny over executive compensation in recent years, which is near all-time highs across S&P 500 companies. But for all their similarities, from a legal standpoint the two cases are apples and oranges—and Cook was always going to stand a better chance of holding on to his paycheck. Elon Musk’s $55 billion compensation package at Tesla made headlines last month after Delaware chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled in favor of a shareholder who argued that Tesla was paying its CEO an unfairly high amount with the moonshot grant. Plaintiff Richard Tornetta argued that because Musk wields so much power at Tesla and maintains close relationships with his board members, the supposedly independent board of directors’ vote approving his massive pay scheme was anything but. “Chancellor McCormick found that the process for setting Elon Musk’s pay was essentially controlled by Elon Musk,” said Tulane University law professor Ann M. Lipton in an interview with Fortune. “The board didn’t engage in any kind of pushback or real bargaining.” In response, Musk has threatened to relocate Tesla from Delaware (where almost 70% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated) to Texas, where a more favorable political climate could leave him less exposed to these types of challenges. While the Musk case was focused on a broad, more abstract legal question related to the Tesla board of directors’ degree of independence, the Cook case resolved yesterday was much simpler.  “The question before Delaware [in the Musk case] was simply, ‘Was the pay substantively unfair?’ whereas the question in the Tim Cook case was solely, ‘Was the proxy statement misleading?’” said Lipton. The Teamsters’ pension fund sued Apple last year, arguing that the company had misled investors by misrepresenting Cook’s 2021 and 2022 pay in its proxy statements and paying him more than it had initially proposed.  Because Cook and other Apple executives are primarily paid in equity known as RSUs, the company enlists financial models to estimate what Cook’s actual pay will be for shareholders’ approval each year.  (For CEOs, being compensated primarily with stock isn’t uncommon. Mark Zuckerberg famously earns just $1 in annual salary, but he’s made billions through Meta stock grants included in his compensation package. The Economic Policy Institute found in a report last year that stock-related pay accounts for over 80% of CEO compensation.) The pension fund that sued Cook argued that Apple misrepresented its CEO’s actual compensation package by downplaying the va...",-3

The Associated Press  February 8, 2024, 10:50 AM General Motors has hired a former Tesla executive, Kurt Kelty, to serve in the newly created role of vice president of Batteries as the automaker continues to work on its electric vehicle strategy. GM is still seeing strong demand for the EV products it has on sale now. The company expects EV losses to ease this year and hit low-to-mid single digit profit margins in 2025 as it adds more EVs to its lineup. Kelty will be charged with GM’s battery cell strategy and a new end-to-end approach. This will include the use of raw materials, research, developing and investing in new technology, commercialization of cells and packs, and end of life opportunities.  “For more than 30 years, I’ve been focused on helping develop and commercialize battery technologies that will aid in the transition to electric transportation. Joining GM creates an even bigger opportunity to help the industry make the switch and have a lasting impact on our planet,” Kelty said in a statement. Kelty will report to GM President Mark Reuss. “The foundation that GM has established coupled with Kurt’s exceptional battery expertise in leading battery chemistry development, establishing partnerships, building out supply chains and partnering closely with teams that have developed leading battery systems will help us achieve our electrification goals and position GM as a leader in EV technology,” Reuss said in a statement on Thursday. Kelty most recently served as vice president at Sila, where he was responsible for sales, business development, battery cell manufacturing partnerships and battery engineering involved in the adoption of Sila’s silicon anode material in electric vehicles requiring high energy density and fast charge.  Before that, he led the Tesla battery development team for 11 years. He was a key driver in the creation of Tesla’s first gigafactory, the largest lithium-ion battery and EV component factory in the world. Copyright

A Judge Voided Elon Musk’s $56 Billion Tesla Pay Package. Now What?,2024-02-09T15:56:46+00:00,https://observer.com/2024/02/elon-musk-tesla-pay-plan-ruling/,"Last week, a judge in Delaware rejected Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk’s infamous $56 billion pay plan, approved by the electric carmaker’s board in 2018. Business law experts say the ruling set a rare precedent and could have major implications for how large public companies pay their top executives.

Kathaleen McCormick, chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery, began her 201-page ruling by asking, “Was the richest person in the world overpaid?” Citing poor corporate governance and a compensation package too driven by Musk himself, she concluded, “yes.” The lawsuit was brought upon in 2018 by a Tesla investor owning a single-digit number of shares, but the case was ultimately decided on behalf of all Tesla shareholders. Musk can appeal the decision in the Delaware State Supreme Court; he has also threatened to move the jurisdiction of incorporation of Tesla from Delaware to Texas as a potential way to end the legal headache. In March 2018, the compensation committee of Tesla’s board approved a plan that would award Musk with stock options in 12 tranches over ten years if he can meet a set of lofty performance goals, including growing Tesla’s market capitalization to $650 billion, more than 10 times the company’s value at the time. The pay plan was created to incentivize Musk to grow Tesla’s market value and make sure that his compensation is “100 percent aligned with the interests of our stockholders,” Tesla said in a proxy statement in February 2018. Tesla valued Musk’s pay package at $2.6 billion in 2018. But at the targeted market cap that would allow the CEO to get paid, the package would be worth a whopping $55.8 billion. Musk became eligible to receive his first payout in 2020 after Tesla’s stock price soared. In 2021, the company’s market cap briefly surpassed $1 trillion. McCormick argued that Tesla’s board lacked members with independence from Musk to provide necessary oversight and that the 2018 proxy statement to shareholders included misleading statements.  “The Board never asked the $55.8 billion question: Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?” McCormick wrote in the ruling. She noted that Musk already owned nearly 22 percent of Tesla in 2018 and there’s no evidence he would threaten to leave the company if not given extra compensation. Additionally, McCormick argued that it was not clear to shareholders the level of influence Musk had in forming his compensation plan: he proposed the amount along with the conditions and payout timeline with little pushback. The board’s compensation committee also failed to show it independently benchmarked Musk’s compensation to the r...",-2
$1.72 trillion AI chip giant Nvidia has rocketed in value so fast it's about to pass Amazon as the 4th-most valuable U.S. company,2024-02-09T15:20:56+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/02/09/how-valuable-nvidia-amazon-billionaire-jensen-huang/,"Nvidia Corp.’s stock has rallied so much this year that it’s now threatening to overtake Amazon.com Inc. to become the fourth most valuable US company. Having added nearly Tesla Inc.’s entire market capitalization in the past two months alone, Nvidia is worth $1.72 trillion, just shy of Amazon at $1.76 trillion, as of Thursday’s close.  Google-owner Alphabet, the third most valuable US company after Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc., isn’t too far away at $1.82 trillion.  The shares are up more than 40% in so far in 2024 amid signs that demand for its chips used in artificial intelligence computing remains strong. But the stock has run so far, so fast that it’s reigniting concerns about whether the gains are sustainable, ahead of Nvidia’s earnings due later this month.  The surge prompted Michael Cuggino, president at Permanent Portfolio Family of Funds, to sell some Nvidia shares. “There is so much money chasing it that we thought it was prudent to trim our position a bit,” he said in an interview. “It still has a good future, but it’s too rich.” Its valuation, which spent the second half of 2023 steadily falling as Wall Street’s profit projections ballooned, is now rising again. Nvidia’s price to estimated profits has risen to 33 times, up from 25 times at the start of the year and near its highest level in months. Nvidia is the top-performing component of the Nasdaq 100 Index this year, just as it was over 2023, when shares more than tripled. The stock is by far the biggest outperformer among members of the so-called Magnificent Seven, in large part because it has shown the most significant jump in sales and profits as a result of AI-related demand. It’s not as if Wall Street is losing its conviction in Nvidia’s profit growth. The average of analyst estimates for 2024 adjusted earnings has risen 14% in the past three months to more than $12 a share. The upward revisions simply haven’t kept pace with the stock, which has added about $600 billion in market value over the same span. Nvidia’s multiple is hardly at nosebleed levels. Compared with other megacap tech stocks, it’s in the same league with Microsoft and Amazon and cheaper than Tesla. However, the valuation, coupled with the scale of its rally over the past several quarters, suggests additional gains may be harder to come by.  The stock recently broke above the average analyst price target for the first time since May, suggesting that even Wall Street firms, more than 90% of whom recommend buying the stock, aren’t expecting more upside. The rally also brought Nvidia’s 14-day relative strength index to 80, above the level of 70 that signals to some technical analysts that a stock is overbought. Still, bulls can easily point to fundamentals to justify the advance, including a bullish forecast from Arm Holdings Plc, which soared a record 48% on Thursday. The chip designer’s CEO singled out AI as a long-term driver, saying it “is not in any way, shape, or form a hype cycle.” Nvidia’s last sever...",0

Miffed Musk relocates Neuralink from Delaware after Tesla pay package ruling,2024-02-10T22:42:01+00:00,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/02/10/Elon-Musk-Neuralink-Tesla-Nevada-Texas-Delaware/1091707599670/,"


Feb. 10 (UPI) -- Neuralink Corp. founder and investor Elon Musk is relocating the tech company from Delaware to Nevada after losing a $55.8 billion Tesla pay package that a Delaware judge recently nixed.
Musk notified Neuralink shareholders of the change from Delaware to Nevada, which the Nevada Secretary of State finalized Thursday, according to Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.

""Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,"" he posted on X.
""I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters,"" Musk said in another post.

The billionaire also said he intends to have Tesla shareholders vote on his proposal to move Tesla to Texas from Delaware. Tesla is headquartered in Austin but was incorporated in Delaware in 2003.
Delaware Chancellor Kathleen St. Jude McCormick last month voided a 2018 Tesla pay package that mostly included Tesla shares in lieu of cash payments.
A shareholder in 2018 filed a legal challenge to Musk's $55.8 billion pay package, saying he dictated its terms and misled shareholders with incomplete disclosures in a Tesla proxy statement.
The shareholder said Musk controlled the Tesla corporation's board of directors, who approved the pay package, and dictated the terms of the package that included performance incentives.

Musk argued that he owned less than a third of Tesla's shares and wasn't Tesla's controlling shareholder. He said Tesla share values rose from $53 billion to more than $1 trillion since the board approved his pay package in 2018.
In ruling against and rescinding the payment package, McCormick said the process to create the compensation plan was flawed and involved people with whom Musk has longtime business, legal and personal relationships.
Musk asked Tesla's board of directors to create a new compensation package that would award him 25% of Tesla shares, which would nearly double his current 13% stake in the electric vehicle maker. The 25% stake in Tesla would give him more influence over corporate decisions, Musk told the board.
Neuralink is a U.S.-based neurotechnology company working to develop an interface system that would enable the human brain to communicate with tech devices using only a person's thoughts.
Company officials say the technology could help people afflicted with paralysis to live more independent lives and in January announced its first brain implant to start its human trials.

Tesla’s iPhone app gets better digital car key support with ultra wideband,2024-02-10T20:10:19+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/10/24068736/tesla-iphone-digital-car-key-ultra-wideband,"By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020. The Tesla app now supports ultra wideband (UWB) in the 2024.2.3 version of the app for iPhones. Spotted by Not a Tesla App, it promises more reliable and secure use of phones as digital keys than Bluetooth does because UWB’s precision tracking lets the car know exactly where the key is, which also helps protect against replay spoofing attacks.  The article says this even comes down to knowing which user is on the driver’s side of the car in the event that two people who have phone keys for the car are getting into it. It’s the same type of precision tracking that lets you accurately locate Apple’s AirTags even when the thing they’re attached to is lost in the cushions of your couch. The change isn’t available for Android users yet, but some recent Pixel and Galaxy phones include UWB chips, so support could come to them eventually. After downloading the update, users should be prompted to “Upgrade Your Phone Key,” followed by a request to give the app access to Nearby Interactions, an iOS setting that opens up the iPhone’s U1 chip to the app. That can be found under Settings > Privacy & Security > Nearby Interactions. According to Not a Tesla App, only the newest Model 3 and 2023 Model X support the feature, while the newer Model X and S and Cybertruck should get it down the line. All iPhones from the 11 onward come with UWB, excluding SE models.  / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Vancouver residents left wondering about mysterious Tesla that appears abandoned,2024-02-10T18:57:12+00:00,https://globalnews.ca/news/10286734/vancouver-residents-mysteriously-abandoned-tesla/,"Instructions: Want to discuss? Please read our Commenting Policy first. 
				If you get Global News from Instagram or Facebook - that will be changing. Find out how you can still connect with us.			 Surrounded by dirt and covered in sticks and leaves … it is clear a Tesla has been parked on a Kitsilano street for a very long time. Community members have been left wondering why the car has seemingly been abandoned, saying the vehicle hasn’t moved in months and city tickets keep piling up. “It’s definitely weathered at the very least … something’s happened to the rims here,” said Jon Smolensky, a nearby resident. “It feels like some sort of practical joke. If I had the keys to a Tesla, I’d be driving it. It is a Kitsilano special. I can’t quite understand what is happening here.” Neighbours estimate the car has been parked on West 1st Avenue at Balsam Street since at least September. While the seemingly abandoned car is a mystery, the more confusing fact is that it’s a Tesla Model 3 and even the oldest 2017 version starts at $36,000. “It’s a Tesla… it’s not like somebody dropped an old car from 1975,” said Roxanne Ledan, a Kitsilano resident. The City of Vancouver said the most recent ticket was issued in January and it was paid. At that time, city officials said they got a call that explained the car’s owner was away and the battery was dead. The car is now considered abandoned, with the City of Vancouver telling Global News it will be following through on a process that could lead to the vehicle being towed and impounded. But the city’s own rules say a car is considered abandoned if it is parked for more than 14 days on the street. “You’d think at some point this would get towed by the city,” Smolensky said The Tesla is not the first vehicle left abandoned in an area where parking is a hot commodity. In 2016, Global News reported on a vehicle parked on a west-end street for more than three years before it was towed. Residents said the Tesla should have been towed long ago. “We cannot find a parking (space) and this guy’s been parking here forever, where did (the owner) go?” Ledan said. It remains a mystery with a big price tag. The email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.

"If Elon Musk and His Buddies Think Delaware Is Too Strict, We’ve Got a Problem",2024-02-11T20:36:43+00:00,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/02/elon-musk-tesla-delaware-corporations-texas-nevada-south-dakota-kleptocracy/,"Mother Jones illustration; Patrick Pleul/Pool/AP; Getty There’s a piece in today’s Wall Street Journal about how billionaires like Elon Musk are now whining about Delaware—which literally has more corporations than people—because it imposes too many rules. Musk is fretting because a Delaware business court ruled that his $50 billion-plus Tesla compensation package, which was approved by a loyalist board, was excessive and therefore unfair to shareholders who had sued to stop it.  As the New York Times reported, the judge deemed the approval process “deeply flawed” and voided Musk’s contract, calling it “the largest potential compensation plan in the history of public markets.”  The Times noted in a follow-up piece that Musk owns about 411 million Tesla shares, worth around $78 billion, and that he’d pledged 238 million shares for personal loans. Borrowing against their vast portfolios, as ProPublica has detailed, is how Musk, Jeff Bezos, Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, and other ludicrously wealthy Americans have managed to legally avoid the lion’s share of income taxes.  Musk publicly lamented the Delaware decision that would dislodge him from the “world’s richest man” perch. He says he’ll seek to reincorporate in Texas, where Space X is headquartered, and where, as my colleague Abby Vesoulis reports, Musk has been flexing his plutocratic power at the expense of longtime residents. Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 30, 2024  The Journal points out that Musk isn’t the only major shareholder chafing at Delaware’s rules, noting that Texas is among the newbies vying to attract more corporate registrations and that another contender, Nevada, offers “broad protections for directors and officers in many cases that Delaware wouldn’t, including involving improper personal gain.” A state going out of its way to protect corporate crooks may shock you—or should—but Musk’s hissy fit is merely the latest skirmish in the race to the bottom for state corporate oversight. Both Vesoulis and Casey Michel, author of the book American Kleptocracy, detailed in our American Oligarchy package how competition between states to attract companies—which tend to overpromise and under-deliver on jobs and economic development—has resulted in a downward spiral that gives unelected billionaires power over local affairs and has made the United States the go-to destination for illicit wealth, foreign and domestic.  Need a tax haven? A place to hide and launder stolen cash?  Why bother with the Caymans or the Bahamas when you can get those services in South Dakota—and you don’t even have to relocate there. If you’re looking for other options, check out Alaska, Illinois, Florida, Ohio, Missouri, Nevada, Florida, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Wyoming, and the original culprit: Delaware. During the 1910s, Michel writes:  Not only did Delaware’s legislature up the ante on enticements—exempting corporations from taxes a...",-3

That anti-Tesla Super Bowl ad just got the wrong kind of attention from the NTSB,2024-02-12T21:58:03+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/12/dawn-project-tesla-ad-fsd-ntsb/,"The National Transportation Safety Board, a U.S. government agency that investigates crashes, has ordered the Dawn Project organization to stop using its seal after it appeared in a Super Bowl ad that called for consumers to boycott Tesla. The NTSB said in a letter that its seal must be immediately removed from the Dawn Project’s website and YouTube page, as well as any further airings of the commercial. NTSB said in a news release that it did not authorize the use of its seal and does not endorse the work of the Dawn Project. “We used the NTSB’s seal in our second Super Bowl LVIII commercial whilst we were referring to Tesla refusing to implement the NTSB’s prudent safety recommendations, recommendations with which The Dawn Project fully agrees,” an emailed statement from a Dawn Project spokesperson. “Unlike Tesla, we have great respect for the NTSB.” The Dawn Project, a safety advocacy group funded by tech CEO Dan O’Dowd, aired two ads during Super Bowl LVIII in Washington, DC, Dover, Delaware, Santa Barbara, California and Traverse City, Michigan — the city where U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg lives. The cost of airing the ads in those markets was $552,000. The ads criticize Tesla Full Self-Driving, advanced driver assistance software that O’Dowd has alleged has critical safety defects. FSD is not self-driving. Instead, the upgraded $12,000 system performs some automated driving tasks and requires a human driver to be ready to take control at any time. The Dawn Project has campaigned against the use of Tesla FSD for years now, including airing an ad in last year’s Super Bowl. This year, the group used the NTSB seal in its ad, which got the attention of the agency. NTSB General Counsel William McMurry Jr. called the use unlawful and noted the commercial has also been posted to the group’s webpage and YouTube page. The agency also included a screenshot of the ad, which is shown below. Image Credits: NTSB Image Credits: NTSB “Due to the nature of our work and the need to be unambiguously independent from commercial interests, we strive to protect the international reputation of the NTSB by preventing unapproved use of our seal,” the letter reads. “Contrary to Federal law, you did not obtain, and the NTSB did not grant, permission to use the NTSB Seal in your Super Bowl LVIII commercial or on any other materials. Moreover, your unauthorized use of the NTSB’s seal spuriously implies endorsement of your company and/or message by the NTSB.”",-2

Home means Nevada: Elon Musk’s Neuralink moves legal base,2024-02-12T19:59:59+00:00,https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/home-means-nevada-elon-musks-neuralink-moves-legal-base-2999841/,"Musk’s brain implant company moved its legal corporate home after a Delaware judge struck down his $55.8 billion pay package as CEO of Tesla. Elon Musk’s brain implant company Neuralink has moved its legal corporate home from Delaware to Nevada after a Delaware judge struck down Musk’s $55.8 billion pay package as CEO of Tesla. Neuralink, which has its physical headquarters in Fremont, California, became a Nevada company on Thursday, according to state records. Delaware records also list the company’s legal home as Nevada. The move comes after Musk wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that shareholders of Austin-based Tesla would be asked to consider moving the company’s corporate registration to Texas. “Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware,” he wrote in one post after the court ruling. He later added, “I recommend incorporating in Nevada or Texas if you prefer shareholders to decide matters.” Legal experts say most corporations set up legal shop in Delaware because laws there favor corporations. “Delaware built its preferred state of incorporation business by being friendly to company management, not shareholders,” said Erik Gordon, a business and law professor at the University of Michigan. On Jan. 30, Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick invalidated the pay package that Tesla established for Musk in 2018, ruling that the process was “flawed” and the price “unfair.” In her ruling, she called the package “the largest potential compensation opportunity ever observed in public markets by multiple orders of magnitude.” Musk, a co-founder of the privately held Neuralink, is listed as company president in Nevada documents. Messages were left Saturday seeking comment from Neuralink and Tesla. McCormick determined that Tesla’s board lacked independence from Musk. His lawyers said the package needed to be rich to give Musk an incentive not to leave — a line of reasoning the judge shot down. “Swept up by the rhetoric of ‘all upside,’ or perhaps starry eyed by Musk’s superstar appeal, the board never asked the $55.8 billion question: ‘Was the plan even necessary for Tesla to retain Musk and achieve its goals?’” McCormick wrote. Musk’s fans argue that he shouldn’t be paid like other CEOs because he isn’t like other CEOs. He and Tesla are practically inseparable, so keeping him as CEO is key to the company’s growth. He built the company from an idea to the most valuable automaker in the world, last year selling more electric vehicles than any other company. His star power gets free publicity, so the company spends little on advertising. And he has forced the rest of the auto industry to accelerate plans for electric vehicles to counter Tesla’s phenomenal growth. McCormick’s ruling came five years after shareholders filed a lawsuit accusing Musk and Tesla directors of breaching their duties and arguing that the pay package was a product of sham negotiations with directors who were not independent of him. The defense countered that the...",-2

"Elon Musk, Rupert Murdoch didn't operate in 'good faith' with Tesla, News Corp. pay transparency, says New York City",2024-02-13T23:22:39+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/02/13/elon-musk-murdoch-tesla-news-corp-new-york-salary-transparency/,"Tesla Inc. and News Corp. face some of the earliest regulatory enforcement actions under New York City’s closely watched pay transparency law. The city alleges the businesses ignored the requirement to include salary ranges in job ads or posted such wide salary bands that they didn’t qualify as “good faith” estimates. New York City’s Commission on Human Rights initiated complaints against nearly three dozen employers and third-party job posting sites including ZipRecruiter, Morgan & Morgan P.A., and Mazars USA LLP from October through December 2023, according to a commission webpage. The city’s job ad transparency law, like those passed in six states including California, New York, and Washington, aim to combat racial and gender wage gaps by arming workers with more information when searching for positions and negotiating their salaries. The New York City complaints provide hints at the direction state and local agencies are headed with enforcement of the law. The city human rights commission’s Dec. 4 complaint against Tesla Inc. noted at least four listings for New York City jobs without a pay range in June 2023, and four more that included ranges “not made in good faith,” such as an ad for a field service technician making anywhere between $22 and $58 per hour. Tesla also faced a citation but no financial penalty under Colorado’s pay transparency law in 2021. The commission alleged that News Corp.—which owns The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets—posted at least four jobs in July 2023 with pay ranges that violated the law. Those included an education reporter job paying anywhere from $50,000 to $180,000 annually and a video journalist position paying $40,000 to $160,000, according to the complaint dated Dec. 4. “What really stood out to me were the violations for posting ranges that the commission determined were not made in good faith,” said Stacey A. Bastone, an attorney with Jackson Lewis P.C. in New York. Since the city first passed its law in 2022, businesses have been wrestling with the best way to comply and many decided that advertising wide pay ranges was a good strategy, she said. That’s partly to give themselves flexibility to offer lower or higher salaries depending on candidates’ experience and qualifications, and also partly to assuage concerns about how current employees will react if they see advertised ranges that are too far out of sync with their own pay. “It’s a signal to employers that if they are going to have broad ranges, they need to have a reason for that,” Bastone said. “They’re potentially ripe for citations.” Colorado was the first state to implement pay range disclosure requirements for job postings in 2021. Even as other jurisdictions followed, businesses across the country have largely avoided financial penalties under these laws so far. Only Colorado has publicly disclosed any fines against employers for omitting salary ranges from their job postings. A handful of employers also are facing proposed clas...",-2
"Tesla's Updated Autopilot Still Not Safe Enough, Consumer Reports Says",2024-02-13T18:45:00+00:00,https://jalopnik.com/teslas-updated-autopilot-still-not-safe-enough-consume-1851252294,"Tesla was forced to recall nearly two million cars in the U.S. in December after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration determined that its Autopilot driver assistance system could be abused too easily. Right out of the gate, experts were skeptical that Tesla would actually fix the problems the NHTSA had with Autopilot, and when Consumer Reports got its hand on the updated version of Autopilot, wouldn’t you know it, the system was still abused far too easily. New warnings and driver notifications may be more visible than they were before, but by putting them on the center screen, Consumer Reports found that they actually take drivers’ attention off of the road. Also, while the strikes policy that Tesla introduced for its so-called Full Self-Driving beta feature now applies to Autopilot use, as well, Consumer Reports found that it isn’t reliable enough to encourage safer driving. Also, when drivers activate adaptive cruise control, it also activates lane centering, which wouldn’t be a problem except that if a driver has to, say, turn the wheel to avoid a pothole, it also turns off adaptive cruise control. The most concerning issue, however, is the ineffective driver monitoring system that Tesla still uses: Autopilot still lacks an effective direct driver-monitoring system (DDMS), which we believe is essential to the safe operation of ADA systems. Although the in-cabin camera is capable of determining if the driver is looking away, the camera can be covered entirely and Autopilot will still work on all road types without warning the driver that the camera is blocked. Additionally, when we covered the camera and kept one hand resting on the steering wheel, the vehicle did not limit Autopilot use or give any warnings to pay attention. According to [Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology at CR’s auto test center], the driver could be asleep or completely distracted and the car wouldn’t warn them as long as they are holding the wheel. In a statement, William Wallace, CR’s associate director of safety policy, called on the NHTSA to require Tesla to make more significant changes to its Autopilot software that actually improve safety. “In light of Consumer Reports’ findings, NHTSA should immediately revisit this recall and require Tesla to take stronger steps to protect people’s safety,” Wallace said. “NHTSA shouldn’t wait for any more crashes. It should take action now to make this recall better.” Advertisement",-3

LG Energy and Panasonic Making 4680 Batteries for Tesla Starting August 2024,2024-02-15T22:33:52+00:00,https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2024/02/lg-energy-and-panasonic-making-4680-batteries-for-tesla-starting-august-2024.html,"Home » Energy » LG Energy and Panasonic Making 4680 Batteries for Tesla Starting August 2024 Panasonic and LG energy will each start making 4680 batteries in different factories for Tesla starting around August 2024. The LG Ochang plant should have a combined 35 gigawatt-hour battery production capacity by 2025. LG Energy Solution had planned to secure a 200 gigawatt-hour production capacity in North America, Europe and Asia combined by the end of 2022 and 520 gigawatt-hour capacity by 2025. LG produced just over 100 GWh of batteries in 2023 but LG has more underused capacity. The capacity of the LG US plant was increased to 36 GWh annually last year.  Panasonic has a new factory of 2170-type cells for EVs in De Soto, Kansas. The plant is a $4 billion project with an initial output of 30 GWh/year. Panasonic said it planned to begin production between April and September 2024. Panasonic will produce a new and improved version of the 2170 cells used in Tesla Model 3 and Model Y at the plant in Nevada that it operates with Tesla sometime during 2024 or 2025. Panasonic will soon start another US battery manufacturing plant. Panasonic plans to raise its production capacity to 200 GWh by 2030 from its current limit of 50 GWh.  Samsung is building a production line with an initial capacity of 1GWh per year. SK On is likely starting the development of 4680 batteries.

Super Bowl Ad Slams Tesla’s Full-Self Driving Mode Used Around School Buses,2024-02-15T21:23:37+00:00,https://stnonline.com/special-reports/super-bowl-ad-slams-teslas-full-self-driving-mode-used-around-school-buses/,"Lost amid Sunday’s overtime thriller, a controversial Super Bowl ad criticized Tesla’s Full-Self Driving (FSD) Beta Mode for being unsafe and unreliable, including around school bus stops.  The ad was created by the Dawn Project, which has the goal of “making computers safe for humanity,” according to its website. The organization also ran a Super Bowl ad last year. This year’s ad, which aired regionally to select audiences in California, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and Washington, D.C., cites the case of a 17-year-old North Carolina boy, who was struck by a Tesla after exiting his school bus last March. The Tesla driver had activated FSD, which is supposed to detect and avoid obstacles and other vehicles. Dan O’Dowd, founder of the Dawn Project and CEO of Green Hills Software, told School Transportation News this week that he and his teams have run tests of Teslas operating near school buses and that FSD is unable to decipher the big yellow vehicle with flashing lights from a similar-sized truck with its hazards on. Additionally, O’Dowd said tests show that a Tesla using FSD often failed to stop for and hit mannequins placed in the roadway to simulate the presence of children. O’Dowd is a software engineer who created secure operating systems for the Boeing 787 and B1-B Intercontinental Nuclear Bomber, Lockheed-Martin F-35 fighter jets and NASA’s Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle. O’Dowd claims he has developed the only unhackable software in the world, which earned him the Caltech Distinguished Alumni Award in June 2021, and said that Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta mode is fundamentally flawed and unsafe. “You can see it on the [Tesla] display,” explained O’Dowd. “What do you do when you see a truck with its hazard lights on? Well, you stop, you peak around to see if there’s anybody in the other lane, and you go around it, right? That’s what it does. It does slow down sometimes but it’s going to go past the school bus because it thinks it’s a disabled vehicle and not a school bus. It doesn’t recognize a school bus. They need to teach it what a school bus is … They just haven’t done it.” He accused Tesla of being either incompetent or simply not caring. “They can’t figure out how to recognize a school bus? Then, they shouldn’t’ have their software on the road at all,” O’Dowd continued. “Instead, they are putting their efforts into parking … You’re not fixing a critical vulnerability while you put resources into basically marketing gimmicks, that’s just ridiculous.” O’Dowd, who unsuccessfully ran for a U.S. Senate seat to represent California on the sole platform of fighting Tesla FSD and Elon Musk, added that Dawn Project tests of similar technology in Ford and GM vehicles show they perform correctly. An email sent to Tesla seeking comment was not answered at this report. But Tesla sent O’Dowd a cease-and-desist letter last summer following another Dawn Project ad. Dinna Eskin, deputy general counsel for Tesla, argues that the Dawn Project manip...",-3
Elon Musk said it was 'time to move on' from hybrids years ago—but a windfall from them will help Japanese carmakers challenge Tesla in EVs,2024-02-16T23:11:33+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/02/16/japanese-carmakers-evs-push-helped-by-hybrids-windfall-elon-musk-tesla/,"Timing matters. When it comes to timing the transition to electric vehicles, several Japanese automakers may be getting it just about right—despite appearing to be late to the game at first. Rather than rush headlong into EVs, Toyota, Honda, and Mazda have focused on hybrid vehicles as a more practical transition—to great success. They’ve each enjoyed surging sales of hybrids, which has helped them achieve record or near-record profits. That’s positioned them well financially to invest in EVs today, with an eye toward entering the fray in earnest in the second half of this decade. Meanwhile, the sales growth of electric vehicles, while still strong, has recently slowed, prompting Ford and GM to pare back their production plans. This is partly because an initial wave of EV enthusiasts have already bought their vehicles, and everyday car shoppers are more likely to be turned off by higher prices, range anxiety, and poor resale value, among other concerns. Tesla, in a call with investors last month, warned of “notably lower” sales growth this year after a disappointing fourth quarter. CEO Elon Musk said his EV maker is “between two major growth waves” as it aims to start production of a more affordable new model late next year. One difference with that second growth wave for Tesla is that, unlike in the first, it will face intense competition from Japanese carmakers, whose EV pushes have been helped by surging hybrid profits, putting them on a stronger financial footing. In 2022, Musk dismissed hybrids as a phase, saying that it’s “time to move on” from them. He might be right in the long run, especially as regulators around the world push harder for EV adoption to meet climate goals. In California and New York, zero-emission mandates loom over the automotive landscape. Both states will require that all new passenger vehicles sold be zero-emission by 2035. But for now, many consumers are opting for hybrids, which use less fuel than traditional vehicles—easier on the environment and the wallet—even while still requiring occasional trips to the gas station. Currently, car shoppers are worried about the downsides of EVs, said Mazda CFO Jeffrey Guyton, as reported by Automotive News. “Our strategy is to follow regulation, yes, but also to pay close attention to what actual customers want,” he said.  Mazda, thanks in large part to strong hybrid sales, reported record profits in its fiscal third quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023—and is closing in on the same for the full year ending March 31. Guyton said hybrids are getting extra attention among U.S. consumers thanks in part to growing interest in electric vehicles.   “I think hybrid is benefiting a little bit from the hype around EV,” Guyton said. “Now there is a flattening of the EV market. And I think the people who used to be shouting EV and promoting EV have decided, well, if we cannot get people to take pure electric, hybrid is a good alternative.” While EVs accounted for less than 1% of Mazda’s global s...",-2
Everything To Know About Tesla's Dojo Supercomputer,2024-02-16T22:15:31+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1516714/what-to-know-about-tesla-dojo-supercomputer/,"
Tesla, the world's most valuable car brand, has repeatedly stressed over the years that it is not solely a carmaker but a technology company at its heart. It, therefore, shouldn't come as a surprise that the company built the world's fifth most powerful supercomputer in 2021. In 2023, Tesla laid the foundations of a dramatically more powerful version called Dojo. But before one digs into the details of the Dojo, one might ask why Tesla has gone all-in on silicon tech and why it needs all that computing power. 





Well, the simplest answer would be to improve its driver assistance tech stack, which includes Autopilot and the Full Self-Driving (FSD) bundle. To recall, Tesla recently started replacing conventional radar sensors in favor of traditional RGB cameras. Well, all of that real-world image capture tries to mimic how an average human would perceive the world around them. But training an AI isn't as simple as training a human because everything the cameras see needs to be labeled so that the car recognizes it in real-time and takes appropriate action. That labeling and training involves crunching multimedia assets at a crazy pace, which is worth petabytes of data per day from each car.
Nvidia, which helped Tesla build its first supercomputer, says a fleet of 100 cars will produce more than 1 million hours of video recording each year with just five cameras. Tesla delivered over 1.8 million cars in 2023 itself for reference. Needless to say, the company needs something like the Dojo supercomputer to fulfill all the computing demands. But more than just enhancing Autopilot and FSD tech, which Tesla considers critical for its future, the company also needs it for other ambitious ventures such as the Tesla Bot and improving other aspects of its cars.

"OpenAI releases Sora, a credit score–based dating app launches and an anti-Tesla ad comes under fire",2024-02-17T21:15:13+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/17/openai-releases-sora-a-credit-score-based-dating-app-launches-and-an-anti-tesla-ad-comes-under-fire/,"Welcome, folks, to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch’s regular newsletter covering noteworthy happenings in the tech industry. This week, OpenAI stunned the blogosphere with the release of Sora, a new AI model that can generate videos in impressively high fidelity. We’ve seen video generators before. But what makes Sora unique is its understanding of time and physics, which enable it to create not only more coherent videos than previous video generators, but also 3D worlds. Wild stuff! Elsewhere, startup Score released a dating app exclusive to people with good to excellent credit scores. And an anti-Tesla Super Bowl ad came under fire from the National Transportation Safety Board for using its seal without authorization. Lots else happened.

Tesla-Sized Satellite Will Crash Back To Earth This Week,2024-02-19T18:00:00+00:00,https://jalopnik.com/tesla-sized-satellite-will-crash-back-to-earth-this-wee-1851268280,"It’s always exciting when there’s something fiery to observe in the night sky, whether it’s an influx of shooting stars or the possible demise of the International Space Station. Now, there’s a new extra terrestrial object to look out for, as the European Space Agency is preparing to crash a satellite the size of a Tesla back to Earth. Catchily named the ERS-2 satellite, the craft has been in orbit above Earth since 1995. In the 29 years since its launch, it has studied sea temperatures and wind speeds on Earth to track changes to our climate. However, the craft was decommissioned back in 2011.  Now, Space.com reports that the end of the craft is nigh, as it will crash back into our atmosphere later this week in spectacular fashion. The ERS-2 satellite, which weighs roughly the same as a Tesla Model X, is predicted to fall back to Earth on Wednesday (February 21).  However, predicting exactly when it will come crashing down is proving trickier than some first thought. As the site reports:  ESA said that the re-entry [of] ERS-2 is expected to take place on Wednesday (Feb. 21) at 10:19 a.m. ET (1519 GMT), plus or minus around 19 hours. This uncertainty is due to the “influence of unpredictable solar activity, which affects the density of Earth’s atmosphere” and can therefore change how much drag pulls on the satellite on its way down, ESA wrote. It’s still too early to tell where it will come down, but we’ll have a better idea as the time of re-entry gets closer. The craft has reportedly now burned up all its onboard fuel, so is at the mercy of gravity for its return to Earth. However, there isn’t really much to worry about with this crash landing. In fact, the European Space Agency doesn’t project that much of the satellite will actually reach the ground (or sea) later this week.  Instead, the space agency says that the aging satellite will  burn up on impact. Despite weighing as much as an electric car, the ESA says that ERS-2 will break up into much smaller pieces when it reaches around 50 miles above Earth. After that, most of the chunks of space junk will burn up in the atmosphere with very few predicted to fall into the ocean.  So there’s no real need to worry about being hit by falling European space junk this week. Instead, pop your head outside and hope that you see a satellite burning up overhead, it might be cool.

Passenger jet is left with gaping holes in its side after slamming into light poles during take-off in Serbia,2024-02-19T16:15:53+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13100543/Passenger-jet-gaping-holes-slamming-landing-poles-Serbia.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By Miriam Kuepper and Perkin Amalaraj   Published:  16:03, 19 February 2024   |  Updated:  16:15, 19 February 2024      40 View  comments  A passenger jet has been left with gaping holes in its sides after slamming into landing poles during take-off in Serbia. The Air Serbia aircraft, an Embraer E195LR, was supposed to fly to Dusseldorf, Germany, from Belgrade last night but struck a runway light during take-off, which reportedly punched a hole into its fuselage. The 15-year-old plane, operated by Greek carrier Marathon Airlines, started its ascend but had to return to the airport for an emergency landing after an hour, after taking off at 4.37pm on Sunday afternoon.  The plane made, which flew with the flight number JU324, left the runway and looped twice in a square shape, before returning to the runway of Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, where it took off and landed, and performing one more loop.  Pictures showed the plane, which has a capacity of 132 seats, with an enormous hole on the left side of the fuselage.  Deep cracks can be seen across the body of the plane, and much of the connecting material between the wing and the body was exposed Deep cracks can be seen across the body of the plane, and much of the connecting material between the wing and the body was exposed.  In a video taken of the plane on the runway  foam and water can be seen dripping from the fuselage, suggesting fire crews were brought in.  Air Serbia told specialist aviation site TangoSix that no one onboard was seriously hurt.

Ford cuts prices on electric Mustang as demand softens for premium EVs,2024-02-20T17:58:23+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/20/ford-cuts-prices-on-electric-mustang-as-demand-softens-for-premium-evs/,"Ford is cutting prices of its all-electric 2023 Mustang Mach-E by has much as $8,100 as the automaker attempts to rid itself of inventory and compete with Tesla and its increasingly cheaper EVs. Total market share of new EV sales has grown, reaching nearly 8% in U.S. in 2023. But as market share has expanded, the consumer base has shifted from early adopters to early majority — a group unwilling to pay a premium for EVs, Ford CFO John Lawler told TechCrunch in an interview earlier this month. The price cuts come after the Mach-E lost eligibility for a $3,750 tax credit and sales of the all-electric SUV fell 51% in January versus the same month in 2023. Overall EV sales were down 11% from January last year. The Detroit Free Press previously reported the new prices, which were sent to the automaker’s network of dealers. Ford confirmed with TechCrunch the price cuts, which are only for model year 2023 Mustang Mach-E vehicles and range between $3,100 and $8,100. Ford Credit is also offering a couple of deals, including 0% financing for 72 months for qualified buyers and a $7,500 cash incentive to those who lease. That extra incentive is in addition to the tax credit Ford Credit already passes on to consumers. “The Mustang Mach-E is America’s No.2 EV SUV in 2023 and Ford is America’s No.2 EV brand,” Ford spokesperson Marty Günsberg wrote in an emailed statement. “We are adjusting pricing for MY23 models as we continue to adapt to the market to achieve the optimal mix of sales growth and customer value.” Image Credits: Ford Image Credits: Ford Automakers, including Ford, have been racing to compete with Tesla amid softening demand for premium-priced EVs. “Tesla ramped the 3 and the Y at the same time, which we believe created a false sense of demand,” Lawler said. “It was two new vehicles that was now in a segment, where it was affordable for early adopters and supply was very limited. And therefore, then you had this incredible growth, but their production was limited. And so it looked like there was this incredible demand, but it was the early adopters.” Lawler said when Tesla started dropping prices, the conventional wisdom was that the company was trying to disrupt the industry and “keep the rest of us out.” Instead, he theorized that Tesla was responding to the same changing market conditions. Tesla spent the latter half of 2022 and all of 2023 tinkering with the price of its four models: the Model S, Model X and popular Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The company, which doesn’t use a dealership model and instead sells directly to consumers, slashed prices every quarter last year — a tactic that pumped up sales and drove down profits. Tesla shipped a record number of electric vehicles in the fourth quarter, which helped it reach 1.81 million deliveries in 2023. Operating income also took a hit due to increased R&D costs, the ramp up of the Cybertruck and continued price cuts for its best-selling vehicles, the Model 3 and Model Y.",-2

It will be in the Downtown Plaza Shopping Center on Stockton Street, which Lower SaveMart anchors. Tesla reports it will be the second Supercharger station in the county, as there are already seven superchargers installed at the county-owned parking lot at 11875 Ponderosa Lane in Groveland. In neighboring counties, there are superchargers at the Copperopolis Town Square and in Jackson. The project team includes Tesla, along with the property owner, the Dwares Group, out of San Francisco. Asked for comment, Sonora Community Development Director Tyler Summersett notes, “The City of Sonora recognizes the growing market share of electric vehicles and the importance of being able to charge as part of a trip.  The central location of the Tesla chargers will hopefully encourage trips to Sonora by the traveling public who can enjoy our wonderful downtown and get a full charge at the same time.” Eight superchargers are being installed at the site and construction is underway ahead of the spring tourism season.

Tesla cancels $16K pie order at last minute — leaving California bakery owner ‘high and dry’,2024-02-22T17:44:14+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/02/22/business/tesla-cancels-16k-pie-order-at-last-minute-leaving-california-bakery-owner-high-and-dry/,"Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission. 
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 A California bakery owner was left “high and dry” after electric car maker Tesla placed an order for $16,000 worth of pies — only to cancel just before the delivery went out the door. Voahangy Rasetarinera, owner of The Giving Pies in San Jose, received the order on Valentine’s Day for 4,000 pies from a rep at the Elon Musk-owned company, she told NBC Bay Area. The Tesla worker reportedly told the black business owner — beloved by other Silicon Valley heavyweights — that the company wanted the pies delivered the following week for an event to commemorate Black History Month. Rasetarinera sent Tesla a quote, which the company rep approved, she said.  But Tesla’s vendor did not send payment. The next day, Rasetarinera said she inquired with Tesla about the lack of payment. “She said, ‘Oh, I’m so sorry that vendor hadn’t paid you yet, I think they’re kind of new’,” Rasetarinera said. “‘And I have a question for you, can we double the order?'” Rasetarinera agreed, though her staff had to work around the clock to complete the job. The bakery owner said that to accommodate Tesla, she had to cancel other orders as well as buy more ingredients. After taking on the heavier workload, Rasetarinera then said she received a text message from the Tesla rep, which read: “It unfortunately sounds like we will be changing plans and will not be needing this order. Thank you so much for your support I appreciate it.” Rasetarinera said that her business suffered a loss in excess of $16,000 as a result of the last-minute cancellation. “This abrupt reversal left me reeling, realizing the extent of the impact on my small business,” Rasetarinera wrote on her Facebook page.  “I had invested time, resources, and effort based on assurances from Tesla, only to be left high and dry.” When she inquired with Tesla about the cancellation, she was told the decision came from upper management. The “attempt to shift blame to upper management only compounded the betrayal I felt,” she said “To me, it was clear that Tesla’s corporate culture prioritized convenience over accountability, disregarding the livelihoods of small business owners like myself,” she wrote on her Facebook page. The Post has sought comment from Tesla. Advertisement",-2

The bottleneck stems from challenges in mass-producing what are known as 4680 battery cells, which are key to the Cybertruck’s success due to their superior energy density and cost efficiency. Currently, Tesla can only produce a fraction -- only a tenth -- of the required output, pushing it to lean on global battery manufacturers. LG Energy Solution, a leading South Korean battery manufacturer and a key supplier to Tesla, seems to be in a prime position to capitalize on this demand. However, the technical complexity and innovation required for mass production of these cells means it is still uncertain which manufacturer will lead in this area. What are 4680 battery cells, and why are they important? The 4680 battery's name comes from its dimensions: 46 millimeters in diameter and 80 millimeters in height. These cells are crucial for larger electric vehicles, like the Cybertruck, which require substantial, high-density batteries for a reasonable range. Tesla asserts these batteries can deliver up to five times the energy and six times the power of previous models while also cutting manufacturing costs by half. The demand for 4680 batteries extends beyond Tesla's Cybertruck to the broader electric pickup truck market in the US, as their batteries average 190 kilowatt-hours, much more than the 75 kWh typical in EV sedans -- offering lucrative opportunities for battery makers. Manufacturers like LG Energy Solution are developing what they call ""46 series"" battery cells, adaptable versions of the next-gen battery tech not confined to the 4680 dimensions, allowing for a diversified customer base beyond Tesla.   Which maker could capitalize on Tesla's hurdle? Faced with a critical shortage, Tesla is turning to its long-standing partners, Panasonic and LG Energy Solution, for the 4680 cells. Panasonic is in the early stages of pilot production in Japan and has plans for two US plants, but its progress has been under wraps following a reported production delay last year. LG Energy Solution is on a more definitive path, with CEO Kim Dong-myung announcing earlier this week the imminent start of production...",-1
"Tesla screwed a Black-owned bakery out of $16,000: ‘It felt like we didn't matter'",2024-02-23T21:31:27+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/02/23/tesla-black-owned-bakery-black-history-month/,"A baker in San Jose, Calif., blasted Tesla on Wednesday after the electric car company ordered $16,000 of pies for a Black History Month event, only to cancel the order on short notice and leave her out thousands of dollars. The Giving Pies owner Voahangy Rasetarinera wrote on Instagram that Tesla approached her bakery on Feb. 14 with an order of 2,000 mini pies to be delivered the following week. That afternoon, despite receiving a quote and getting approval for the order, Rasetarinera did not get payment from Tesla’s vendor City Flavor, where the order was redirected. Instead, she got a call from her Tesla point person after 9 p.m. the next evening asking her to double the order, she said on Instagram. By the end of the week, Rasetarinera still had not gotten payment. To make matters worse, the next time her Tesla contact reached out, it was to say that Tesla no longer required the order. “This abrupt reversal left me reeling, realizing the extent of the impact on my small business,” she wrote. “I had invested time, resources, and effort based on assurances from Tesla, only to be left high and dry.” Tesla and City Flavor did not respond to Fortune’s requests for comment. Read more: Black bakery owner jilted by Tesla credits Elon Musk effect with surge in business: ‘You either love him or hate him’ The Giving Pies has a cancellation policy, but because Tesla had not paid the invoice, Rasetarinera was not able to recover the $2,000 the bakery lost working on the order.  Rasetarinera had employees work extra hours to fulfill the order, and she bought pricier vegan supplies and turned down three other Black History Month catering opportunities to make time for Tesla’s order. This was the first time Rasetarinera had received an order from Tesla, she said — City Flavor had reached out to the bakery with a catering job last year for a Black History Month event, but turned down Rasetarinera’s quote. The baker told Fortune that a Tesla representative reached out to her on Wednesday to apologize, saying the original point person did not have the authority to promise to pay her. The representative invited Rasetarinera on a factory tour and offered her an opportunity to cater two Tesla events in March. Rasetarinera, who is Black, told Fortune that the snub had nothing to do with racism and that it was just a miscommunication. Still, there is a deep irony in the carmaker’s snub of a Black-owned business during Black History Month—coming on the heels of multiple accusations of racism against the company. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Tesla in September, accusing the company of tolerating anti-Black racism and retaliating against Black employees who spoke out. The suit claimed that in instances as early as 2015, non-Black employees at Tesla’s Fremont facility repeatedly used racial slurs. In April, Tesla paid a Black former employee $3.2 million after a federal jury in San Francisco ruled that the EV company did not condemn severe racial ha...",-2
San Jose bakery calls out Tesla for canceling order of thousands of pies,2024-02-23T21:31:03+00:00,https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/02/23/san-jose-bakery-calls-out-tesla-for-canceling-order-of-thousands-of-pies/,"Today's e-Edition Get Morning Report and other email newsletters  Get Morning Report and other email newsletters Today's e-Edition 
			Trending:		 When Voahangy Rasetarinera began The Giving Pies seven years ago out of her San Jose home kitchen, her mini pies became an instant hit with Stanford University students. Then corporate buyers like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon soon starting scooping them up, too. The companies ordered pies in the hundreds to the low thousands. So when another Silicon Valley giant – a representative from Tesla – called her on Valentine’s Day asking for 2,000 mini pies, Rasetarinera knew that she and her team could deliver. The Tesla rep asked for the pies to be ready for delivery on Feb. 20 and Feb. 22, said Rasetarinera. The next day, complications arose around the payment, and Rasetarinera became worried. Later that night, at around 9 o’ clock, however, the Tesla representative called to double the order to 4,000 mini pies, making the order among the largest ever handled by The Giving Pies, a fixture in the Willow Glen neighborhood since 2017. On Feb 16, Rasetarinera sent the revised invoice, asking for payment by noon, and the representative said she had “requested approval” by 11 a.m. When payment didn’t arrive, Rasetarina called but got no answer. Shortly after, the rep texted to tell her the order was canceled. The sudden change left her “reeling,” she said, comparing the move to a “break up … by text.” In order to fulfill the order, Rasetarinera had redirected staff to work Saturday and Sunday, and began buying special vegan ingredients and making pie crusts. She even turned down other orders. Between the ingredients and the time of her staff, the cancellation cost The Giving Pies some $2,000, according to the owner. The following week, she shared her story on social media in hopes others would understand the impact of the cancellation. “I wanted Tesla to understand that it’s not just frivolous:  it’s people’s lives that they are affecting and especially in this economy,” she said. The outpouring of support and attention that followed shocked her, with other small businesses offering to help sell any extra pies and community members sharing messages of solidarity. “What pies do you need to sell before they go bad. I’ll sell them at our store. I’ll market them for you… We are all in this together!!” said Tony & Alba’s Pizza and Pasta in a Facebook comment. Related Articles

San Jose bakery calls out Tesla for canceling order of thousands of pies,2024-02-23T21:31:03+00:00,https://www.siliconvalley.com/2024/02/23/san-jose-bakery-calls-out-tesla-for-canceling-order-of-thousands-of-pies/,"Today's E-Edition Morning Report in your inbox!  Morning Report in your inbox! Today's E-Edition When Voahangy Rasetarinera began The Giving Pies seven years ago out of her San Jose home kitchen, her mini pies became an instant hit with Stanford University students. Then corporate buyers like Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon soon starting scooping them up, too. The companies ordered pies in the hundreds to the low thousands. So when another Silicon Valley giant – a representative from Tesla – called her on Valentine’s Day asking for 2,000 mini pies, Rasetarinera knew that she and her team could deliver. The Tesla rep asked for the pies to be ready for delivery on Feb. 20 and Feb. 22, said Rasetarinera. The next day, complications arose around the payment, and Rasetarinera became worried. Later that night, at around 9 o’ clock, however, the Tesla representative called to double the order to 4,000 mini pies, making the order among the largest ever handled by The Giving Pies, a fixture in the Willow Glen neighborhood since 2017. On Feb 16, Rasetarinera sent the revised invoice, asking for payment by noon, and the representative said she had “requested approval” by 11 a.m. When payment didn’t arrive, Rasetarina called but got no answer. Shortly after, the rep texted to tell her the order was canceled. The sudden change left her “reeling,” she said, comparing the move to a “break up … by text.” In order to fulfill the order, Rasetarinera had redirected staff to work Saturday and Sunday, and began buying special vegan ingredients and making pie crusts. She even turned down other orders. Between the ingredients and the time of her staff, the cancellation cost The Giving Pies some $2,000, according to the owner. The following week, she shared her story on social media in hopes others would understand the impact of the cancellation. “I wanted Tesla to understand that it’s not just frivolous:  it’s people’s lives that they are affecting and especially in this economy,” she said. The outpouring of support and attention that followed shocked her, with other small businesses offering to help sell any extra pies and community members sharing messages of solidarity. “What pies do you need to sell before they go bad. I’ll sell them at our store. I’ll market them for you… We are all in this together!!” said Tony & Alba’s Pizza and Pasta in a Facebook comment. Related Articles

"Tesla-beating BYD and other Chinese carmakers using Mexico as back door poses ‘extinction-level’ threat to U.S. auto sector, warns trade group",2024-02-24T23:12:14+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/02/24/chinese-carmakers-evs-mexico-back-door-threat-american-automotive-sector/,"China has become a powerhouse in electric vehicles. Its automaker BYD recently topped Tesla in global EV sales, with Elon Musk warning of Chinese carmakers, “If there are no trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. They’re extremely good.” On Friday, the Alliance for American Manufacturing sounded the alarm, issuing a report entitled: “On a Collision Course: China’s Existential Threat to America’s Auto Industry and its Route Through Mexico.”  The report, which lists policy recommendations to combat overcapacity and unfair trade practices, notes that BYD is building factories in Thailand and Hungary designed to be regional export hubs. It then adds:  “More alarming, however, are Chinese firms’ heavy spending on plants in Mexico, through which they can access the United States by way of the more favorable tariffs under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This strategy is, in effect, an effort to gain backdoor access to American consumers by circumventing existing policies that are keeping China’s autos out of the U.S. market.” Read more: Trump says he’d hit cars made in Mexico by Chinese companies with 100% tariff, brushes off retaliation by Beijing: ‘You screw us and we’ll screw you’ In the U.S., made-in-China EVs are currently subject to a 25% tariff, which goes atop a 2.5% tariff on imported cars. That’s prevented them from making significant inroads. Manufacturing in Mexico, however, could change the equation. House lawmakers recently warned about China’s “industrial strategy to dominate the global automobile market” and its EV makers “gaining a back door to the U.S. market through our key trading partners.” Calling for existing tariffs on made-in-China cars to be maintained or even increased, they described a “coming wave” of Chinese vehicles that “will be exported from our other trading partners, such as Mexico.”  The Financial Times recently reported that Chinese carmakers including MG, BYD, and Chery have been scouting for manufacturing locations within Mexico. Meanwhile imports of Chinese cars into Mexico have been surging. While Musk credits Chinese EV makers for being “extremely good,” the Alliance for American Manufacturing focuses more on the government support they receive, writing: “Backstopped by heavy state support, Chinese automakers and suppliers have grown into industrial powerhouses that control the nodes of production for virtually the entire electric vehicle value chain.”  BYD, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, keeps its costs low partly by owning the entire supply chain of its EV batteries—significant since a battery accounts for roughly 40% of an electric vehicle’s price. “No one can match BYD on price. Period,” Michael Dunne, CEO of Asia-focused car consultancy Dunne Insights, recently told the Financial Times. “Boardrooms in America, Europe, Korea, and Japan are in a state of shock.” Ford CEO Jim Farley recently said that, to address the ...",-2
Elon Musk's Latest Robot Video Looks Like It Was Shot on a Phone From 2002,2024-02-24T20:58:44+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/elon-musks-latest-robot-video-looks-like-it-was-shot-on-1851284228,"Elon Musk has shared a new video on Saturday featuring Optimus, the robot Tesla has been working on since 2021. But anyone who tries to watch the video will immediately notice something weird. The clip of Optimus is so low quality and pixelated that it looks like it was shot on a flip-phone from two decades ago. The new video was posted in the early morning hours of Saturday and has been viewed over 35 million times as of this writing. But the video appears to show Optimus just walking around without doing much of anything. That would have been quite impressive around 2013 or so, since it’s relatively difficult to get machines to walk like humans, but it’s not entirely clear why Musk would want the world to see Optimus walking like this. Update, 3:58 p.m. ET: At some point in the past 30 minutes or so Elon Musk’s video was swapped out to include a higher resolution version. Curiously, tweets that have been edited will typically show a note at the bottom that says a tweet has been edited and the time it occurred, but Musk’s tweet doesn’t indicate anything has been changed.  The screenshots below show a side-by-side of what the tweet looked like before it was changed to include a higher resolution video. We’ve reached out to Twitter to see if Musk has special rules as owner of the social media platform and will update this post if we hear back. The rest of this post is being kept up for posterity. Incremental technical achievements aside, why does this video look so terrible? We weren’t the only ones to notice the bizarrely pixelated quality, as plenty of Musk fans made jokes about the blurriness. “Was this filmed with a potato?” one user quipped. “Same photographer?” another X user quipped with a photo of Bigfoot. Tesla didn’t immediately respond to questions about this new video of Optimus emailed Saturday. Musk unveiled Optimus with an unconventional presentation in the summer of 2021 that really felt like the billionaire was desperate to hype virtually anything futuristic. Tesla’s AI Day that year didn’t feature a real robot, but rather someone dressed in a white and black suit moving around like a stereotypical robot before starting to dance a jig. Tesla’s robot has made progress since that first jokey unveiling, but Optimus still has quite a ways to go before it can catch up to the most cutting edge robots of the 2020s. Atlas, a humanoid robot made by Boston Dynamics, started learning how to pick itself up in 2016, standing on one leg that same year, doing backflips in 2017, and achieved parkour-style jumping in 2018.  And Atlas is still making progress in ways that rival how humans actually move. Last year, the Atlas robot showed off its ability to manipulate its environment to navigate complex worksites. Optimus has made improvements since it was first announced but it has quite a ways to go if it wants to catch up to a company like Boston Dynamics. Arguably the most impressive thing we’ve seen Optimus do is fold laundry, but if you take a ...",-2
"Tesla asked to start construction of Mexican factory 'in March at the latest' as Elon Musk frets about high interest rates, global economy",2024-02-24T20:20:50+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/02/24/tesla-mexico-factory-elon-musk-cheaper-evs-interest-rates-economy/,"Nuevo Leon Governor Samuel Garcia has asked Tesla Inc. to announce the start of construction soon of its planned factory in the Mexican state, national newspaper El Financiero reported. “I asked Tesla to come by in March at the latest to make an announcement around laying the first stone and they didn’t tell me no,” Garcia said Saturday during the inauguration of a recreational project in the area of the La Huasteca ecological park in Santa Catarina, where Tesla plans to build its factory. “I hope that very soon, in less than a month, the company will come,” he said. Read more: Tesla-beating BYD and other Chinese carmakers using Mexico as back door poses ‘extinction-level’ threat to U.S. auto sector, warns trade group Construction of the Nuevo Leon factory, which had been slated to make Tesla’s cheaper next-generation vehicles, has been delayed due to Elon Musk’s misgivings about the global economy. Other problems, including permitting delays and a dearth of infrastructure, also have plagued the process. Tesla plans to build a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle at the gigafactory, helped in part by $153 million in local government incentives. Musk requested last year that Nuevo Leon improve electricity, water and transportation in the region before it starts construction. Musk said in October he wasn’t ready to go “full tilt” on the facility because of high interest rates. He also said that Tesla will produce its next-generation entry level vehicle in its Texas factory before its Mexican facility since the new plant won’t be ready in time. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

'Next Tesla' EV startups struggle as demand sags and once-bullish investors flee: 'Whoever finds a sponsor has the best chance',2024-02-24T15:51:17+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/02/24/next-tesla-ev-startups-struggle-as-investors-flee/,"There was a time when the backing of some of the world’s deepest pockets and the mere ambition to sell electric cars was enough to inspire confidence in the stocks of upstarts Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. Now investors have all but thrown in the towel on the shares. All it took was a fresh dose of reality from the two companies this week around cooling demand for EVs. Rivian, which makes electric pickups, SUVs and delivery vans and counts Amazon.com Inc. as its top shareholder, said its production will stay flat at last year’s levels. It also announced plans to shrink its workforce again. Lucid, majority-owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, projected only a slight increase in output over 2023. Both forecasts fell far short of analysts’ expectations. For investors, the sense of gloom has been building since October, when Tesla Inc. warned of sagging interest in EVs. Though shares of the EV giant have fared poorly since then, losing around 20% and massively underperforming the broader market, the impact on smaller rivals like Rivian and Lucid has been nothing short of disastrous. Read more: Tesla has chance to ‘grow their market share even more’ thanks to EV startups faltering and legacy automakers focusing on hybrids  “If you are a hyper-growth company in what is seen as a disruptive industry and you are not growing your topline, you are in trouble,” said David Mazza, chief strategy officer at Roundhill Investments. “Having an anchor investor like Amazon or the Saudis gives them a longer runway from a capital perspective, but their growth will still be slower and margins thinner than what was once expected.” Shares of Irvine, California-based Rivian are down by about 44% since Tesla’s October warning — the first in a series of grim outlooks from global EV-makers and suppliers — and closed Friday at a record low. Newark, California-based Lucid has dropped some 33% in the same period, and isn’t far above its own nadir.  Still, had it not been for their wealthy backers — Amazon has a 17% stake in Rivian, and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund holds roughly 60% of Lucid, data compiled by Bloomberg show — the stocks could be looking far uglier.  “The presence of these names is a comfort to investors and a cushion to the price,” Mazza said. “If these stocks were just relying on the EV hype, then they will be down much worse.” Amazon in an emailed statement said that the recent results from Rivian don’t change anything about the e-commerce company’s “existing investment, collaboration, or order size and timing.” Rivian has a deal with Amazon to sell it 100,000 electric delivery vans by 2030. Saudi Arabia’s PIF didn’t respond to an email seeking comment outside of the fund’s regular business hours on Friday. Overall, the biggest concern is that these cash-burning, unprofitable companies will struggle to sell cars at a time when even industry-leader Tesla — by far the biggest seller in the US market — is cutting prices to boost ...",-3

SFPD Suspects An Arsonist Is Targeting Teslas After Two Catch on Fire in SoMa,2024-02-25T19:35:03+00:00,https://sfist.com/2024/02/25/sfpd-suspects-an-arsonist-is-targeting-teslas-after-two-catch-on-fire-in-soma/,"Police are investigating after they discovered two Teslas on fire within a few blocks of each other in San Francisco’s SoMa neighborhood on Saturday morning.  The fire department responded to the first fire around 1 a.m. at Shipley and Fourth streets, and the second vehicle fire at Mabini and Bonifacio streets shortly after, per the Chronicle. Both cars were reportedly Tesla Model Y’s. One of the Tesla owners, only identified as “Chris,” told the Chronicle that all that was left in the spot he parked in — which was right outside his home — was a pile of char and some scrap metal, because police had apparently towed the car immediately. He says that the police didn’t show him a picture of his car. Police reportedly told the owner that they were reviewing nearby surveillance footage to find more evidence, but they suspect arson in the two car fires, due to the similarities in the crimes. (Although spontaneous Tesla fires aren't unheard of.) Still, spokespeople for the police and fire departments declined to comment on the investigation. Meanwhile, Chris said that he was “shocked” by the event in the “normally very safe neighborhood.” There have been a total of 37 individual arson incidents since the begiinnngin of the year, according to SFPD crime data (including the recent immolation of a self-driving car).  Feature image via Unsplash/Tyler Casey. A neighborhood in San Pablo was under a lockdown this morning; a Target store in Vallejo has been closed down after an arson incident; and BART set a new post-pandemic ridership record on Saturday. It's a busy weekend, with the Lunar New Year Parade and Pro-Ukraine March taking place in SF Saturday, and the Black Joy Parade on Sunday in Oakland; plus, the SFPD officially approved a policy to reduce racially biased pretexts in police stops.

			Trending:		 SAN JOSE — Tesla has offered to reimburse thousands of dollars that a San Jose bakery lost when the electric vehicle maker abruptly canceled a huge order of mini pies without explanation, the store’s owner says. The Giving Pies, a fixture in San Jose’s Willow Glen district, has become a small-business David going up against a corporate Goliath that now appears to have shifted gears into full mea culpa mode after the tech titan’s order cancellation that left the local merchant in a financial squeeze. “I got contacted by Tesla to cater two of their events on March 5 and 7 for 1,800 pies each day, individually wrapped,”  Voahangy Rasetarinera, owner of The Giving Pies, said in an email she sent to this news organization. “They also offered to pay the $2,000 loss that I experienced because of the cancellation.” Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk entered the fray after the corporate behemoth encountered a firestorm of disdain due to the company’s cancellation of the huge order of mini pies. “Just hearing about this,” Musk stated in a tweet on Feb. 23. “Will make things good with the bakery.” At the time of the tweet, Tesla wasn’t offering any specifics as to how the company would accomplish a “make good” for the canceled order. Until now, apparently. “I was really surprised that it had reached him,” Rasetarinera said in the emailed comments, referring to the unexpected turn of events that caused the controversy to wind up on the radar screen of Musk, one of the world’s wealthiest captains of industry.

Italy has been trying to woo Tesla-beating BYD as the second auto giant on its shores,2024-02-26T22:06:41+00:00,https://fortune.com/europe/2024/02/26/italy-approaches-byd-manufacture-electric-vehicles/,"BYD Co. has been contacted by the Italian government as part of the country’s efforts to attract a second car manufacturer beyond Fiat maker Stellantis NV.  “We have some contacts to discuss about that,” Michael Shu, managing director of BYD Europe, said in an interview at the Geneva International Motor Show. The Chinese company considered a number of countries for its first European plant, before eventually choosing a site in Hungary.  Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government has plans to attract a new major carmaker to Italy after Stellantis signaled it may move some production to lower-cost countries. Manufacturers are under pressure to become more efficient in the EV transition with battery vehicle prices still far higher than equivalent combustion-engine cars. BYD, which overtook Tesla Inc. as the world’s biggest EV maker last year, in December confirmed it’ll build a factory in Hungary to help boost sales in the region. The manufacturer is focusing on Hungary and it’s too soon to say when and if a decision will be made on a second site, Shu said.  Asked about BYD, Industry Minister Adolfo Urso said Tuesday on the sidelines of an event in the southern city of Taranto that he hopes Italy would be like other European nations with several car-makers producing on its soil to “strengthen” the country’s automotive supply chain, according to comments cited by newswire AGI.   Urso said earlier this month that Italy “backed the arrival” of a second producer, calling it “a project we have been working on for months with meaningful talks with foreign partners.” BYD’s new plant in Hungary is raising the stakes for Europe’s domestic carmakers, particularly for Volkswagen, Stellantis and Renault that also serve the competitive mass-market segment. News of the investment in Hungary comes a few months after the European Union announced a probe into state subsidies to Chinese EV makers, and could help the company avoid any additional import tariffs. The manufacturer has been cooperating in the investigation, Shu said. “We have strong products and technology and supply-chain management flexibility,” he said. “Based on facts, I don’t think” the company’s success in Europe “is coming from subsidies.” © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

MWC 2024: This 5G E-Bike Borrows Tesla-Style ADAS Tech For Safer Riding,2024-02-26T21:35:28+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1526671/orbic-5g-e-bike-tesla-style-adas-mwc-2024/,"
Orbic, which makes a wide range of consumer electronics gadgets, is now looking at the electric bike segment. At MWC 2024, the company has revealed what it calls a 5G eBike, which also happens to be the first in the world to rely on AI-assisted object detection. ""Orbic's new technology actively monitors the rear surroundings of the eBike and alerts riders to potential hazards, such as oncoming vehicles,"" says the company.





For world sensing, the company equipped the e-bike with a 2-megapixel camera sensor at the rear that covers a 140-degree field of view to offer real-time world awareness. In addition to surveillance, this sensor ties in with the onboard video and audio systems, sending visual and sound cues as safety measures.

SlashGear

Orbic's approach, despite being a meaningfully novel addition for an electric bike, follows in the controversial footsteps of Tesla. The Elon Musk-led car company decided to remove radar sensors from its electric cars back in 2021 in favor of cameras. Tesla has been quite bullish about the vision-based intelligence for its advanced driver assist system (ADAS), which includes both Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD).





Tesla received some flak for the move due to well-known shortcomings of cameras for ADAS implementation, but the company is quite bullish on its tech stack and is even building one of the world's most powerful supercomputers to handle tasks like image data labeling. As for Orbic's e-bike, the vision-based sensing and safety alert system is an impressive achievement.

Tesla Model 3 Plaid: This Is It,2024-02-26T18:40:00+00:00,https://jalopnik.com/tesla-model-3-plaid-this-is-it-1851286686,"The car company with a performance trim named after a throw-away joke from every 13-year-old’s favorite Mel Brooks film is apparently expanding its EV performance lineup downward with a new Model 3 Plaid on the docket. The Model S Plaid proved no match for Porsche’s Taycan or Lucid’s Air Sapphire on track. As a result, maybe Tesla has taken a page out of the muscle car handbook, putting the big motor from the big car into the small car to go fast. For a company that claims to not have a PR department, Tesla’s PR department works awfully hard. This short (and clearly cleverly orchestrated by Tesla) video posted to social media over the weekend depicting the new Tesla Model 3 Plaid trundling through a small square in Valencia, Spain, is the proof. The car isn’t even wearing real license plates, just a three-dimensional badge that says Model 3 like it might for a manufacturer photo shoot. Spanish police aren’t going to let something without a plate drive around willy nilly.  Tesla hasn’t officially recognized that this car exists, though it has dropped some pretty big hints. Obviously as the Model 3 lineup currently lacks a performance variant, we knew one was coming soon, but to see it in production-ready guise wearing a Plaid badge means Tesla is getting serious about it. What do we know about it so far?  The current Model S and Model X Plaid models make an eye-watering 1,020 horsepower from a trio of electric motors, capable of pushing the just-shy-of-5000-pounds S sedan from zero to sixty in 2.1 seconds. The current Model 3 dual motor weighs around 800 pounds lighter than the Model S Plaid, though it makes do with just 394 horsepower of thrust. That’s hardly good enough to make Spaceball One go Ludicrous Speed, and Dark Helmet will not be pleased. It doesn’t seem likely that Tesla will have enough room in the recently-updated Model 3 for a third motor or the associated cooling gubbins.  In order to be worthy of the Plaid badge, the Model S required a 350 horsepower bump from the standard Model S Dual Motor’s 670 to the Model S Plaid’s 1,020. It isn’t feasible to fit 1020 horsepower worth of motors in the smaller Model 3, or nearly double the Dual Motor’s electric ponies. This is all speculation, but Edmunds is placing their bet at 550 horsepower. I don’t think that will be enough to sate Mr. Musk’s appetite for meme-induced power. I’m going to wager the Model 3 Plaid will make at least 650 horsepower in order to earn the Spaceballs-inspired badge.  Based on the spy video of the Model 3 Plaid driving around, the car has a reworked front fascia with an eye toward aerodynamic downforce, and a new diffuser out the back. The car sits lower, and more purposeful on a black set of directional five-spoke aero wheels. It’s difficult to say if the brake package is larger than on the standard Model 3 from the short video, but they look pretty purposeful.  The current Model 3 Dual Motor is capable of running from 0-60 in 4.2 seconds, and the discontinued Mod...",3

			Trending:		 A man was shot in the shoulder near the Newport Beach pier following a report of road rage and was released from a hospital following treatment Wednesday morning, Feb. 28, authorities said. Newport Beach police received a call of shots fired in a parking lot in the 2100 block of West Oceanfront Walk about 12:15 a.m., Sgt. Steve Oberon said. A short time later, a man driving a Tesla SUV flagged down officers in the area of San Joaquin Hills and Jamboree roads. The man was found with a gunshot wound and was taken to a hospital by paramedics, Oberon said. The sergeant said the Tesla’s driver pulled up next to a parked dark-colored sedan with four males standing next to it following the reported road rage. They argued before one of the men pulled a gun from his waistband and fired five times at the SUV, hitting the driver once. Further details about what type of road rage occurred and what led to it were not known. Police did not have suspect information nor further information about the suspects’ car. Video from the OnSceneTV showed investigators looking at a dark-colored Tesla SUV parked at a Shell gas station that appeared to have been struck in the rear by bullets. Anyone with information about the shooting was urged to call Newport Beach police at 949-644-3681. Copyright © 2024 MediaNews Group",0

Should I Buy an Electric School Bus?,2024-02-28T21:58:48+00:00,https://stnonline.com/blogs/should-i-buy-an-electric-school-bus/,"Last month, images and news headlines of Teslas being stranded in Chicago and not charging in extremely cold weather caught many people’s attention on the merit of owning or buying an electric car. The lack of working charging stations and dead batteries were reported as the root cause. Will this negative news shake consumer confidence in electric vehicles? It depends on where you live. Also, access to a large amount of working charging stations seems to be paramount. How important is infrastructure? Many industry professionals believe this is the key factor in the whole process of adding electric school buses to a fleet. Electric school buses are going through an initial growth spurt due to the influx of funding from federal, state and local programs plus mounting environmental regulations. The market for electric school buses has been predominately in New York and California, but that scope is expanding rapidly. In mid-January, the EPA announced the winners of nearly $965 million in competitive grant funding for larger-scale adoptions of zero and low-emissions school buses. This amounts to 2,675 more electric school buses across 36 states. Additionally, the EPA made the decision to extend the application period for the Clean School Bus Program rebates to Feb. 14. The cited reason is stakeholders have said they need more time “to appropriately engage with partners like utilities and school boards ahead of submitting an application.” The rebate will offer at least $500 million for the purchase of CNG, electric and propane school buses as well as necessary fueling infrastructure.EPA said it expects to notify rebate winners in April. Last month, I also attended the National School Transportation Association (NSTA) Midwinter Meeting in Florida. I had the opportunity to sit in on a panel discussion hosted by NSTA Executive Director Curt Macysyn called, “What’s the latest in the EV movement?” The panel of companies represented included Blue Bird, BYD/RIDE, IC Bus, Lion Electric, Thomas Built Buses and Zenobe, a battery solutions manufacturer and financier. My big takeaway was working with your local public utility is critical to the speed in which an operation can add and scale electric school buses. The panel also discussed the long-term pricing outlook and agreed across the board that electric school bus prices will remain at the current levels for some time. Jason Yan from BYD/RIDE shared his insights from the company’s work in the transit bus industry, for which it is one of the world’s largest manufacturers. He said he has seen improvements in battery chemistry and energy density with consistent year over year performance and range enhancements on buses. I drew the conclusion that school buses will experience a similar outcome with all the R&D from OEMs. What does this mean for our industry when extreme weather strikes again? Should this be a major factor in your decision-making process before adding electric school buses to your fleet? Consider ...",-1
"Elon Musk Reveals Major New Updates On Tesla Roadster, Including When You Can Get One",2024-02-28T18:32:25+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1528523/new-tesla-roadster-update-launch-delivery-details/,"
Elon Musk is once again making big promises. Earlier today, the tech CEO took to X, formally Twitter, to unveil that ”We [Tesla] radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster.” He exclaimed that ”there will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car.” Musk noted that the new Roadster is the result of a collaboration between Tesla and spacecraft manufacturer SpaceX.






Tonight, we radically increased the design goals for the new Tesla Roadster.
There will never be another car like this, if you could even call it a car.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 28, 2024



Replying to one X user, Musk stated that the new Roadster can go 0-60 in less than a second. He also noted that the new electric sports car would be unveiled at the end of the year, in what he thinks could be ""the most mind-blowing product demo of all time."" According to Musk, Telsa plans to ship the car in 2025.
However, outside of Musk's social media announcement, there haven't been any official statements from Tesla or SpaceX about the supposed changes to the project. And those who have been following Musk for a long time know that his promises should be taken with a grain of salt. This is especially the case when it comes to the Roadster.

In 2015, the CEO stated that a faster roadster was on its way, arriving in four years. A prototype was eventually unveiled in late 2017, with promises of a 2020 release. After being delayed again in 2022, it is still nowhere to be found. Musk's track record of not making good on his release date promises can make even the biggest Musk superfan skeptical of hi...",-1

In Norway, 82.4% of vehicles sold in 2023 were fully electric. So much for the idea that electric vehicles are falling out of favor and don’t work in cold climates. (The short answer about driving electric in cold weather: charge before you go.) The top-selling cars there last year were the Tesla Model Y, the Volkswagen ID.4, the Skoda Enyaq, the Toyota bZ4X, the Volvo XC40, and the Ford Mustang Mach-E. All of these battery-powered fully electric cars, except the Skoda, are available here in the United States. With so many fully electric vehicles (EVs) to choose from — and many more affordable models on the way — American car buyers are now starting to ask important questions as they shop for their next ride. Transportation experts and policymakers have done careful scientific studies and concluded that battery electric vehicles are better for our environment and society. That’s why our federal government has enacted laws to provide $7,500 rebates, and many states provide additional incentives, to encourage consumers to drive electric. Everyone understands and agrees that fully electric vehicles emit no tailpipe emissions, unlike hybrids and fuel-powered vehicles. That prevents pollution where it really matters — in our driveways and neighborhood streets where our families breathe. However, some people wonder about emissions at remote power plants that generate the electricity used to charge EVs. The good news is that households are installing solar on their garages, carports, home roofs, or in their yards to generate the electricity to charge their EVs. But even grid power is getting cleaner: in 2023, the United States nationally generated 4,178 terawatt hours of electricity, 16% from coal, and 21% from renewables (hydro, wind, and solar). The share of coal-powered electricity is heading toward zero as a lot more solar is scheduled to come online in the next decade. People also wonder about the environmental impact of manufacturing batteries, especially the materials in battery electrodes. Car starter batteries, which have been manufactured since the early 1900s, use electrodes made from lead, an extremely heavy and toxic material. We have minimized the environmental impact of that dubious material choice by carefully recycling lead.Advertisement Many different kinds of battery electrodes are being commercialized for EVs to provide faster charging and longer ranges. Some electrode reci...",2

			Trending:		 Owners of Ford electric vehicles can now use much of Tesla’s charging network in the U.S. and Canada, but there’s a hitch. They’ll need to get an adapter that Ford will provide for free, although the company won’t start shipping those until the end of March. Last May, Ford became the first automaker to reach an agreement with the Austin, Texas-based Tesla to charge on its network, which is the largest and most well-placed in the U.S. Tesla has more than 26,000 plugs and nearly 2,400 Supercharger stations across the U.S. and Canada. Ford said its owners will have access to about 15,000 Tesla fast-charging plugs that are located strategically along travel corridors. Ford owners won’t be able to use some older Tesla plugs. Most other automakers followed Ford in joining Tesla’s network and agreeing to switch to Tesla’s plug, called the North American Charging Standard, which is smaller and easier to use than the current plugs on most other EVs sold in the two countries. Ford said adding the Tesla plugs will double the size of the network that can be used by Ford EV owners. There are nearly 166,000 Ford EVs in the U.S. Ken Williams, director of charging and energy services, said a top concern of its EV owners is charging, even though they charge 80% of the time at home. “We wanted to make sure we are meeting that need,” he said. Ford is offering the adapters for free to the owners, who can sign up on the Ford.com website to reserve them between Thursday and June 30. The company will provide one free adapter per vehicle. Tesla’s network was turned on Wednesday morning, and software enabling the Ford vehicles to charge at Tesla stations was to be sent out around the same time. Ford will switch to Tesla’s charging connector with its second-generation EVs starting next year. Customers will pay Tesla for the electricity, and Williams said they can find out the price at Ford’s mobile app and on public charging apps on vehicle touch screens.

As a Black native of San Francisco, she’s watched her city change as rich tech workers move in, housing prices skyrocket and entire communities — and Black communities in particular — are pushed out. All of that goes into “Dirty White Teslas Make Me Sad,” her new play now playing at San Francisco’s Magic Theatre, presented by the Magic and Campo Santo. Described in the press release as “a living poem and a prayer,” the play follows a Black San Franciscan seeking some kind of salvation on the eve of losing her home in the Bayview-Hunters Point neighborhood. “Watching this hyper-erasure of everything I thought I knew about the city and everything I recognized was the first spark,” says Smiley, 34. “And then the creeping influx of white Teslas. They were spotted here and there, and then all of a sudden they were flooding the streets at the same time that we were seeing this hyper-gentrification and rise of houselessness and erasure and omission of native San Franciscans, not just in terms of who was able to afford to live here, but also who was actually being listened to and prioritized when it came to major decisions in the city.” “Dirty White Teslas” is Smiley’s first full-length play. “I woke up one day and found out that I was kicking off the Magic Theatre’s 2024 season,” she marvels. “I really don’t know what to do with myself now. What do you do when the dream comes true? Now I’ve got to figure out a whole new dream.” Smiley has been deep into theater since she was a kid growing up in San Francisco. “I got bit by the bug when I got to be the Major General in my fifth-grade production of ‘Pirates of Penzance,’ she recalls.

Ovaj put primljena je dojava o eksplozivnim napravama u dva putnička aviona, ali je bezbednosnom proverom ustanovljeno je da je u pitanju lažna uzbuna. Prema navodima agencije Tanjug, dojava je primljena oko 14.10, dok su letelice bile spremne da prime putnike. Kontradiverzione ekipe sprovele su hitnu proveru koja je utvrđena strogim procedurama.

Aero.rs nezvanično saznaje da su se dojave odnosile na avion koji je na letu LH1407 trebalo da preveze putnike za Frankfurt (FRA), kao i o avionu poljske kompanije koji je letom LO572 trebalo da preveze putnike u Varšavu (WAW). Oba vazduhoplova zabeležila su višesatna zakašnjenja: Embraer E175 poljskog avio-prevoznika odleteo je za Varšavu u 16.51, dok je Lufthansin A320neo napustio pistu beogradskog aerodroma tek u 18.15. Da podsetimo, aerodromi u Beogradu i Podgorici juče naveče bili su zatvoreni za saobraćaj zbog prijava o postavljenim bombama u avionima.

Germany: Tesla plant protesters to spend week in forest,2024-03-01T19:12:00+00:00,https://www.dw.com/en/germany-tesla-plant-protesters-to-spend-week-in-forest/a-68422841?maca=en-rss-en-top-1022-rdf,"Treehouses and a piano concert in the woods: Activists protesting against a Tesla factory expansion near Berlin said they intend to stay in a forest for a week. The police keep a low profile. Environmental activists protesting the expansion of US electric carmaker Tesla's factory outside Berlin said they plan to occupy the forest near the factory for a week.  ""The longer the occupation lasts, the better,"" a spokeswoman for the ""Stop Tesla"" initiative said Friday. The occupation of the wooded area in Grünheide, near Berlin, began late on Wednesday night. The protesters have built around a dozen treehouses several meters above the ground. On Friday morning, in addition to the 50 to 70 activists from the ""Stop Tesla"" initiative and the ""Robin Wood"" group, only two police officers were visible, according to regional public broadcaster rbb.  The initiative urged other supporters to visit the camp and bring additional materials like wood, saws, climbing gear and hammocks. A walk through the forest in protest of Tesla and a piano concert in the forest are also planned for Saturday afternoon, activists said. The protesters said their goal is to prevent the clearing of the forest for a Tesla expansion project. The electric car maker wants to build a freight station, warehouses and a company kindergarten next to the existing 300-hectare factory site. More than 100 hectares of forest would have to be cleared.  In February, a majority of Grünheide residents voted against the current expansion plans in a nonbinding poll. Tesla then announced further talks on the issue. ""We are open to dialogue, but we will not be forced out of the forest,"" said a spokesman for the protest group, which is supported by a local citizens' initiative. Police said they see no reason to dismantle the camp in the forest, adding that they are monitoring events there. The protest in the pine forest can continue until March 15, according to a police decision. An extension is possible and the police are also preparing for long-term protests, a police spokesperson told rbb on Thursday. Tesla has not yet commented on the protest camp near the factory.

Lawyers that successfully argued Musk’s $56B Tesla pay package was excessive seek jaw-dropping $6B fee,2024-03-02T20:58:33+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/02/business/lawyers-that-successfully-argued-musks-56b-tesla-pay-package-was-excessive-seek-jaw-dropping-6b-fee/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Attorneys who successfully argued that Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package was excessive are demanding a Delaware judge award them nearly $6 billion.  If granted, the legal eagles’ jaw-dropping payday — which they are asking to be paid in the electric car-maker’s stock — would shatter previous records for attorneys fees. “We recognize that the requested fee is unprecedented in terms of absolute size,” the three law firms said in a filing in Delaware’s Court of Chancery requesting the fee. The proposed fee translates to an hourly rate of $288,888, they noted.  Elon Musk slammed the attorneys’ proposed award as “criminal,” writing on his social media platform X that the “lawyers who did nothing but damage Tesla want $6 billion.” The legal team represented Tesla stockholder Richard Tornetta, a onetime drummer for Philadelphia-based thrash band Dawn of Correction, who in 2018 sued Musk over his princely pay package.  The suit, brought by Tornetta on behalf of his fellow stockholders, alleged Musk ultimately controlled the approval process to determine the conditions of his compensation package and that the board misled investors who ultimately voted on the CEO’s windfall.  In January, Judge Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery ruled in favor of the suit in voiding Musk’s pay package, deeming his compensation “an unfathomable sum” that was awarded through a “deeply flawed” process.   The lawyers argued Tesla should pay their eye-popping fee because the vehicle maker benefited from their win, which would see the return of 266 million shares to the electric carmaker.  Tesla stock closed Friday at $202.62, meaning that block of shares is worth about $53.9 billion.  “This structure has the benefit of linking the award directly to the benefit created and avoids taking even 1 cent from the Tesla balance sheet to pay fees,” the lawyers wrote. They noted the fee would be tax-deductible. The previous record for the largest legal fee was $688 million, awarded in 2008 to lawyers who won a $7.2 billion settlement in a securities fraud case over the collapse of Enron Corp. Musk is currently the richest man in the world, worth $215 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  He is expected to appeal the ruling and has said he is looking to transfer Tesla’s site of incorporation from Delaware, which about 70% of major companies call home, to Texas following the suit. He moved SpaceX’s incorporation to Texas two weeks ago.  Three law firms represented the Tesla shareholders in the suit: Bernstein Litowitz Berger and Grossmann, and Friedman Oster and Tejtel, both of New York; and Andrews and Springer of Wilmington, DE.  With Post wires.

Lawyers who said Elon Musk was overpaid want nearly $6 billion in fees,2024-03-02T19:46:00+00:00,https://timesofmalta.com/article/lawyers-said-elon-musk-overpaid-want-nearly-6-billion-fees.1087324,"The lawyers of a Tesla shareholder who helped void Elon Musk's enormous 2018 compensation package have asked a court in the US state of Delaware for nearly $6 billion in legal fees, paid in company shares. In a filing Friday with the Delaware Chancery Court, the three legal firms acknowledged the unprecedented size of the fees they are requesting but argued that winning the case in January provided ""enormous benefits"" to the carmaker. ""The size of the requested award is great because the value of the benefit to Tesla that Plaintiff's Counsel achieved was massive,"" the firms said. The court in January approved the annulment of Musk's 2018 enormous compensation agreement worth $55.8 billion, siding with Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta, who claimed Musk was overpaid. The firms asked the court for reimbursement of costs incurred, which they estimate at $1.12 million, as well as 29.4 million Tesla shares, which were listed at $202.64 per share at the close of Wall Street on Friday.  In an unusual request, the firms want the entire amount, $5.96 billion at today's price, to be paid in Tesla shares. This would represent a little under 1 percent of Tesla's total capital but would place the firms, combined, among Tesla's 10 largest shareholders. When contacted by AFP, the law firms and Tesla did not immediately respond. In her ruling, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen McCormick said the process of approving Musk's compensation was ""deeply flawed."" In response, the South Africa-born billionaire asked Tesla shareholders to support a transfer of the company's registration from Delaware to Texas.   You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of our emails.

Apple buying Rivian? Nissan with Fisker? Tesla rivals’ woes spark speculation,2024-03-03T20:17:26+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/03/03/electric-vehicles-apple-rivian-nissan-fisker-tesla-rivals-speculation/,"Tesla rivals Rivian, Lucid, and Fisker were riding high a few years ago. Amid surging investor interest, the electric-vehicle makers commanded hefty market caps and spoke of bright futures. Things look far less promising today. The EV sector faces a growth slowdown, and even market leader Tesla has warned of challenging months ahead. For its less-established rivals, “challenging” doesn’t quite cover it. Last month, Rivian announced a disappointing quarter and outlook and said it would cut its salaried workforce by roughly 10%. Its market cap has plunged to $11 billion from a 2021 peak of $153 billion. Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, addressed the idea this week of Apple—which recently canned its own EV project—buying Rivian, noting the low valuation. Apple “needs to break into some new market,” he told CNBC. “They need to do something big, and potentially Rivian would be just the answer to that.” Of course, that would be an unusual move for Apple. Its most expensive acquisition to date was $3 billion for headphone maker Beats Electronics in 2014. Amazon, which buys delivery vans from Rivian, is the EV maker’s largest shareholder, with about 16% of its hard-hit shares.  Last month, Musk said of Rivian, “They need to cut costs massively, and the exec team needs to live in the factory or they will die.” He suggested the company had about six quarters before going bankrupt. Read more: Ex-Ford CEO warns of ‘real financial trouble’ for EV startups as adoption takes longer than expected Lucid, meanwhile, has seen its market cap plummet from a peak of $91.4 billion in 2001 to a $7.6 billion today. Last month, it said it would build only about 9,000 EVs this year—far below the 90,000 it predicted for 2024 three years ago. Its struggles led to speculation last year that Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, which holds about 60% of the EV maker, would acquire the rest of it. That didn’t happen. As for Fisker, its market cap stands at $258 million, down from $4.1 billion in 2021. Last month, it received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange for noncompliance as its stock closed at under $1 on average for 30 trading days consecutively. And the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating claims of “unintended vehicle movement” in Fisker’s Ocean SUV, which recently received a much-watched poor review from influential YouTuber Marques Brownlee (aka MKBHD). Read more: Tesla challenger Fisker, flirting with bankruptcy, gets both a design award and another scathing review in the same week Reuters, citing unnamed sources, reported this week that the Fisker is in advanced talks with Nissan about a partnership—and a financial lifeline. Under the deal, the Japanese automaker would invest $400 million in Fisker’s truck platform and build its planned Alaska pickup starting in 2026. “I believe that we have a future—otherwise I wouldn’t be here,” Fisker CEO Henrik Fisker told Yahoo Finance this week, declining to addre...",-3

Tesla Cybertruck Crashes Into the Beverly Hills Hotel Sign,2024-03-04T23:48:35+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/tesla-cybertruck-crashes-into-the-beverly-hills-hotel-s-1851307260,"This story originally appeared on Jalopnik.  If you follow social media, you’ll know that there have been more than a few crashes and fender benders involving the Tesla Cybertruck. Yet another such crash happened in Beverly Hills last night, reportedly involving the actual owner of the truck. We came across the incident on Twitter X. A user by the name of @jackdidthat tweeted that the valet at the Beverly Hills Hotel had crashed their friend’s Cybertruck along with a picture of the truck after the incident; it appears to have crashed into a wall right below the Beverly Hills Hotel entrance sign. This person was also weirdly reaching out to Elon Musk in the same tweet asking if he could help his friend get another truck. It turns out that wasn’t exactly the case. InsideEV reports that the owner of the truck was actually the one responsible for the crash although they didn’t exactly say how they learned this information. No matter who cause the crash, the outcome does not look good. If you look closely at the picture from the scene, you can see that the front passenger wheel is off, likely due to how high the wall is near the sign. There’s really no other details right now other than what we can see on social media. If this was caused by the owner, it’s a pretty shitty (and pointless) move to try and point the finger at an innocent valet. It will also be interesting to learn just how the hell the crash happened in the first place. User error? Malfunction? We’ll be sure to keep an eye out for more details as they become available. ",-2

Are the Waymo and Tesla Arsonists the Same Person?,2024-03-04T21:18:07+00:00,https://sfist.com/2024/03/04/are-the-waymo-and-tesla-arsonists-the-same-person/,"The SFPD has reportedly made an arrest in connection with the arson of an autonomous Waymo taxi in Chinatown last month, and they say the suspect is linked to other vehicle arson cases. It's been a while since San Francisco had a prolific carsonist about town, but there could be one in our midst again — or, at least, the SFPD says they have such a suspect in custody. The department released surveillance footage last week of a suspect lighting a parked Tesla on fire in SF's SoMa district on February 24, one of two that was torched that same night.   And now, as the SF Standard confirms with police, they have a suspect in custody connected with the Waymo car set on fire amid Lunar New Year celebrations in Chinatown two weeks earlier. We don't yet have a suspect name, but police reportedly said that they arrested a man on February 27 near Union Square who was suspected of lighting ""several"" cars on fire. The suspect also allegedly had methamphetamine on his person at the time of the arrest. The SFPD has not yet linked the Waymo arson with the two Teslas set on fire, but the media was already making that connection last week, including the LA Times, and SFGate. Two days after the Chinatown Waymo incident, Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin told reporters that the SFPD already had ""promising leads"" on suspects in the case, though we did not hear anything further in the weeks that followed. The Tesla fires occurred within a block of each other on February 24. The arsonist was caught on video putting some paper on top of the tire of a parked Model Y near the intersection of Shipley and Fourth streets, and then lighting it, and the car subsequently went up in flames. The other fire occurred shortly before that near Bonafacio and Mabini streets — alleyways between Third and Fourth streets, south of Folsom.

"Tesla Cybertruck Crashed Into Beverly Hills Hotel By Valet, Elon Weighs In",2024-03-04T19:22:04+00:00,https://www.tmz.com/2024/03/04/tesla-cybertruck-crash-beverly-hills-hotel-wheel-rip-off-elon/,"update 11:57 AM PT -- A rep for the Dorchester Collection -- the company that owns The Beverly Hills Hotel, among others -- tells TMZ ... none of its valets had anything to do with this crash, despite speculation. This is true, incident happened around 2am and I drafted up this joke of a tweet with employees of the valet and hotel. Not thinking it would blow up, we thought it would be funny to say it was valet and not our friend who just crashed his new cybertruck... BHH is not at fault! https://t.co/HBp0ow0rRk We're told the Cybertruck just happened to run into the signage right off the road ... and it's unclear what exactly caused that. In any case, they tell us their staff wasn't involved. It also looks like the guy who originally claimed it was the valet is copping to that not being true too. A Tesla Cybertruck ended up with its front wheel ripped right off after a valet driver at the Beverly Hills Hotel reportedly crashed it ... and Elon Musk himself has something to say. Check out this wild footage that was taken Sunday night -- the all-new futuristic monster truck is lodged into the raised cement curb just under the hotel's iconic green sign, and the damage looks pretty intense. No video that shows the before from all this ... but word on the street is, a valet at the hotel somehow lost control of the vehicle while bringing it around to the owner -- and did this. You can also see that the wheel is pretty torn up ... which is somewhat ironic, to be honest. @elonmusk the beverly hills hotel valet just crashed my friends brand new cybertruck outside pulling it around!! Can you help out in getting another?? pic.twitter.com/aEHIk2iudq Of course, Tesla notably designed the Cybertruck with durability in mind, but we've already seen examples -- including this -- that it might not be the toughest thing on the road. From the sounds of it, it looks like the truck is past the point of salvaging 'cause a friend of the vehicle's owner asked Tesla owner Elon Musk on X for a replacement. The billionaire has yet to respond ... but he did acknowledge another X post referencing the crash, giving a little speculative insight into the reason behind the crash. Cyberbeast is faster than a Porsche 911, but looks like a truck, so perhaps the valet wasn’t expecting so much acceleration EM basically said that the Cybertruck is much faster than a Porsche 911, so its immense power probably caught him off guard ... in other words, he thinks it was too much truck for the valet to handle. FWIW, Tesla does have a Valet Mode that's designed to help prevent accidents like these by limiting the vehicle's peak power and imposing a speed limit of 70 MPH while being driven by valets -- but clearly, it's not foolproof.

Tesla CyberTruck Collision Near Beverly Hilton Hotel,2024-03-05T20:43:01+00:00,https://www.canyon-news.com/tesla-cybertruck-collision-near-beverly-hilton-hotel/180709,"BEVERLY HILLS—It was reported over the weekend that a Tesla Cybertruck suffered some damage after colliding with the curb near The Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday, March 3. The vehicle ran onto the road near the iconic signage for the entrance of the hotel. The vehicle sustained damage to its front-end. There were no reports of any injuries during the incident. It was initially reported that a valet at the hotel was responsible for the collision, but that report was proven to be inaccurate. X user Greggertruck tweeted: “The truth is SO important, and I want to make sure I always share it. I received a message this morning letting me know that the crashed Cybertruck at the Beverly Hills Hotel was NOT driven by the valet.

			Trending:		 A Los Gatos partner for consulting accounting giant PwC allegedly drank alcohol to more than twice the legal limit at a company lunch and in bars with colleagues afterward, then smashed his Tesla at high speed into a young man’s car on a South Bay highway, severely injuring the man, a lawsuit claims. Ousmane Caba drove to San Francisco last June for a “partnership lunch” where he consumed alcohol supplied by the company, formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, according to a lawsuit filed against him and PwC  by John Cooper, the 22-year-old man Caba allegedly rear-ended and left with catastrophic injuries. The lawsuit accuses PwC of having a “long history of mixing company-sponsored events with the overconsumption of alcohol.” Caba and PwC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. After lunch, Caba “hit the bars and nightclubs” and continued drinking with PwC partners as is “customary” following the lunches that celebrate incoming new partners, the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Santa Clara County Superior Court alleged. “After drinking all night,” the lawsuit claimed, “Caba stumbled from the bars in the early morning of June 3, 2023, and attempted to drive home. His blood alcohol was over twice the legal limit, and he was so drunk he was barely conscious.” Related Articles

While driving erratically southbound on Highway 85, Caba sped up behind Cooper, a Santa Clara County resident driving home from work, at about 100 mph, “approaching Mr. Cooper’s car as if it were standing still,” the lawsuit alleged. Caba’s Tesla alerted him to the presence of Cooper’s vehicle, “but due to (Caba’s) level of intoxication and excessive speed, (he) ignored the warning signs and plowed right into the rear of Mr. Cooper’s vehicle,” the lawsuit claimed. “The forceful collision nearly killed Mr. Cooper and resulted in numerous forceful impacts along with catastrophic and lifelong injuries.” According to the lawsuit, Caba earlier this year pleaded no contest to charges related to the crash. Cooper’s lawsuit accuses Caba and PwC of negligence, and seeks unspecified damages along with compensation for medical expenses, lost wages and lost future earnings.

'Apocalypse-proof' Tesla Cybertruck defeated by some sand,2024-03-06T22:27:20+00:00,https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/tesla-cybertruck-gets-stuck-in-sand-18707997.php,,No rating found
OpenAI: Musk's control issues at heart of ongoing rift,2024-03-06T20:34:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3714164/openai-musks-control-issues-at-heart-of-ongoing-rift.html#tk.rss_all," Elon Musk’s intent to take control of OpenAI and merge it with Tesla are at the center of the fight between the controversial Tesla founder and the AI startup he helped get off the ground, but which is now being financed by Microsoft. That’s what OpenAI argued in a blog post Wednesday co-authored by CEO Sam Altman and other key members of the company’s leadership team. The post shares Open AI’s side of the story after Musk filed a lawsuit against Altman and the company — the creator of ChatGPT — on claims of breach of its founding mission. OpenAI will move to dismiss that lawsuit, which alleged the company is no longer working “to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity…,  according to the suit. Instead, Open AI is working “to personally benefit the individual defendants and the largest technology company in the world.” Neither Musk nor OpenAI have revealed whether there is a documented and binding contract stating an agreement to serve that mission. OpenAI maintains the company has not veered off course and aims “to ensure AGI benefits all of humanity, which means both building safe and beneficial AGI and helping create broadly distributed benefits,” according to the post. The ultimate reason for the impasse with Musk came when he wanted the company to become a for-profit entity with him at the helm, OpenAi said. While its founders originally thought OpenAI might be a non-profit, they realized it must be a for-profit to gain access to the billions of dollars needed to reach its AI goals. That’s where Musk began to exhibit control issues. “Elon wanted majority equity, initial board control, and to be CEO,” according to OpenAI. “We couldn’t agree to terms on a for-profit with Elon because we felt it was against the mission for any individual to have absolute control over OpenAI.” Musk then suggested merging OpenAI into Tesla, another idea at which OpenAI’s founders balked. Eventually, Musk left, saying on his way out the door that the company’s probably of success “was zero,” and vowing to build a competitor within Telsa, which he has since done with xAI. Some of the revelations in the post — including emails exchanged between Musk and OpenAI leaders with some content redacted — appear to reflect Musk’s disapproval of the company’s alignment with Microsoft. To him, OpenAI lost its more universally beneficial charter and became “a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company in the world.” OpenAI execs rebutted the claim, asserting there was never a plan for the company to open-source its AI completely and that it remains true to its mission to make AI available for all. “Elon understood the mission did not imply open-sourcing AGI,” OpenAI said. They painted a portrait of Musk as a disappointed leader who walked out when things didn’t go his way and is now rattled OpenAI has found  success with Microsoft’s backing. Musk’s lawsuit aims to disrupt the ties between OpenAI and Microsoft. It seek...",-2

Arson near Tesla's Gigafactory: Who is the Volcano Group?,2024-03-06T20:24:00+00:00,https://www.dw.com/en/arson-near-tesla-s-gigafactory-who-is-the-volcano-group/a-68457754?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf,"An arson attack has shut down operations in Tesla's so-called Gigafactory in Germany. The far-left Volcano Group has claimed responsibility. What do we know about them? On Tuesday morning, around 4:50 a.m., an electricity pylon in the German state of Brandenburg went up in flames. Old tires piled around the mast suggested it was a deliberate case of arson. Seconds later, electricity to surrounding villages was cut off, affecting thousands of households. The cuts also affected Tesla's so-called Gigafactory in the nearby area of Grünheide. The car factory is meant to manufacture 750 e-cars a day, but following the outage, some 12,000 workers were evacuated as production came to a stillstand. Tesla stated it did not expect production to resume this week and estimated the damages to be around ""several hundred million euros."" Shortly after, an organization known as the Volcano Group (Vulkangruppe) claimed responsibility for the fire online. ""We sabotaged Tesla today,"" the far-left environmental group stated in an open letter that also accused Tesla CEO Elon Musk of being a ""techno-fascist."" The letter went on to criticize Tesla's implications in driving predatory capitalism, worker exploitation, environmental degradation and modern surveillance technology, which is why. The stated goal was to ""bring Tesla to its knees."" Not much is known about the so-called Volcano Group, other than that it is considered far-left and anarchical. The letter also indicated anti-patriarchal motives when it called the arson attack a ""present for March 8,"" which is International Women's Day. Authorities have confirmed that the content, style and structure of the letter are similar to several other letters claiming responsibility for attacks in the past years. This might indicate the same people behind the different attacks, suggesting the group has stable structures and long-term members. The Berlin police said the group appears to have been active since 2011, mostly in the states of Berlin and Brandenburg. They added that most attacks targeted communication and data lines, electricity pylons and company vehicles. No people had been injured so far, according to the police report. The same report also indicated the group aimed to expose the vulnerability of urban mobility and communication infrastructure, as well as disrupt public order and cause considerable property damage. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video In 2018, the far-left group destroyed power lines in Berlin's Charlottenburg district in what was likely its largest attack until now. The resulting power outage affected 6,500 homes and left 400 businesses unable to operate for hours. Damages were estimated at around several thousand euros. Tesla's plant in Grünheide has also been targeted before. In 2021, when the factory was still under construction, nearby power cables were set on fire. German politicians have condemned the suspected arson...",-3

"Electric car maker Rivian halts planned $5B Georgia EV plant, launches cheaper Tesla rival",2024-03-07T21:55:42+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/07/business/rivian-halts-planned-ev-plant-launches-cheaper-tesla-rival/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Rivian Automotive said Thursday that it’s halting plans for a yet-to-be-constructed $5 billion plant in Georgia — the same day it launched a budget-conscious electric vehicle designed to rival Elon Musk’s Tesla. Production of its forthcoming R2 model — an electric, midsize SUV that can rev to 60 miles per hour in less than three seconds  — will be diverted to the California-based automaker’s existing facility in Illinois. Rivian said the shift will allow it to start delivering the $45,000 vehicle as early as the first half of 2026. Though Rivian’s latest model has been touted as a cheaper EV offering — “pricing that makes them accessible to a lot of people,” Rivian said in a statement to The Post — it rings in a bit more than a 2024 Tesla Model Y, which the automaker’s website says starts at $36,490. Rivian had previously said only that the R2 would launch sometime in 2026, though didn’t specifying when until Thursday, when it touted that a first- or second-quarter of 2026 delivery date was accelerated from what the company had anticipated. “We’re able to achieve that accelerated timing by leveraging our production capabilities in Normal, using our Illinois site to launch R2 and get that into market as quickly as we can,” CEO RJ Scaringe said. The midwestern plant is where Rivian also makes its  its electric delivery vans. The manufacturing site can reportedly produce as many as 150,000 vehicles a year, a Rivian spokesperson said.  With the addition of R2 — the five-seater version of the automaker’s larger R1 SUV — Rivian said it expected total annual capacity of 215,000 units at the plant. The move was also touted as a way to save the automaker $2.25 billion in capital expenditures, the company said amid a slowdown in demand for EVs — which garnered some bad press earlier this week after an analytics firm exposed how their tire emissions pollute the air, making them not as eco-friendly as consumers originally thought. “This certainly takes some pressure off the continued massive cash investment needed for the Georgia plant,” said Vitaly Golomb, a Rivian investor and an electric and autonomous mobility expert.  “I would also hope that they are being conservative and will be able to pull forward the delivery dates even further.” The company has assured that it has sufficient capital to fund operations through the launch of the R2. Shares of the automaker jumped as much as 16% after the announcement, their biggest gain since July, according to Bloomberg. Rivian’s shares closed at $12.51, marking a 13% gain. But the stock is down more than 45% year to date on concerns over Rivian’s cash and consumer demand for its products. Rivian produced 57,232 vehicles last year and said growth this year would be flat as it tackles a slowdown in the sector, as well as multiple weeks of production downtime to make upgrades intended to cut costs and improve margins. Despite the immense popularity of SUVs...",2
Hugging Face launching robotics project with former Tesla scientist,2024-03-07T21:46:28+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/hugging-face-launching-robotics-project-with-former-tesla-scientist/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular Hugging Face appears to be the latest AI player joining the robotics race, as a former Tesla scientist says he's starting an ""ambitious"" open-source robotics project at the AI tech platform. ""After 3 years @tesla and Optimus, I am thrilled to announce that I joined Hugging Face to start an ambitious open robotics project! (open as in open-source, not as in Open AI) Looking for engineers to build real robots in Paris,"" AI researcher  Remi Cadene announced on X, formerly Twitter. Also: OpenAI partners with startup to create advanced AI models for humanoid robots Previously, Cadene worked on self-driving vehicle technology and humanoid robots at Tesla. Hugging Face is an open-source platform that provides a large repository for AI tools and pre-trained models, though most focus on natural language processing (NLP) tech. The site also works as a place for developers and users to convene and build a community around machine learning and AI, maintaining its open-source collaboration focus. Though Hugging Face hasn't confirmed that it's entering the robotics market, the Hugging Face X account has reposted Cadene's announcement and other posts discussing the new venture. Also, Hugging Face appears to have posted a job listing for an Embodied Robotics Engineer in France. ""In this role, you will be responsible for designing, building, and maintaining open-source and low-cost robotic systems that integrate AI technologies, specifically in deep learning and embodied AI,"" the job posting reads. ""You will collaborate closely with ML engineers, researchers, and product teams to develop innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible in robotics and AI.""

Tesla Cybertruck Embarrasses Itself In Tug Of War With Silverado HD,2024-03-07T20:50:00+00:00,https://jalopnik.com/tesla-cybertruck-embarrasses-itself-in-tug-of-war-with-1851317370," Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted a video of a Cybertruck pulling an F-150 uphill in a game of tug-of-war in 2019, but when real people attempted a similar stunt with a diesel Silverado HD, the stock Cybertruck disabled power.  It turns out, the Cybertruck can’t tug without the CPU shutting the whole thing down, as Inside EVs reports, Unfortunately, the Cybertuck can’t tug. Once the Silverado begins to pull the Cybertruck, some sort of failsafe kicks in and disables the motors/cuts power to the Cybertruck. This was a big letdown, especially since Tesla hyped the Cybertruck tug-of-war abilities during the debut. The Cybertruck does manage to pull the Silverado but only when its in park (with nobody inside the truck for some odd reason too). In the video, you’ll see that they even disconnected the ABS sensors on the Cybertruck, but that still didn’t allow it to tug. Maybe there is a workaround? If so, we think someone will find it soon enough, so stay tuned to see if a tampered-with Cybertruck can tug-of-war. It seems we may have been duped by Tesla and Elon Musk because replicating something like what’s seen in the video below doesn’t appear to be possible with a stock Cybertruck. This is not the first time that Tesla doctored results to make its products look superior; as we covered previously, Tesla also intentionally misled the public when it claimed a Cybertruck would beat a Porsche 911 in a quarter-mile drag race while towing a Porsche 911. This kind of behavior is disappointing to see, but not surprising given the shifty nature of previous Tesla claims and the generally shifty nature of the company’s CEO Elon Musk. This now marks the third time that Tesla and Elon Musk have knowingly bullshitted their respective ways into headlines, with the first time being back in 2016 when Tesla released a fake video showing fake self-driving capabilities. That was confirmed fake in 2023 when a Tesla engineer admitted it was a farce. Then, at the Cybertruck delivery event late last year, Tesla lied about the Cybertruck towing a Porsche 911 beating a 911 in a quarter-mile drag race. That was confirmed fake when “Engineering Explained” crunched some numbers and realized that Musk lied about the race taking place over a full quarter-mile, and likely used a base, manual transmission 911.  Automakers are known to make some bold claims, but bold-faced lies that are meant to mislead the public is just embarrassing. The Cybertruck is already absurd enough as it is, and I don’t think it really needs to work so hard to win over traditional pickup truck buyers. It has enough standout features to make it appeal to buyers without the need for lies. Do I think those buyers should undergo a psychological evaluation? Yes, but money doesn’t buy taste.

Tesla FSD Car Data Infrastructure is Years Ahead,2024-03-07T20:34:43+00:00,https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2024/03/tesla-fsd-car-data-infrastructure-is-years-ahead.html,"Home » Artificial intelligence » Tesla FSD Car Data Infrastructure is Years Ahead Yesterday, AI Expert James Douma predicted that Tesla FSD version 12 would be able to eliminate 99% of the human interventions experienced in FSD version 11. Technology analyst and investors Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner describe what they have learned about how Tesla gathers the data for FSD training.  Tesla tracks all of the best human drivers of Tesla cars.
The AI computer in the filters and determines which unusual situations were handled by the car and driver that day.
The useful training cases are returned to Tesla’s central systems after compression.
The FSD system is measuring the pixels of the video with the good driver behavior. The label is the good driver behavior.

Hopefully this is a rare case where accumulating facts eventually triumph over disinformation, FUD and politics by brute force. When FSD is unambiguously better than most human drivers, regulatory barriers will weaken and collapse. Tesla seems quite prepared to just patiently iteratively improve it until that happens. In retrospect this may be harder and take longer than employing tens of thousands of Optimus robots at Tesla and suppliers – but it will have made that possible. Comments are closed.",3

Cybertruck Drivers Humiliating Themselves Are the Biggest Threat to Tesla's Future,2024-03-08T21:50:00+00:00,https://gizmodo.com/cybertruck-drivers-humiliating-themselves-are-the-bigge-1851320392,"The Cybertruck was such a  misfire for Tesla that Elon Musk, close to tears, told investors “we dug our own grave” in the effort to launch the vehicle. But after years of delays, failed promises, and on-stage gaffes, the truck finally made it onto the streets and into the hands of drivers. For better or worse, the Cybertruck is one of Tesla’s biggest bets, and it’s the product that could make or break the company’s reputation. Unfortunately for Musk, a lot of the truck’s earliest adopters are people with really bad ideas. Many of these de-influencers made their mistakes for the sake of content. Some, like streamer Adin Ross, tested the company’s bolder claims with antics like firing a gun at the vehicle. Others took the Cybertruck places it shouldn’t go, like onto the beach or slamming into iconic road signs in Los Angeles. And then there are the Cybertruck owners who added their own aesthetic touches to Tesla’s already ostentatious design, with winning flourishes like gigantic bullhorns on the truck’s hood, or spraypainted graffiti-style art.  For Musk’s detractors, the litany of Cybertruck fails have been a never-ending source of entertainment. Tesla already had a hard road in its effort to prove this is a vehicle that should be taken seriously, and Cybertruck drivers’ public self-humilations could make that difficult task impossible.  Here are ten of the most embarrassing moments from Cybertruck owner’s first few months. If nothing else, these marred, stranded, and defaced vehicles are artifacts of a truly bizarre moment in car history. 2 / 12 3 / 12 4 / 12 5 / 12 6 / 12 7 / 12  Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted a video of a Cybertruck pulling an F-150 uphill in a game of tug-of-war in 2019, but when real people attempted a similar stunt with a diesel Silverado HD, the stock Cybertruck disabled power.  It turns out, the Cybertruck can’t tug without the CPU shutting the whole thing down, as Inside EVs reports, Unfortunately,  the Cybertuck can’t tug. Once the Silverado begins to pull the  Cybertruck, some sort of failsafe kicks in and disables the motors/cuts  power to the Cybertruck. This was a big letdown, especially since Tesla  hyped the Cybertruck tug-of-war abilities during the debut. The  Cybertruck does manage to pull the Silverado but only when its in park  (with nobody inside the truck for some odd reason too). In  the video, you’ll see that they even disconnected the ABS sensors on  the Cybertruck, but that still didn’t allow it to tug. Maybe there is a  workaround? If so, we think someone will find it soon enough, so stay  tuned to see if a tampered-with Cybertruck can tug-of-war. It  seems we may have been duped by Tesla and Elon Musk because replicating  something like what’s seen in the video below doesn’t appear to be  possible with a stock Cybertruck. 8 / 12 9 / 12 10 / 12 11 / 12 12 / 12",-3

Billionaire drowned in Tesla ‘when she couldn’t break strengthened windows’,2024-03-09T22:46:54+00:00,https://metro.co.uk/2024/03/09/billionaire-drowned-tesla-when-couldnt-break-strengthened-windows-20433423/,"NEWS... BUT NOT AS YOU KNOW IT The sister-in-law of a top US politician drowned in her Tesla after she was unable to break the strengthened glass as she sank into a pond.  Angela Chao, the sister-in-law of Mitch McConnell, died last month after she reversed into a body of water on a private ranch in Texas.  The 50-year-old was driving home in her Model X from an evening with friends when she attempted a three-point turn accidentally put her car into reverse.  But the type of glass used on the windows and the sunroof is nearly impossible to break underwater, according to the American Automobile Association.  As the car started to sink, Angela called a friend in a panic and rescuers tried to save her over the next several hours.  One friend even jumped into the pond to attempt to rescue her before emergency services arrived 24 minutes after they were called.  They found the vehicle completely submerged, with some even being able to stand on the roof of the car.  But dive teams had to be brought in along with a tow truck – which did not have a cable long enough to reach the car.  After the Tesla was pulled from the water, hundreds of gallons rushed out as the doors were opened.  Angela was found unresponsive, with paramedics trying to revive her for 43 minutes.  Drivers need to roll down electric windows within seconds of an accident occurring.  It would also have been impossible to open the car door due to water pressure against the side of the door.

Anglela’s husband Jim Breyer wrote: ‘We are heartbroken.’  Her father, James S.C. Chao remembered his youngest daughter as ‘thoughtful, kind and devoted’ and a ‘charismatic and visionary leader’.  He said: ‘It is with a heavy heart and deep sadness that I announce the passing of my beloved youngest daughter, Angela Chao. ‘Angela is a brilliant woman, a charismatic and visionary leader and much-loved by all her sisters, our entire family and friends. ‘As a daughter, sister, mother, aunt, wife and friend, she was unfailingly filial, thoughtful, kind and devoted.’ The family added: ‘As a trail blazer for women in the executive suite, she inspired others to pursue their dreams.

EV competition in China is so fierce that built-in fridges are passé and Tesla-beating BYD offers drones and gaming-friendly detachable steering wheels,2024-03-10T21:42:20+00:00,https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/10/china-electric-vehicles-competition-spurs-unusual-features-byd/,"In China, electric vehicles with built-in fridges and even in-car karaoke systems are considered passé. Instead, carmakers are turning to increasingly novel add-ons from beds to cooktops to boost sluggish sales. Top EV makers are facing a slowdown in demand at home as consumers curb spending, just as geopolitical tensions with major Western economies cloud the outlook for exports. Meanwhile for smaller players, the ability to think creatively is core to their survival, with the cut-throat industry bracing for a likely wave of consolidation as China looks to rein in the excesses left behind by years of generous subsidies. The high-tech offerings also highlight the risk for Western manufacturers should they fall even further behind in carving out market share in the world’s biggest auto market. China-made vehicles are viewed by local customers as better suited to their extensive technology demands and preference for high levels of connectivity. Read more: Chinese EVs seen as status symbols are being bought new in countries where they aren’t officially sold yet thanks to a loophole “While legacy automakers still only focus on the drivability of a car, Chinese companies are not satisfied with that,” Wang Binggang, an Xpeng Inc. salesperson, said in a showroom in central Shanghai. “We are extending the possibilities to all kinds of living and recreational scenarios, and that’s part of the reason why customers love e-cars these days.” Here’s a look at some of the offbeat offerings now available in China: Just one click on the in-car display in Xpeng’s G9, an SUV with a starting price at 263,900 yuan ($36,700), and it turns into a bed that comfortably sleeps two people. Drivers who install the so-called sleeping kit feature are able to make both front and back seats lay completely flat, then watch as a double-size air mattress unfolds and is automatically inflated. The company is looking to muscle in on China’s increasingly popular camping culture, but the car may also prove a hit with desk jockeys enduring the country’s notoriously grueling office hours and looking for a place to nap. The feature was an unexpected savior for some families during February’s Lunar New Year holiday. Long waits at charging stations, traffic jams that lasted for hours and snowstorms that left tens of thousands of drivers stranded across the country saw many in sudden need of a safe place to sleep. One of the most notable features of an electric vehicle is how much quieter, and smoother to accelerate, it is compared with a combustion-engine car. But the downside is that it can cause or worsen motion sickness. And the way an EV’s brakes work can also add to the feeling of imbalance for some drivers and passengers. Hangzhou-based Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. says it has solved that problem in its Galaxy E8 electric sedan, which vibrates at 1.25 hertz — the same as a human heartbeat — when the car is driving on undulating terrain. The car, which went on sale on Jan. 5 and sta...",-2
Germany: Protest against Tesla plans to expand 'Gigafactory',2024-03-10T17:13:00+00:00,https://www.dw.com/en/germany-protest-against-tesla-plans-to-expand-gigafactory/a-68487715?maca=en-rss-en-top-1022-rdf,"The demonstrations just added to the automaker's headache over plans to expand its assembly plant near Berlin. It had already shut its plant for several days due to apparent sabotage. Hundreds of environmental activists protested Sunday against the expansion of electric carmaker Tesla's factory outside of Berlin. The demonstration in Grünheide, on the outskirts of the German capital, comes only days after a suspected arson attack on the power supply halted production at the Tesla Gigafactory. Tesla's proposal to expand the electric vehicle factory, including constructing a freight station, warehouses, and a company kindergarten, has encountered resistance from people who fear it will contaminate drinking water.   Part of the planned area of expansion is in a water protection area. Local residents who support the expansion and view it as an essential part of the area's future development also staged a smaller counter-demonstration. Meanwhile, the head of Tesla's works council told several hundred workers at the production site on Friday, ""We will restart the factory next week."" An investigation was underway after activists calling themselves the Volcano Group said they sabotaged production on Tuesday. An electricity pylon near the plant caught fire, causing power outages in the factory and nearby towns.

""The legislator is currently working on the requirements for the security of critical infrastructure, including against physical threats. The aim is to further raise the level of security,"" she said. In February, most Grünheide residents voted against the expansion plans in a nonbinding poll. To make room for the site additions, about 100 hectares of forest would have to be cleared. Tesla had announced further talks on the issue. The facility is the only factory run by billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle company in Europe.

Revolutionizing EV Charging: The Tesla Supercharger Adapter,2024-03-10T14:03:58+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/revolutionizing-ev-charging-the-tesla-supercharger-adapter/,"In a groundbreaking development that promises to reshape the landscape of electric vehicle (EV) charging, Tesla has unveiled its latest innovation: an adapter that allows non-Tesla vehicles to charge at Tesla Supercharger stations. This game-changing device aims to address one of the EV industry’s most significant challenges, but does it live up to the hype? The adapter, weighing 1.6 pounds, enables Tesla’s North American Charging Standard plug to fit into non-Tesla CCS ports, providing access to over 15,000 Tesla Supercharger stalls across the US and Canada. The potential impact is immense, with EVs from manufacturers like Ford, GM, and Hyundai, and more are set to join the fray.  However, as our intrepid tester discovered, the road to seamless charging isn’t without its bumps. Wrestling with the adapter proved challenging, with complaints ranging from weight to plastic durability issues. Yet, once connected, the process was surprisingly straightforward, with the adapter seamlessly integrating with the Tesla Supercharger infrastructure. Yet, the adapter’s arrival hasn’t been without its controversies. Parking logistics present a significant hurdle, with non-Tesla vehicles requiring specific configurations to access charging spots. This has led to concerns about charger hogging and inconveniences for other EV drivers. Additionally, compatibility issues have surfaced, with only Tesla’s V3 and newer Superchargers supporting non-Tesla vehicles. Navigating to these supported chargers can be a headache, with Ford’s Charge Assist app facing criticism for its sluggish performance. Despite these challenges, early tests suggest promising results. Charging times at Tesla Superchargers are competitive, albeit with slightly higher rates for non-Tesla vehicles. Yet, Tesla’s network’s breadth and ease of use remain unparalleled, cementing its status as a game-changer in the EV charging landscape. Moreover, concerns about potential backlash from Tesla owners have been largely unfounded, with many embracing the spirit of inclusivity and collaboration in the EV community. While the Tesla Supercharger adapter may not be without its flaws, its arrival heralds a new era of accessibility and convenience in EV charging.

Tesla Withdraws from Auto Industry Group Amid Dispute Over Emissions Standards,2024-03-10T12:49:49+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/tesla-withdraws-from-auto-industry-group-amid-dispute-over-emissions-standards/,"In a dramatic move, Tesla, the trailblazing electric car manufacturer led by Elon Musk, has announced its departure from the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI), citing disagreements over future emissions targets. The FCAI, a longstanding representative of the auto industry in Australia, has been a key player in advocating government policies and setting industry standards. However, Tesla alleges that the FCAI’s stance on emissions reduction does not align with its own mission to promote sustainable transportation. The rift between Tesla and the FCAI came to a head following the government’s proposal of new vehicle efficiency standards, known as cleaner, cheaper-to-run cars. These standards aim to address the growing concern over vehicle emissions and their impact on the environment. Notably, the FCAI expressed disappointment with the aggressive targets and penalties outlined in the proposal, slated to take effect on January 1, 2025.  In response, Tesla penned a letter to FCAI chair Tony Weber, accusing the organization of spreading false information about the proposed standards. Tesla contends that the standards do not impose penalties on individual vehicles but rather set targets for car companies as a whole. According to Tesla, meeting these targets would result in zero penalties and no impact on prices for consumers. However, Tesla raised concerns that the FCAI’s assertions could deter consumers from purchasing electric vehicles (EVs) by suggesting that prices would significantly drop in the near future. Conversely, Tesla argues that if high-emission vehicles face price increases, consumers might flock to purchase them instead, creating a complex market dynamic. The dispute between Tesla and the FCAI underscores broader tensions within the auto industry regarding emissions standards, market competition, and the future of transportation. As the push for sustainability intensifies, automakers face mounting pressure to innovate and adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes. The ramifications of Tesla’s withdrawal from the FCAI could reverberate across the industry, signaling a shift in power dynamics and potentially influencing future policy decisions. With the automotive landscape poised for transformation, the clash between Tesla and the FCAI represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing debate over emissions, pricing, and consumer choice.

The loneliness of the robotic humanoid,2024-03-11T22:45:33+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/the-loneliness-of-the-robotic-humanoid/,"Perhaps a few years from now, the halls of the Georgia World Congress Center will be peppered with humanoid robots the week of Modex. In 2024, however, Digit stands alone at the supply chain show. It’s a testament to Agility’s healthy head start over competitors like Figure, Tesla, 1X and Apptronik. This time last year at Modex (the Chicago version of the conference), Digit had something of an industrial automation coming out party. A line of the bipedal robots were moving totes to a nearby conveyor belt at select times throughout the week. This week in Atlanta, a rotating cast of eight Digits are working each day from show opening to close. This time, however, the blue and silver robots are doing something a bit different. The demos showcase lineside replenishment and tote retrieval with a flow rack designed for automotive manufacturing. Agility tells TechCrunch that it is currently working with automotive customers — though it has yet to release any names. Famously, Ford was among Agility’s first proponents, announcing a partnership way back at CES 2020. Ultimately, plans to put Digit to work making last-mile deliveries fizzled, as the company instead pivoted focus to the nearer-term issue of warehouse staffing. That proved to be a canny move, as labor figures still have yet to return post-COVID. Former Agility CEO Damion Shelton told me last week that last-mile is still on the table, but there’s more than enough to focus on in the warehouse and manufacturing sectors to keep the company occupied. Putting together a C-suite has been an important piece of the company’s growth over the past 12 months. Co-founders Shelton and Jonathan Hurst have shifted roles, from CEO and CTO to president and chief robotics officer, respectively. A week ago today, former Magic Leap CEO Peggy Johnson took the chief executive role over from Shelton. Last year, the company named Fetch founder and CEO Melonee Wise to the CTO role and brought former Apple and Ford executive Aindrea Campbell in as COO. Agility Robotics’ new CEO is ‘focused on the here and now’  The leadership changes point to a company taking commercialization more seriously. They also put Agility in rare air among top robotics companies, with women in five of its nine C-suite roles. Agility is ramping up production volumes, with plans to hit “high double-digit” production of its bipedal robot by end of year. This week at Modex, the company took the wraps off Agility Arc, deployment and fleet management software for Digit. “The automation platform has all of the things you would expect from a fleet management system, in terms of battery, charging management, workflow management and robot tasking,” Wise tells TechCrunch. “But it also has the other aspects that you need for deploying and configuring a system and remotely monitoring and supporting the system. It’s a single pane of glass that allows you to basically do everything related to managing a fleet of Digits.” Johnson, who previously helmed Magic L...",0
Germany: Berlin Tesla factory power restored after sabotage,2024-03-11T20:38:00+00:00,https://www.dw.com/en/germany-berlin-tesla-factory-power-restored-after-sabotage/a-68498012?maca=en-rss-en-top-1022-rdf,"The Tesla Gigafactory outside Berlin was reconnected to the power grid a week after a far-left group sabotaged the plant.

"Tesla Cars Lose Value Three Times Faster Than A Maserati, Study Says",2024-03-11T19:58:00+00:00,https://jalopnik.com/tesla-cars-lose-value-three-times-faster-than-a-maserat-1851325057,"Tesla’s “no haggle” direct-buy pricing model was once heralded as the future of how Americans would buy cars. Several years later, the dealership system is still going strong. Now, according to a recent study, Elon’s insistence on adjusting MSRPs based on market conditions has had detrimental effects on Tesla’s resale value.  Everyone is well aware that the electric vehicle market is facing some challenges. Inventory is building up, and brands struggle to find buyers beyond enthusiastic early adopters. Since the charging infrastructure still has a long way to go to match the convenience of gas stations, many buyers looking to go green are opting for regular hybrids or plug-in models. While traditional automakers have responded by utilizing a lot of discounts and rebates on their electric models, Tesla has slashed the sticker prices to compete. These price drops, combined with lower consumer demand, have had a cascade effect on the used market causing pre-owned electric model values to plummet. According to a recent study by iSeeCars.com, Tesla’s rate of depreciation from an overall brand perspective vastly outpaces all other automakers. “iSeeCars analyzed over 1.8 million 1- to 5-year-old used cars sold in February 2023 and 2024. By comparing the average prices of cars by segment, brand and model, the analysis shows a general softening of used car prices overall, but a dramatic drop in used electric vehicle prices.” According to this data, Tesla models lose value twice as fast as Alfa Romeo and three times as fast as Maserati. This massive depreciation drop is mostly tied to Elon’s decision to constantly cut prices on new models, forcing an ever-widening gap for pre-owned cars. Even though the Tesla brand has the worst depreciation, because it exclusively makes EVs, the Chevy Bolt is the hardest hit as an individual model when looking at electric cars overall.  According to the iSeeCars data, the top seven steepest depreciating cars are all electric vehicles. Naturally, this is good news for consumers since the top four EVs average under $25,000, which means a potential customer could also qualify for up to $4500 in tax credits for used EVs, bringing the net cost down even further.

"Tesla, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and more rated 'poor' in automated driving test ratings",2024-03-12T23:55:28+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/03/12/tesla-bmw-mercedes-rated-automated-driving-test/,"Most electronic systems that take on some driving tasks for humans don’t adequately make sure drivers are paying attention, and they don’t issue strong enough warnings or take other actions to make drivers behave, according to an insurance industry study published Tuesday. Only one of 14 partially automated systems tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety performed well enough to get an overall “acceptable” rating. Two others were rated “marginal,” while the rest were rated “poor.” No system received the top rating of “good.” “Most of them don’t include adequate measures to prevent misuse and keep drivers from losing focus on what’s happening on the road,” said IIHS President David Harkey. The institute, Harkey said, came up with the new ratings to get automakers to follow standards, including how closely they watch drivers and how fast the cars issue warnings if drivers aren’t paying attention. It also says it is trying to fill a “regulatory void” left by inaction on the systems from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Harkey said the agency needs to do more to set standards for the systems, which are not able to drive vehicles themselves. The agency said Tuesday that it welcomes the IIHS research and will review the report. IIHS safety ratings are closely followed by automakers, which often make changes to comply with them. The 14 systems, which include several variations from single automakers, are among the most sophisticated now on the market, Harkey said. Only one of the systems, Teammate in the Lexus LS, earned the adequate rating. General Motors’ Super Cruise in the GMC Sierra and Nissan’s Pro-Pilot Assist with Navi-Link in the Ariya electric vehicle were rated marginal. Other systems from Nissan, Tesla, BMW, Ford, Genesis, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo were rated poor. Harkey said the driving systems initially were combinations of safety features such as automatic emergency braking, lane departure warnings, lane centering and blind-spot detection. But now they give drivers the chance to not pay attention for some period of time, raising safety risks, he said in an interview. “That’s why the focus is on how do we make sure that the driver remains focused on the driving task,” Harkey said. Some automakers, he said, market the systems in a way that drivers could think they are fully autonomous. “The one thing we do not want is for drivers to misinterpret what these things can or cannot do,” he said. The systems, IIHS said, should be able to see if a driver’s head or eyes are not directed on the road, and whether their hands are on the wheel or ready to grab it if necessary. The institute also said if a system doesn’t see a driver’s eyes on the road or hands aren’t ready to steer, there should be audible and visual alerts within 10 seconds. Before 20 seconds, the system should add a third alert or start an emergency procedure to slow down the vehicle, the institute said. Automakers should also make sure safety syst...",-2

Mitch McConnell’s Sister-In-Law Died After Accidentally Reversing Tesla Into Pond: Report,2024-03-12T21:31:52+00:00,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mitch-mcconnell-sister-law-died-213152856.html,"Angela Chao, the CEO of shipping company Foremost Group and sister-in-law of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), died last month after accidentally reversing her Tesla into a pond at a Texas ranch, according to a Friday report in The Wall Street Journal. Chao, 50, was the younger sister of McConnell’s wife, former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao. Though Angela Chao’s Feb. 11 deathwas reported at the time, The Wall Street Journal’s story sheds new light on the fatal incident. Chao had been enjoying an evening with friends and was preparing to drive back to a residence on the ranch shortly before midnight when she accidentally reversed her Tesla Model X SUV, the outlet reported. The vehicle went over an embankment and into a pond after she attempted a three-point turn. Chao then made a panicked call to a friend as her electric car became further submerged into the Austin-area pond. Chao’s friends reportedly tried to rescue her, with at least one jumping into the water. Emergency workers arrived on the scene about 24 minutes after being called, but had to walk to the pond’s location before attempting to rescue Chao “due to the terrain and accessibility of the location,” according to a Blanco County incident report obtained by the Austin American-Statesman. “The two deputies who were in the water standing on the submerged vehicle requested tools to break the window of the vehicle to perform a possible rescue,” the incident report said, adding that “several tools were used to attempt access to the victim.” A dive team was also sought but none was available at the time of the incident, according to the document. Meanwhile, a tow truck arrived to assist, but was unable to reach Chao’s vehicle due to the short length of a cable. A longer cable was later retrieved, and the car was pulled from the pond, The Wall Street Journal reported. Chao was then found unresponsive and pronounced dead at the scene after unsuccessful attempts to resuscitate her, the outlet said. Blanco County fire department and emergency services did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s requests for additional information about the accident. Shortly after her death, the Blanco County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement that Chao “succumbed from being under the water.” Later, in a letter to state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Blanco County official said that an investigation into Chao’s death was ongoing, noting that it was “not a typical accident.” “Although the preliminary investigation indicated that this was an unfortunate accident, the Sheriff’s Office is still investigating this accident as a criminal matter until they have sufficient evidence to rule out criminal activity,” stated the letter, which was obtained by the American-Statesman. McConnell, the Senate’s longest-serving party leader, announced soon after Chao’s death that he would step down from his position. “As some of you may know, this has been a particularly difficult time for my family.

"Tesla, T-Mobile and Netflix are paying top executives more than they pay in taxes as analysis reveals how corporate profits are soaring while IRS contributions remain flat",2024-03-13T19:41:47+00:00,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13192673/tesla-t-mobile-netflix-paying-executives-taxes-irs.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,"By Alice Wright For Dailymail.Com   Published:  19:41, 13 March 2024   |  Updated:  20:23, 13 March 2024      76 View  comments  Top US companies are paying their senior executives significantly more than they pay in corporate taxes, a new report has revealed.  Companies including Tesla, T-Mobile, Netflix, Ford and Match Group paid their top bosses more than their net tax payments between 2018 and 2022, analysis by Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies found.  For the 35 top companies included in the study the collective net federal income tax bill was negative $1.72billion over the five-year stretch, because they received more money back from the government in refunds than they paid. In comparison, over the same period compensation for senior executives at these firms stood at $9.49billion.  The firms looked at included Elon Musk's Tesla, which paid execs $2.5billion over a negative $1million in taxes. While Netflix paid its execs $675million over $236million in taxes.   Compensation for executives included salaries, bonuses, perks, benefits, stock options and stock awards and did not take into account the personal income taxes executives may have paid. Tesla, led by Elon Musk paid out $2.5billion to executives between 2018 and 2022. However, the figure includes a $55billon payout to Elon Musk that was struck down by a Delaware court in January as excessive.  Judge Kathleen McCormick found that the $55billion awarded to Musk five years ago was a result of the CEO strong-arming Tesla directors.  McCormick in her ruling found that the process leading to the board’s approval of his 2018 compensation package was 'deeply flawed' because of how close Musk was to some of its members.  By contrast, the electric car maker was minus-$1million in its federal income tax balance for the same period, primarily because its carried forward large losses from the previous year, the report claimed.  T-Mobile paid its CEO Mike Sievert and other executives $675m in the five year period, but had a tax of minus-$80million, according to the report.  The network company used a 'variety of tactics' to bring down its tax bill, the ATF and IPS reported.  Those included using a tax deduction for costs incurred buying spectrum licenses and writing off a $350million settlement over a cyber-attack which compromised the data of an estimated 76.6million people.  Executives at many companies are earning signficant more than their businesses pay in taxes, according to a report. The top of list was Elon Musk's Tesla where executives earned $2.5billion between 2018 and 2022, but only paid $1million in taxes T-Mobile paid its CEO Mike Sievert and other executives $675m in the five year period, but had a tax of minus-$80million Netflix paid out $652 million to its executives over the five years of the study, but paid net $236 million in taxes.

Tesla's Gear-Shifting Problems Known Long Before Angela Chao's Death,2024-03-14T16:15:00+00:00,https://jalopnik.com/teslas-gear-shifting-problems-known-long-before-angela-1851335415,"Billionaire and sister to former Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, Angela Chao, drowned in her Tesla Model X after accidentally reversing into a pond on a 900-acre Texas ranch last month. She’d reversed her Tesla Model X when she meant to drive forward during a K turn — a common problem with the vehicle among owners. Chao had told friends that she’d mixed up “drive” and “reverse” several times in her car before the fatal accident, and it seems she is not alone, according to Business Insider: Business Insider found 12 complaints related to the Tesla reverse function in a database of automobile consumer complaints kept by the US Department of Transportation. Seven of those complaints were from people who said the way Tesla had designed the gearshift was confusing, resulting in them sometimes putting the car in drive when they meant to put it in reverse or vice versa. The other five complaints were from people who said their cars appeared to switch between drive and reverse without warning. The issue has also found its way to Tesla forums, where one Tesla owner in 2022 wrote that they had accidentally “shifted to reverse instead of drive by mistake” three times in the two years they’d had the car. Another Tesla owner wrote in 2022 that they “just nearly had an accident” because of confusion over how to put the car in reverse. “Within the first month of having my car I did something similar,” another user responded.﻿ BI doesn’t clarify whether Chao was driving a pre-2021 vehicle, or the post-2021 vehicle with the goofy touch screen and complete lack of indicator and PRND stalks — but because the issue revolves around the screen shifting problem, we can assume it was the latter. However, BI found complaints about both modes of gear shifting: Prior to late 2021, drivers of all Teslas shifted into reverse by depressing the brake pedal and flicking a gear stalk to the right of the steering wheel up — a motion that some complainants said was confusing because, for some models and years, the same motion on the gear stalk disengages the car’s autopilot mode when the brake is not depressed. One driver of a Tesla Model Y said they accidentally put the car in reverse in 2022 while waiting at a stoplight, narrowly avoiding a collision. When the light turned green, they “instinctively” flicked the right-hand gear stalk upward to disengage autopilot so they could turn left, they told the DOT. “Unfortunately, this ‘conditioned’ behavior of mine inadvertently put the car in reverse!! I pressed the accelerator and nearly backed into the car behind me,” the complainant wrote to the agency. “I am 99% certain that I did not have my foot on the brake pedal because I rarely use it nowadays,” they wrote, noting that they rely on the car’s autopilot mode to brake for them.﻿ As for the system after 2021, it got even worse. It’s a problem we reported on three years ago when the new needlessly confusing touch-screen shifting first debuted. It seemed like a major change...",-3
Tesla is the worst performing stock in the S&P 500. Analysts say it has further to fall,2024-03-14T16:12:59+00:00,https://krdo.com/news/2024/03/14/tesla-is-the-worst-performing-stock-in-the-sp-500-analysts-say-it-has-further-to-fall/,"By Nicole Goodkind, CNN New York (CNN) — Elon Musk’s Tesla once represented the future of automaking. Now the company’s own future is in question. The once red-hot electric vehicle maker — heralded as part of the so-called Magnificent Seven behemoth tech stocks — is currently the worst performer in the S&P 500 this year, down nearly 32% since January. The story of Tesla’s (TSLA) decline has been well documented. The company has been plagued by safety issues and recalls, slowing growth and has even been forced to slash prices. But a new report by Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan on Wednesday offers a darker picture than previously imagined. Tesla, he wrote, is a “growth company with no growth.” Langan predicts that Tesla’s growth will remain flat this year and then decline in 2025 as competition increases, deliveries disappoint and the beleaguered auto and tech company is forced to cut prices again. UBS also downgraded its forecast for Tesla on Wednesday. Analysts said concerns are mounting as demand for electric vehicles slow and China begins to compete in the market. With the exception of Tesla, all of the Magnificent Seven companies (that also includes Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google, Nvidia and Microsoft) saw double- or triple-digit earnings growth in the final three months of 2023. Tesla reported a 40% decline in profit from the year before. Tesla has been navigating through a perfect storm. The EV environment is getting more crowded right as the company’s fundamentals have come into question. Its share price has dropped about 60% from its 2021 all-time high of $407. But even with the recent drop in price, Tesla’s stock is still very expensive when compared to its actual earnings and profits, said Langan. The company’s former propensity for rapid growth is no longer certain, he said, and shares likely have further  to fall. Wells Fargo has lowered its price target for the stock from $200 to $125, predicting another 25% decrease in value. UBS, meanwhile, has lowered its price target to a more moderate $165 from $225.

TechCrunch Minute: Why little EVs from Rivian and Telo could thaw the EV winter,2024-03-14T16:00:13+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/14/techcrunch-minute-why-little-evs-from-rivian-and-telo-could-thaw-the-ev-winter/,"The great EV boom is fading a bit, but that’s not a concern if you take a long-enough view. Sure, Tesla expects slower growth for its car sales this year, and there are some indications that other companies are trimming their electric car plans, but there’s also reason to be optimistic. If you take a look at some upcoming EVs, you may notice that they don’t look precisely like the current, bestselling gas-powered cars out there. I reckon that that is for the best — when you swap power sources, you can shake up the rest of a vehicle’s design, right? So two cheers for Rivian’s R3 and what Telo is cooking up, because their plans have me hype. ",-1

Herz CEO Steven Sher Steps Down Amidst Electric Vehicle Bet Fallout,2024-03-15T22:13:03+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/herz-ceo-steven-sher-steps-down-amidst-electric-vehicle-bet-fallout/,"In a dramatic turn of events, Herz CEO Steven Sher is set to step down from his position, according to a Bloomberg report. This decision comes after a turbulent period for the company, marked by a significant financial setback stemming from its ambitious foray into electric vehicles. The repercussions of Herz’s ill-fated bet on electric vehicles have been felt across the organization, and the company is now scrambling to mitigate the fallout. Former Chief Operating Officer Gil West is slated to take over as CEO, signaling a strategic shift in leadership as Herz navigates turbulent waters. Once touted as a visionary move, the company’s dalliance with electric vehicles has proven to be a costly misstep. Herz incurred a staggering $245 million charge in the fourth quarter, far exceeding market expectations, as the depreciation of electric cars, particularly Teslas, took a toll on profitability. Lower rental returns and higher repair costs have exacerbated Herz’s financial woes, casting a shadow over Sher’s tenure as CEO.  While Sher’s departure may surprise some, industry analysts point to underlying tensions over Herz’s electric vehicle strategy. Nighthead and Centu, the private equity firms that acquired Herz and oversaw its transformation through bankruptcy, had hoped Sher would execute their vision. However, disagreements over handling the electric vehicle initiative appear to have soured relations, culminating in Sher’s exit from the company. With Gil West poised to take the helm, speculation about Herz’s future direction abounds. Some observers suggest that the company may be reevaluating its commitment to electric vehicles, with a potential pivot towards self-driving cars under West’s leadership. West’s background, including stints at Delta Airlines and GM’s Cruise Robo taxi unit, underscores his expertise in consumer-focused industries, offering insights into Herz’s potential strategic realignment. However, challenges loom large on the horizon for West and Herz alike. The rental car industry is notoriously volatile, with success contingent upon astute vehicle purchasing decisions and market timing. As Herz grapples with the aftermath of its electric vehicle debacle, West must chart a course that steers the company back to profitability and restores investor confidence. The impending leadership transition at Herz underscores the high stakes involved in navigating the rapidly evolving automotive industry. With electric vehicles and self-driving cars poised to reshape the future of transportation, Herz finds itself at a critical juncture where strategic vision and decisive action will determine its fate in an increasingly competitive market.

Elon Musk Takes a Dig at Don Lemon: “Don ‘Veruca Salt’ Lemon”,2024-03-16T20:31:15+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/elon-musk-takes-a-dig-at-don-lemon-don-veruca-salt-lemon/,"Elon Musk, the enigmatic billionaire and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has once again ignited a fiery exchange of words, this time targeting former CNN host Don Lemon. In a scathing tweet posted on Friday, Musk likened Lemon to the spoiled character Veruca Salt from Roald Dahl’s beloved tale Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. “Don ‘Veruca Salt’ 🍋,” Musk quipped, employing a clever emoji to underscore his comparison of Lemon to the outrageously indulged character known for her demanding nature. The jab comes on the heels of a report by The Post detailing Lemon’s purportedly extravagant demands as part of a proposed deal to host a talk show on Musk’s social media platform, X.  According to The NY Post’s report, Lemon’s list of requests included a staggering $5 million upfront payment, an $8 million salary, and an equity stake in the platform. But it didn’t stop there. Lemon also allegedly demanded a free Tesla Cybertruck, a private jet to Las Vegas complete with a luxurious suite for himself and his fiancé, and, perhaps most audaciously, that the company foot the bill for their day of drinking and massages. The clash between Musk and Lemon has been brewing for weeks, ever since Lemon’s much-anticipated move to the X platform was announced in January. However, the deal quickly soured after a contentious interview between them, leaked snippets of which have already sparked intrigue. In one particularly tense moment of the interview, Lemon pressed Musk about the alleged rise of hate speech on the platform, prompting the tech mogul to respond visibly irritated. “I don’t have to answer questions from reporters, Don,” Musk retorted. “The only reason I’m doing this interview is because you’re on the X platform.” While Lemon has promised to release the full interview on March 18, anticipation is mounting as observers eagerly await the uncensored exchange between two of the most formidable personalities in media and tech. As Musk and Lemon’s feud continues to escalate, it’s clear that this clash of titans is far from over. With each jab and counterpunch, the stakes grow higher, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats, eager to see who will emerge victorious in this high-stakes battle of wits and egos. The NY Post article had some delicious comments, too! I like Elon but I question his judgment about hiring Don Lemon. Even billionaires make mistakes. Delusional Don continues to believe what he has to offer has some immensely overblown level of value. While it’s true that the first rule of negotiation is you don’t get what you don’t ask for, it was obvious that when no platform came forward to offer Lemon a gig that immediately defined his true market value.May he slowly disappear into the dustbin of has beens. And the world will be better for this. Love Elon! I wish I had his kind of money and power so I didn’t ever have to take any nonsense. Don IS the Veruca Salt of the DEI reimagined AI Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The name of the factory is perfect...",-1

Norway’s Tesla Revolution: A Blueprint for World Dominance,2024-03-16T19:11:03+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/norways-tesla-revolution-a-blueprint-for-world-dominance/,"In Norway’s crisp, snow-laden landscapes, a silent revolution is unfolding, one that transcends the fjords and peaks that define this Scandinavian nation. Here, amidst the breathtaking beauty of nature’s grandeur, Norway is quietly emerging as the vanguard of a global transition toward electric vehicles (EVs). In a remarkable feat, over 82% of Norway’s new car sales in the previous year were electric vehicles, marking a monumental shift towards sustainable transportation. As CNBC ventured into the heart of this EV utopia, they unearthed a tale of Norway’s prowess in embracing green mobility. They stumbled upon an American automaker’s quiet conquest in this land of innovation: Tesla. For the discerning Norwegian consumer, Tesla represents more than just a car; it epitomizes a paradigm shift in automotive excellence. “We have three different types of electric cars, and Tesla is another level,” remarked one Norwegian EV enthusiast, extolling the virtues of Tesla’s superior comfort and ease of driving.  Indeed, Tesla’s ascendancy in Norway is palpable. Last year, over 23,000 Model Ys were sold, accounting for a staggering 20% of all vehicles sold in the country, cementing its position as the undisputed leader in Norway’s EV market. However, Tesla’s success story in Norway extends beyond mere sales figures; it embodies a symbiotic relationship between innovation and infrastructure. Fueling Tesla’s triumph is Norway’s proactive stance towards EV adoption, characterized by a suite of government incentives ranging from zero registration tax to free access to toll roads. Moreover, Tesla’s investment in charging infrastructure, including the proliferation of supercharging stations, has allayed range anxiety and bolstered consumer confidence in EVs. Yet, Tesla’s triumph is not devoid of challenges. The rise of Chinese automakers and mounting pressure from labor unions pose potential threats to Tesla’s dominance in Norway’s EV market. Moreover, as Norway begins to scale back EV incentives, Tesla confronts the daunting task of retaining its market share amidst a burgeoning landscape of competitors. Nonetheless, Norway remains steadfast in its commitment to pioneering sustainable transportation solutions, buoyed by an unwavering belief in the power of collective action. “We actually want more competition, especially from you guys and all over the world,” remarked one Norwegian EV enthusiast, encapsulating Norway’s unwavering commitment to fostering an ecosystem of innovation and collaboration. As Norway continues to chart the course for the global EV revolution, the world stands poised to glean invaluable insights from its successes and setbacks. In the crucible of Norway’s icy terrain lies a blueprint for sustainable transportation and a beacon of hope for a greener, more equitable future.

"Former Tesla worker settles discrimination case, ending appeals over lowered $3.2 million verdict",2024-03-16T19:05:43+00:00,https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/state/3324878/former-tesla-worker-settles-discrimination-case-ending-appeals-over-lowered-3-2-million-verdict.html,"

 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Tesla and a Black man who worked at the company’s California factory have settled a long-running discrimination case that drew attention to the electric vehicle maker’s treatment of minorities. Owen Diaz, who was awarded nearly $3.2 million by a federal jury last April, reached a “final, binding settlement agreement that fully resolves all claims,” according to a document filed Friday with the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. The document, which gave no details of the agreement, said both parties agree that the matter has been resolved and the case against the company run by Elon Musk can be dismissed. Messages were left Saturday seeking details from Tesla lawyers and from Lawrence Organ, Diaz’s attorney. The April verdict was the second one reached in Diaz’s case seeking to hold Tesla liable for allowing him to be subjected to racial epithets and other abuses during his brief tenure at the Fremont, California, factory run by the pioneering automaker. But the eight-person jury in the latest trial, which lasted five days, arrived at a dramatically lower damages number than the $137 million Diaz won in his first trial in 2021. U.S. District Judge William Orrick reduced that award to $15 million, prompting Diaz and his lawyers to seek a new trial rather than accept the lower amount. In November, Organ filed a notice that Diaz would appeal the $3.2 million verdict, and Tesla filed a notice of cross-appeal. The case, which dates back to 2017, centers on allegations that Tesla didn’t take action to stop a racist culture at the factory located about 40 miles (65 kilometers) southeast of San Francisco. Diaz alleged he was called the “n-word” more than 30 times, shown racist cartoons and told to “go back to Africa” during his roughly nine-month tenure at Tesla that ended in 2016. The same Tesla plant is in the crosshairs of a racial discrimination case brought by California regulators. Tesla has adamantly denied the allegations made in state court and lashed back by accusing regulators of abusing their authority. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a similar complaint in September.  Musk, Tesla’s CEO and largest shareholder, moved the company’s headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, in 2021, partly because of tensions with various California agencies over practices at the Fremont factory.

"956 Tesla Autopilot crashes investigated, 23 dead, 12 charges – now in courts, Apple engineer's death",2024-03-17T17:30:35+00:00,https://www.forex-rateit.com/956-tesla-autopilot-crashes-investigated-23-dead-12-charges-now-in-courts-apple-engineers-death/,"News at Your Fingertips – Where Stories Come to Life This could be an even tougher test of Tesla's claim that driver negligence is the root cause of accidents. American electric car manufacturer Tesla's Legal problems keep coming back because of old habits. A fatal accident involving the Model X SUV forced the company to go to court in March.  In March 2018, a car crashed into a highway concrete structure in California, completely disintegrating and bursting into flames. Subscribe to T&T's free Cars Newsletter!﻿ Driving a car Apple's Engineer Walter Huang Died in an accident.  Tesla's problem was that the car was driving under the control of the Autopilot system that supports the driver during the collision. The company is defending itself by saying Huang, who was driving the car, abused the system.  He was known to have been playing a video game minutes before the crash, Reuters news agency reported. Tesla has won two previous similar lawsuits citing drivers not following the company's instructions regarding the Autopilot system. According to the instructions published on the company's website, the driver must remain alert at all times and, if necessary, control the car when the situation calls for it. However, new and previously unpublished information has been gathered regarding the case.  It also affects the question of the party who filed the claim. Lawyers representing Huang's relatives questioned Tesla's understanding of how well the company's instructions to drivers work in practical traffic situations.  On the other hand how effectively the safety of the drivers is ensured. According to experts' preliminary opinions, this may be the most rigorous test yet of Tesla's claim that driver inattention was the root cause of the crash. This time, a witness who formerly worked for Tesla will be marched into the witness box.  According to his report, before the 2018 crash, the company had not figured out how quickly a driver could shift his attention to the traffic situation when the car threatened to head into an obstacle. According to a witness statement, Tesla did not install the driver-monitoring camera system in its vehicles until 2021, three years after the aforementioned fatal accident.  The system monitors the driver and alerts him if his inattention lapses. A professor familiar with autonomous vehicles Matthew Wansley Questioning Tesla's knowledge of driver behavior could be the deciding factor, it estimates. “It was clear from the beginning that there would be malpractice.  “Tesla's job would have been to make sure that was practically impossible,” he says. Professor of Law Richard Cupp Tesla is expected to plead that Huang intentionally misused the Autopilot system.  But if the arguments advanced by the plaintiffs hold up, Tesla could face many new lawsuits and huge compensation claims. Tesla has already faced a dozen similar charges.  In at least eight cases, they were also based on personal injuries. Federal traffic safety officials h...",-3
Tesla settles discrimination case with ex-employee who alleges Elon Musk’s EV maker allowed him to be subjected to racial epithets ,2024-03-17T16:01:49+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/03/17/tesla-settles-discrimination-case-with-ex-employee/,"Tesla and a Black man who worked at the company’s California factory have settled a long-running discrimination case that drew attention to the electric vehicle maker’s treatment of minorities.

NVIDIA's new Project GROOT: fully humanoid robot to compete against Tesla Optimus AI robot,2024-03-18T23:11:04+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96958/nvidia-new-project-groot-fully-humanoid-robot-to-compete-against-tesla-optimus-ai/index.html,"NVIDIA had plenty to announce during its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) event, with the launch of Project GROOT: a new foundational model that helps in the development of robots for industrial use (and more). The new Project GROOT stands for ""Generalist Robot 00 Technology,"" with NVIDIA CEO and founder Jensen Huang teasing robots powered by Project GROOT during GTC 2024, which have been designed to understand natural language and emulate movements made by humans by watching them. Huang said: ""Building foundation models for general humanoid robots is one of the most exciting problems to solve in AI today. The enabling technologies are coming together for leading roboticists around the world to take giant leaps towards artificial general robotics"". NVIDIA's newly built Jetson Thor computing system has been designed for the humanoid robots within Project GROOT. The new SoC features a GPU based on the newly announced Blackwell GPU architecture. This includes a transformer engine capable of pumping out 800 teraflops of AI performance, which allows it to run multimodal generative AI models like GROOT. The company also showed off new upgrades to its NVIDIA Isaac robotics platform, which will make robotic arms used around the world not just smarter but also increase flexibility and run more efficiently than ever before.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveils game-changing AI chip as firm looks to solidify dominance,2024-03-18T22:59:07+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/18/business/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-unveils-game-changing-ai-chip-as-firm-looks-to-solidify-dominance/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Artificial-intelligence semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia on Monday unveiled a flagship AI chip, the Blackwell B200, saying it is up to 30 times speedier than its previous chip. Chief Executive Jensen Huang, kicking off the company’s annual developer conference, also launched a new set of software tools designed to help developers sell their artificial-intelligence models more easily to any company that uses Nvidia. Nvidia’s chip and software announcements at GTC 2024 will help determine whether the company can maintain its leadership position as the dominant seller of AI equipment. Nvidia had a roughly 80% share of the data center AI chip market last year. “I hope you realize this is not a concert,” Huang, wearing his trademark black leather jacket, said after taking the stage, in a nod to the rising profile of his company. The B200 takes two chips the size of Nvidia’s previous offering and binds them together into a single chip. The new chip has 208 billion transistors, more than double the 80 billion on the company’s previous chip. All of those transistors can access the memory attached to the chip at nearly the same time, improving productivity. Tom Plumb, CEO and portfolio manager at Plumb Funds, which has Nvidia as one of its largest holdings, said the Blackwell chip was not a surprise. “But it reinforces that this company is still at the cutting edge and the leader in all graphics processing. That doesn’t mean the market is not going to be big enough for AMD and others to come in. But it shows that their lead is pretty insurmountable,” said Plumb. Insider Intelligence analyst Jacob Bourne said Nvidia could solidify its AI dominance. “However, rivals like AMD, Intel, startups, and even Big Tech’s own chip aspirations threaten to chip away at Nvidia’s market share, particularly among cost-conscious enterprise customers,” he said. Nvidia said major customers, including Amazon, Alphabet’s Google, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle and Tesla, are expected to use the new chip. Nvidia also is shifting from selling single chips to selling total systems. Its latest iteration houses 72 of its AI chips, 36 central processors and contains 600,000 parts and weighs 3,000 pounds. Though Nvidia is widely regarded as a chip designer, the company has built a significant battery of software products as well. The new software tools, called microservices, improve system efficiency across a wide variety of uses, making it easier for a business to incorporate an AI model into its work, just as a good computer operating system can help apps work well. Nvidia’s shares have surged 240% over the past 12 months, making Nvidia the US stock market’s third-most valuable company, behind only Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia stock dipped 1% in extended trade on Monday, while Super Micro Computer, which makes AI-optimized servers with Nvidia’s chips, fell 4%. Advanced Micro Devices stock dipped nearly 3% during ...",0
Electric Vehicle Mandates Increase Safety Risks,2024-03-18T22:03:30+00:00,https://chadronradio.com/electric-vehicle-mandates-increase-safety-risks/,"  By U.S. Senator Deb FischerOn April 17, 2021, firefighters raced to extinguish a blaze in a suburb of Houston, Texas. A Tesla Model S crashed, killing two people, and burst into flames.The Woodlands Township Fire Department extinguished the fire. But shortly after, flames erupted again. They put it out a second time — only for the car to reignite once more. The fire chief compared the Tesla to “a trick birthday candle.” Once you blow it out, you never know when it will flare back up.After seven hours, the team of eight firefighters finally put out the fire for good. When a gas-powered car catches on fire, first responders can put it out with 300 gallons of water. It took this team 28,000 gallons before the Tesla’s fire was safely extinguished. They told NBC News that’s the same amount of water their department normally uses in a month. And it’s about the same amount of water that an average American home uses over two years.This story illustrates just one of many public safety concerns with electric vehicles — concerns that our existing infrastructure and first responders aren’t equipped to handle.I recently questioned National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chair Jennifer Homendy about the risks of EVs at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing. Last year, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln conducted a first-of-its-kind crash test of an electric pickup truck to study whether current highway guardrails adequately protect against the growing number of EVs on our roads. EVs are, on average, 30 percent heavier than their gas-powered counterparts. In the UNL crash test, the 7,000 lb electric pickup tore through a highway barrier at 60 miles per hour. The guardrail didn’t even slow the truck down.I asked Chair Homendy about the NTSB’s investigations into electric vehicle safety, including for first responders. She discussed a report on the risks of lithium-ion battery fires, like the one in the Houston suburbs, for emergency responders. Homendy called EVs a “significant risk in terms of battery fire.” “Stranded energy” in a vehicle can cause electric shock to first responders. Also, damaged battery cells can experience uncontrolled increases in temperature and pressure, causing battery reignition.The NTSB concluded that electric vehicle fires pose a threat to first responders and that vehicle manufacturers have distributed inadequate guidance to responders to mitigate safety risks. More research and clearer guidance are necessary to protect our first responders who are increasingly encountering these emergencies. These risks affect everything from our training to our infrastructure — the sprinkler systems installed in buildings now won’t be enough to quench an EV fire.These initiatives will take time. If the Biden administration continues pushing an electrified vehicle fleet as quickly as it is now, safety issues will go unresolved until it’s too late. If the market determines the popularity of EVs rather than the federal government, we’ll have time...",-2

Microsoft hires ex-DeepMind co-founder to lead Copilot AI initiatives,2024-03-19T21:25:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3714780/microsoft-hires-ex-deepmind-co-founder-to-lead-copilot-ai-initiatives.html#tk.rss_all," Microsoft on Tuesday announced the hiring of Mustafa Suleyman, a former co-founder of DeepMind, the AI startup acquired by Google in 2014. Suleyman will assume the role of executive vice president and CEO of Microsoft AI, directly reporting to CEO Satya Nadella. During Suleyman’s time at Google, DeepMind established itself as a frontrunner in AI research; it also caught the eye of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who moved to counteract Google’s growth by founding the nonprofit AI lab, OpenAI. “Microsoft has been strongly signaling that they consider AI to be a core strategy,” said Casey Ellis, founder and Chief Strategy Officer at Bugcrowd, a San Francisco, Calif.-based cybersecurity company. “The appointment of Suleyman doubles down on this.” Suleyman departed from Google parent company Alphabet in 2022 to co-found and lead Inflection AI. Along with Suleyman, Karén Simonyan, Inflection’s co-founder and chief scientist, will join Microsoft as the chief scientist for Microsoft AI, accompanied by several other Inflection employees, according to a memo by Nadella. The newly formed Microsoft AI group will focus on developing the Copilot chatbot, which is integrated into various Microsoft products, including Bing and Windows. The group will also oversee consumer AI products and research. Mikhail Parakhin, CEO of advertising and web services and head of the team responsible for Copilot, Bing, and Edge development, will join the new organization under Suleyman. Misha Bilenko, corporate vice president of Microsoft generative AI, will also be part of the group. “I’ve known Mustafa for several years and have greatly admired him as a founder of both DeepMind and Inflection, and as a visionary, product maker, and builder of pioneering teams that go after bold missions,” Nadella wrote. Inflection said it would continue with a new CEO, Sean White, who was the former chief of research and development at Mozilla, and said it is bringing its Inflection-2.5 AI model to Microsoft Azure and other cloud platforms. An exact date has not yet been announced. “We are hugely proud of what we’ve achieved with Pi,” Inflection said in a blog post. “There will be no immediate changes to the service and we’re committed to ensuring that users get ongoing access to great AI experiences in the future.” Suleyman’s move to Microsoft is part of a larger trend of high-profile shifts in the AI industry. SAP recently appointed Walter Sun, who’d been with Microsoft for 18 years (last serving as vice president of AI), as its new global head of artificial intelligence. At Microsoft, Sun developed Bing Predicts and was involved in creating Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights, which helps businesses understand market trends and brand sentiment. He also played a role in introducing Dynamics 365 Copilot, utilizing OpenAI’s GPT-4 to aid in marketing efforts. Sun’s work includes evaluating AI models for Dynamics 365 and researching effective AI prompts. Microsoft’s push into AI has been clear since annou...",0
Rivian R2 vs Tesla Model Y: Can the R2 challenge the Model Y’s dominance?,2024-03-19T19:00:22+00:00,https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/tesla-model-y-vs-rivian-r2-range-charging-price-release-date/,"Rivian has finally unveiled the new Rivian R2 SUV, it’s long-awaited, more affordable take on an electric SUV. The vehicle isn’t quite as big, or as impressive, as the R1S — but it does represent a compelling option for those who want a large utility EV without paying more than $70,000. But, of course, the vehicle goes up against some seriously tough competition. The Tesla Model Y, for example, may not be an SUV, but it is a crossover-size car, and it is not only the bestselling EV, but it was the bestselling car in the world in 2023. How do the Rivian R2 and the Tesla Model Y compare? Here’s a look at the two, head-to-head. The overall designs of the Tesla Model Y and the Rivian R2 are radically different, and it all starts with the size of the cars. The Tesla Model Y isn’t quite an SUV — despite what some branding might have you believe. It’s more of a crossover, with a hatchback trunk and a tall roofline. It has slanted headlights at the front, flush door handles, and a minimalistic, sleek overall look. Some might feel that the Tesla Model Y’s design is getting a little tired, and perhaps it is, however it’s hard to argue against the car being stylish overall. The Rivian R2 is also pretty stylish—and unlike the Model Y, it is an SUV. It has a blockier, boxier design, ensuring that it has a little more space on the interior. The Model Y looks like a Tesla and the R2 looks like a Rivian. It offers the same oval headlights on the front as the R1S and R1T, with a long light bar that extends across the rear. It’s also a good-looking vehicle and a little more rugged-looking than the Model Y. We’re not going to argue that the Model Y or R2 is better-looking than the other. The fact is that the designs are quite different, so you’ll have to decide for yourself which you prefer. The interiors of the cars are pretty different, too. The Model Y is built to offer a minimalistic and stripped-back look and feel, and it achieves that. The car has a stark interior, with a relatively large infotainment display at the front. In its base form, the Model Y has two rows of seats with and option for a third row of seats. The Rivian R2 has more space on the inside, but you can’t add a third row of seats. Rivian does allow drivers to take advantage of that space in other ways. For example, you can fold down both the second and first row of seats, meaning there’s enough room for an air mattress, making it perfect for camping. The interior of the R2 is also a little more rugged than that of the Model Y, and it also offers a large infotainment display at the front. Neither the R2 nor the Model Y support tech like CarPlay or Android Auto, but they both have decently designed software and infotainment systems. They also both offer some self-driving features. By default, the Tesla Model Y has Tesla Autopilot, which includes adaptive cruise control and lane-centering. Like other Tesla cars, drivers can pay to upgrade to Enhanced Autopilot, or the poorly titled “Full Self-Dr...",-2

                                                 Angela Chao, Mitch McConnell’s sister-in-law, was drunk when she drove into pond, police say                                                  Angela Chao, a shipping industry CEO and sister-in-law to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, was intoxicated when she drove into a pond and died last month in Texas, according to a law enforcement report released Wednesday.  The investigation by the Blanco County Sheriff’s Office concluded that Chao’s death was an “unfortunate accident” and her blood alcohol level was nearly three times the state’s legal limit.  Chao, 50, died the night of Feb. 10 after having dinner with a large group at a ranch near Johnson City, west of Austin. The report describes a frantic scene as friends and deputies tried to pull Chao from her Tesla after she backed it into the pond near a guest lodge on the property.  A friend, Amber Keinan, told detectives that Chao called her at 11:42 p.m. and said the car was in the water and she was trapped inside. The conversation lasted 8 minutes as the car slowly sank.  “Chao told Keinan the water was rising and she was going to die and said ‘I love you,’” the report says. “Chao then said her good byes to Keinan.” Friends swam to the car while another paddled out with a kayak, according to the report. Someone else called 911 at 11:55 p.m. and remained on the phone for 11 minutes.  When law enforcement officials and firefighters arrived, they went into the water and attempted to enter the Tesla, the report said. They broke the window on the driver’s side, and a deputy felt around until he located Chao’s hand.  Emergency crews pulled her out of the car and brought her to shore, where she was pronounced dead at 1:40 a.m. Feb. 11.  A toxicology test determined that Chao had a blood alcohol concentration level of 0.233 grams per 100 milliliters, above the legal limit in Texas of .08, the report says.  Chao was the chair and CEO of her family’s shipping business, the Foremost Group, and the president of her father’s philanthropic organization, the Foremost Foundation. She lived in Austin, which is about 50 miles (80 kilometers) east of Blanco County.  Chao was the youngest of six sisters to immigrant parents who moved to the U.S. from China in the late 1950s. Her eldest sibling, Elaine Chao, is married to McConnell and served as transportation secretary under President Donald Trump and labor secretary under President George W. Bush.  “Angela’s name in Chinese sounds like the characters for peace and prosperity,” her father, James S.C.

Musk said a post on X in January that while a Dojo supercomputer cost $500 million to build, Tesla will spend more than that on Nvidia hardware in 2024. The table stakes for being competitive in AI are at least several billion dollars per year at this point. Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, former Tesla board member and investor in X, said in December that xAI had secured Nvidia GPUs through Oracle to create the first version of Grok. XAI needed more than Oracle could provide. This week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, launched the new Nvidia B200 chip. Tesla is listed as one of six major clients for the new chip.

Mexican Artist Crushes Tesla Model 3 Under 9-Ton Statue,2024-03-21T18:14:00+00:00,https://jalopnik.com/mexican-artist-crushes-tesla-model-3-under-9-ton-statue-1851356246,"Mexican sculptor Chavis Mármol dropped a nine-ton replica of an ancient Indigenous Olmec head onto the roof of a Tesla Model 3 in Mexico City as a brilliant commentary on modern society’s obsession with materialism, excess, and capitalism. This is Mármol’s latest art installation in a series where he uses the symbol of the Indigenous Olmec head as a representation of the cultural roots of the land, and of his, as well as all, Indigenous ancestors — ancestors whose way of life was and continues to be cast aside to make room for flashy, pick yourself up by your bootstraps, work hard and you’ll make something of yourself, capitalism. This art installation is a powerful commentary on our society’s infatuation with hoarding inconceivable riches the way Tesla CEO Elon Musk does. You don’t become one of the richest men in the world with a net worth in the multi-billions without hoarding plenty of stuff. Mármol eloquently explained the significance of his sculpture in an interview, which translated roughly to, The Olmec head imposes itself before the technological object, bursts it, crushes it, and in the end this glorified object with all that technology is just that; it is just a product of a capitalist system when in reality what really matters is where we come from, what we are, and what we have been, generation after generation. I get it; this concept may sound a bit “woo woo” to many, but as our greedy and wasteful way of life has landed us with increasingly severe and life threatening weather systems across the globe, islands of trash floating around our oceans, and microplastics flowing through our bloodstreams, it feels appropriate. Our materialistic and wasteful ways haven’t really served our species particularly well.  Elon Musk is the physical embodiment of this toxic excess. His ideas claim to revolutionize humanity, even going so far as planting microchips in human brains, and yet we as a species are facing more horrifying realities day after day. Food prices are skyrocketing. Housing has become insecure as the cost of homes skyrocket and rental prices soar. The wages that most folks make are unlivable. Our current path as a species feels unsustainable, and honestly disrespectful to the planet that has supported us and our ancestors for hundreds of thousands of years. This art installation is a poignant reminder that we are still just little flesh sacks on a rock flying through space, no matter how far we think we have come as a society. An object that many people dream about one day owning can be rendered valueless in an instant. This powerful sculpture reminds us that human life and human desire is transient. What society should really value instead of money and possessions is happiness, joy, and making the most out of the short time that each of us has on this planet. Thank you for making us think, Chavis Mármol. Advertisement",-2
Biden administration urges US Supreme Court to reject Musk appeal in SEC dispute,2024-03-22T21:42:51+00:00,https://ca.news.yahoo.com/biden-administration-urges-us-supreme-214251307.html,"By John Kruzel WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration on Friday urged the U.S. Supreme Court to turn away billionaire businessman Elon Musk's dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk in December asked the justices to take up his appeal after a lower court upheld his consent decree with the SEC that arose after he posted on Twitter, now called X, in 2018 that he had ""funding secured"" to take his electric car company Tesla private. The SEC accused Musk of defrauding investors. Musk's agreement was part of a settlement with the SEC under which he and Tesla each paid $20 million fines, Musk gave up his role as Tesla's chairman and he agreed to let a Tesla lawyer approve some posts on Twitter. Musk bought the social media platform in 2022 and renamed it. Musk has called the consent decree a ""muzzle"" on his constitutional free speech rights. The Justice Department in its filing said that ""the settlement term here was reasonably designed to minimize the likelihood that petitioner (Musk) would make future false or misleading statements in violation of the securities laws."" A three-judge panel of the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit of Appeals rejected Musk's claim that the SEC exploited the decree to conduct harassing investigations into his use of Twitter. In its ruling, the 2nd Circuit decided Musk could not revisit the screening of Twitter posts on grounds that he had ""changed his mind."" The 2nd Circuit in July 2023 denied Musk's request to rehear the case. Musk's lawyers have said the SEC had no right to impose, as a condition of settling, a ""gag rule"" that they contend violated the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment constraints on governmental limits on free speech. In his December court filing, Musk's lawyers told the justices that authorizing the SEC to require that Musk gain pre-approval for certain social media posts had handed the agency ""intolerable power."" In a separate legal action related to Musk, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has agreed to reconsider its March decision that Musk violated federal labor law by posting on Twitter in May 2018 that Tesla employees would lose stock options if they joined a union. The 5th Circuit heard arguments in the case in January. (Reporting by John Kruzel in Washington; Additional reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; Editing by Will Dunham) FRANKFORT, Ky.

Elon Musk’s $250 billion Tesla losing streak takes another lurch downward on reports of a production cut at his China plant,2024-03-22T20:11:53+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/03/22/elon-musk-tesla-250-billion-market-cap-plummet-shanghai-plant-production-cutbacks/,"Tesla’s no good, very bad year got even worse on Friday following reports that Elon Musk’s EV powerhouse was cutting back production at its China plant. Tesla trimmed the output at its plant in Shanghai (which produces for both domestic and international markets) starting earlier this month and has asked employees to work fewer days, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The company’s stock is already down more than 31% since the start of the year and fell as much as 4% in intraday trading on the China reporting, before rebounding slightly. Shares were down just under 2% as of Friday afternoon. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up about 10%. Several setbacks over the past few months have taken a nearly $250 billion bite out of the company’s market cap.  Late last year, Warren Buffett-backed BYD toppled Tesla as the world’s leading electric carmaker by sales. The Chinese EV company delivered 526,409 vehicles in the fourth quarter, about 8% more than the 484,507 delivered by Tesla.  Chinese carmakers are increasingly making their mark on the EV market, and the car market in general, with low cost vehicles that have left even legacy carmakers like Honda and Nissan scrambling. Musk has himself lauded China’s carmakers, saying they are “the most competitive car companies in the world.”  In part to compete with Chinese automakers, Tesla has cut prices several times over the past year. In part due to Tesla’s price cuts, Hertz CEO Stephen Scherr told Bloomberg in January that the company planned to sell off 20,000 electric vehicles, the majority of which are Tesla’s.  Tesla’s fourth quarter earnings saw its revenue fall short of analyst expectations and its income from operations fall 47% from a year prior. The company also cautioned investors that “volume growth will be lower” in the coming year as it focuses on a “next generation,” vehicle that will be aimed at budget-strapped consumers. Amid the lackluster results, some experts have suggested that it may be time for the Tesla board to force Musk out of the C-suite. Musk, although a visionary entrepreneur, has rubbed some the wrong way at Tesla for his blunt demeanor and reportedly demanding nature toward workers.  In January, Musk demanded 25% voting control of Tesla before he continued with the company’s development of robotics and AI. The ultimatum was salient given that Tesla’s monstrous valuation is at least partly based on hopes that Musk would eventually move the company beyond cars to make it into a technology juggernaut. That promise hasn’t quite panned out yet, and still Tesla has one of the highest forward price-to-earnings multiples of the Magnificent Seven stocks. Pressure on the company is mounting—one top analyst last week sharply described Tesla as a “growth company with no growth.” Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.  © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

"No One Wants To Pay $200,000 For A Tesla Cybertruck Anymore",2024-03-22T19:52:21+00:00,https://jalopnik.com/no-one-wants-to-pay-200-000-for-a-tesla-cybertruck-any-1851359741,"Even before deliveries of the Tesla Cybertruck began, the electric automaker made it clear that it would be a long time before it was produced in anything other than extremely limited quantities. That meant that if you were one of the few who had pulled yourself up by your bootstraps hard enough, you stood to make quite a bit of money auctioning yours off to the highest bidder. The latest failed attempt to do so, this time on Cars & Bids, has us worried, though. Bidding on the 2024 Tesla Cybertruck Foundation Series definitely started off strong. By the end of the first day, it had already crossed the $100,000 threshold, and if bidding had continued at that rate for the rest of the week, we would have been looking at a final sale price of more than $700,000, netting the seller a significant, well-deserved profit.  Unfortunately for the flipper, bidding on their 70-mile Cybertruck quickly slowed down, with day two only seeing the highest bid rise to $133,000. Day three saw the price rise to $150,000, almost assuring a final selling price north of $200,000. And yet, for some reason, those big bids never appeared, and the auction ended at $158,000, presumably well short of what we can only assume was a very fair reserve price.  With an original price of $101,985 after destination, that $158,000 bid would have meant a mere $56,000 profit for the seller, so we’re not surprised they “weren’t quite able to close the gap.” After all, taking less than twice what you paid for a truck you barely even drove would simply be insulting. It’s a Tesla Cybertruck Foundation Series, not a Ford F-150 Lightning. Maybe it’s time to accept that people just don’t want to pay $200,000 for a Tesla Cybertruck anymore. Advertisement",-2

Self-Driving Cars Explained: Are We There Yet?,2024-03-23T23:15:39+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1543291/autonomous-self-driving-cars-explained/,"
The self-driving vehicle concept isn't new and is likely much older than you'd ever imagined. Almost 400 years before the first gasoline-powered automobile was crafted, Leonardo da Vinci had devised a self-propelled cart. This da Vinci invention, developed in the 16th century, utilized gears, springs, and steering capabilities. Technology has moved leaps and bounds ahead in terms of self-driving capability, but has it been fully realized, or is it still firmly in the realm of science fiction?





In order to answer the question, it's important to know there are criteria that separate autonomous driving from level 0 to level 5. Starting with 0, which has virtually no autonomy, a car must offer increasingly more complex sensing and self-thinking capability with each subsequent level until human intervention is absent with level 5. 
So, what level of self-driving cars can the average driver experience today? If you guessed a level 5, you'd be wrong. So far, not taking into account prototypes and only considering actual vehicles the public can use, self-driving has only reached level 2 unless you happen to reside in Phoenix, San Francisco, or Los Angeles.

Tesla Faces Cybersecurity Concerns as Hackers Exploit Software Vulnerabilities,2024-03-23T19:13:08+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/tesla-faces-cybersecurity-concerns-as-hackers-exploit-software-vulnerabilities/,"In an era dominated by digital innovation, Tesla, a trailblazer in the electric vehicle market, finds itself at the forefront of automotive advancement and cybersecurity. Recent events have again thrust the company into the spotlight, this time due to a significant breach in its software systems, raising concerns about the vulnerability of modern vehicles to cyber-attacks. The incident, in which hackers exploited a critical vulnerability in Tesla’s software architecture, highlights the pervasive nature of cyber threats in an increasingly interconnected world. While specific details regarding the breach remain undisclosed, the impact reverberates across the automotive industry, underscoring the urgent need for heightened cybersecurity measures to protect manufacturers and consumers. Tesla’s journey in cybersecurity has been marked by innovation and adversity. As a company built on cutting-edge technology and forward-thinking principles, Tesla has long recognized the importance of safeguarding its systems against malicious actors. Yet, despite its best efforts, the evolving nature of cyber threats presents an ongoing challenge that requires constant vigilance and adaptation.  One of the cornerstones of Tesla’s cybersecurity strategy is its proactive engagement with the hacker community. Through initiatives like bug bounty programs and participation in hacking competitions such as Pwn2Own, Tesla invites ethical hackers to test the integrity of its systems and identify potential vulnerabilities. This collaborative approach helps Tesla identify and address security flaws and fosters a culture of transparency and accountability within the company. However, the recent breach is a stark reminder of the ever-present threat determined adversaries pose. As vehicles increasingly rely on software-driven functionalities, cybercriminals’ attack surface expands, necessitating robust defense mechanisms to mitigate the risk of exploitation. The ramifications of cybersecurity breaches in the automotive industry extend far beyond financial losses. A successful attack could compromise critical systems within Tesla vehicles, potentially endangering the safety of drivers and passengers alike. From unauthorized access to vehicle controls to the theft of sensitive user data, the consequences of a cyber breach are manifold and far-reaching. In response to the heightened threat landscape, Tesla has reaffirmed its commitment to enhancing its cybersecurity infrastructure and fortifying its defenses against future attacks. The company continues investing in cutting-edge technologies and employs a multi-layered approach to security, encompassing preventive measures and rapid incident response capabilities. Moreover, Tesla recognizes the importance of regulatory compliance and industry collaboration in effectively addressing cybersecurity challenges. By adhering to established standards and engaging with stakeholders across the automotive ecosystem, Tesla aims to raise the indu...",-2
Cybertruck Auction Fail Suggests Tesla's Truck Isn't As Appealing As Elon Musk Thinks,2024-03-23T14:48:44+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1546577/tesla-cybertruck-auction-reserve-fail-elon-musk/,"
Did everyone — including Tesla — overestimate the demand for the Tesla Cybertruck in the second-hand market? That largely appears to be the case after a much-publicized auction for Musk's odd-looking electric truck failed to meet the reserve price. The much-discussed auction — hosted on automotive journalist Doug DeMuro's Cars&Bids platform — fizzled out without seeing much action.





While the auction page received thousands of views, over 500 comments, and even made tech headlines, the listing only received 19 actual bids. Of those, only a handful were made with serious intent. Interestingly, these serious bids were placed in the last week of the auction. Hours before the auction was to end, two bidders attempted to get the price to around $160,000.
The highest bid received by this Cybertruck was $158,000. This is still a substantial premium over the vehicle's MSRP for the 600 horsepower, dual motor, Limited Edition Model in question. However, the owner had set a higher reserve price (the lowest price they're willing to sell), which clearly is well above the $158,000 mark.





While the auction fizzling out under $160,000 did surprise many, this seems to be yet another indication of the fact that the demand for resale Tesla Cybertrucks isn't as high as once thought.

As of March 22, 2024, there have been five known instances of someone flipping the Tesla Cybertruck. A common theme with all five instances was that the winning bid amount fell with each subsequent auction.

"2025 Audi Q6 E-Tron, 2025 Infiniti QX80: This Week's Top Photos",2024-03-23T13:15:09+00:00,https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1138023_2025-audi-q6-e-tron-2025-infiniti-qx80-this-week-s-top-photos,"Audi took the covers off its long-awaited Q6 E-Tron this week. The electric compact crossover is a smidgen longer than the Tesla Model Y, and will start sales in the U.S. late this year both in regular and sporty SQ6 guises.   BMW Vision Neue Klasse X concept BMW revealed the Vision Neue Klasse X, a concept that previews the automaker's rival to the Q6 E-Tron. It enters production in 2025 and will likely be badged as the iX3.  2025 Ferrari 812 Superfast successor spy shots - Photo credit: Baldauf Ferrari engineers were out evaluating a prototype for the successor to the 812 Superfast. The new super GT is expected to debut this year with stunning looks, a new platform, a new V-12 engine, and possibly some form of electrification.  2026 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT 63 S Coupe spy shots - Photo credit: Baldauf Mercedes-Benz AMG was testing a new version of its GT Coupe, which is thought to sit somewhere between the current GT 63 grade and the upcoming GT 63 S E Performance plug-in hybrid. An entry-level GT 43 grade also joined the range this week.  2024 Ford Ranger Raptor One of the vehicles we tested this week was the 2024 Ford Ranger Raptor. The baby Raptor sports the same powertrain (albeit with a slightly different power output) as the Bronco Raptor, plus 33-inch BFGoodrich K03 All-Terrain tires, and 10.7 inches of ground clearance.  2024 Ram 2500 HD Rebel We also tested the new Rebel version of Ram's 2500 Heavy Duty. It sports all of the usual upgrades, including underbody protection, a raised suspension, and off-road tires, and combines this with the choice of gas and diesel mills.  2025 Infiniti QX80 And finally, Infiniti showed off a redesigned QX80. The big SUV follows a familiar formula but skips the V-8 this time around in favor of a twin-turbocharged V-6. The interior also appears to have taken a major step up in quality and refinement.

"Vesić: Krivične prijave protiv odgovornih za ""divlji"" parking kod aerodroma",2024-03-24T13:00:41+00:00,https://biznis.telegraf.rs/info-biz/3860338-vesic-krivicne-prijave-protiv-odgovornih-za-divlji-parking-kod-aerodroma,"Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. Vreme čitanja: oko 2 min. Pristupna saobraćajnica kada se skrene sa auto-puta Beograd-Šid prema aerodromu ""Nikola Tesla"" od sledeće subote postaće državni put, najavio je ministar građevinarstva, saobraćaja i infrastrukture Goran Vesić uz poruku da će protiv onih koji su tu probili zaštitnu ogradu i izgradili ""divlje"" parkiralište biti podnete krivične prijave. - To je ugrožavanje bezbednosti saobraćaja, uništavanje državne imovine i krivično delo - rekao je Vesić gostujući na televiziji Pink i dodao da je resorno ministarstvo čekalo oko mesec dana da se svi koji su nadležni reaguju, ali da niko nije reagovao. - Zato sam na sednici vlade prošle nedelje predložio da ova saobraćajnica postane državni put, što je vlada prihvatila - rekao je Vesić. Naveo je da će izmenjena uredba stupiti na snagu sledeće subote i da će od tada ovaj put biti državni i u nadležnosti ""Puteva Srbije"". - To znači da ćemo, kada uredba stupi na snagu, zatvoriti bankinu. Ko god da je vlasnik tog parkinga, kome god da preti, na koga god da se poziva, poručujem mu da ćemo zatvoriti bankinu i da više neće ugrožavati saobraćaj - istakao je Vesić. Naveo je da će protiv svih koji su to uradili biti podnete krivične prijave, uključujući i one sa beogradskog aerodroma koji, kako kaže, kao i vlasnik parkinga očigledno misle da mogu da rade šta hoće i da se igraju sa državom. Vesić je ponovio da će bankina biti zatvorena i odgovornima poručio da se ne nadaju da će naći vezu da je ne zatvore pošto su, kako kaže, očigledno za to do sada imali neku vezu. Najavio je da će ubuduće i sve druge saobraćajnice oko aerodroma postati državni putevi i da će se znati red. - Svako ima prvo da posluje u skladu sa zakonom. Mi smo vlada koja štiti preduzetništvo, ali niko nema pravo da krši zakon, da se bahati i preti novinarima, što se desilo novinaru Pinka tokom izveštavanja o ovom divljem parkingu - rekao je Vesić. Istakao je da su svi jednaki pred zakonom i da niko ne može na silu da seče zaštinu ogradu na državnom putu. - Kada preuzmemo taj put, dodatno ćemo ga urediti, a biće napravljen i kružni tok. Na taj način će ovaj problem biti rešen, a moja poruka onima koji su pretili je da će odgovarati po zakonu za ono što su uradili - zaključio je Vesić.

Judge dismisses lawsuit by Musk’s X against nonprofit researchers tracking hate speech on platform,2024-03-25T18:15:40+00:00,https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/technology/3329549/judge-dismisses-lawsuit-by-musks-x-against-nonprofit-researchers-tracking-hate-speech-on-platform.html,"

                                                 Judge dismisses lawsuit by Musk’s X against nonprofit researchers tracking hate speech on platform                                                  A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit by Elon Musk’s X Corp. against the non-profit Center for Countering Digital Hate, which has documented the increase in hate speech on the site since it was acquired by the Tesla owner. X, formerly known as Twitter, had argued the center’s researchers violated the site’s terms of service by improperly compiling public tweets, and that its subsequent reports on the rise of hate speech cost X millions of dollars when advertisers fled. On Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer dismissed the suit, writing in his order that it was “unabashedly and vociferously about one thing” — punishing the nonprofit for its speech.  X had alleged that the nonprofit “scraped” its site for data, which is against its terms of service. But the judge found that X failed to “allege losses based on technological harms” — that is, the company didn’t show how the scraping led to financial losses for X.  X had sought millions of dollars in damages, arguing that the nonprofit’s reports led to the exodus of advertisers and the loss of ad revenue. But the judge agreed with CCDH’s argument saying X cannot seek damages for the independent acts of third parties based on CCDH’s reports, or its “speech.” The center is a nonprofit with offices in the U.S. and United Kingdom. It regularly publishes reports on hate speech, extremism or harmful behavior on social media platforms like X, TikTok or Facebook. The organization has published several reports critical of Musk’s leadership, detailing a rise in anti-LGBTQ hate speech as well as climate misinformation since his purchase.  In a statement posted to X, the social media platform said it “disagrees with the court’s decision and plans to appeal.”  Imran Ahmed, the center’s founder and CEO, said the lawsuit amounted to a “hypocritical campaign of harassment” by a billionaire who talks about protecting free speech but who then uses his wealth to try to silence his critics. He said the lawsuit shows the need for a federal law requiring tech companies to release more information about their operations, so that the public can understand how these powerful platforms are shaping society. “We hope this landmark ruling will embolden public-interest researchers everywhere to continue, and even intensify, their vital work of holding social media companies accountable for the hate and disinformation they host and the harm they cause,” said Ahmed. Roberta Kaplan, the center’s attorney, said the dismissal of X’s suit shows “even the wealthiest man cannot bend the rule of law to his will.” “We are living in an age of bullies, and it’s social media that gives them the power that they have toda...",-1

Sauce Gardner addresses anti-semitic comments: ‘Not what I’m about’,2024-03-26T22:49:55+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/26/sports/sauce-gardner-addresses-anti-semitic-comments-not-what-im-about/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner responded to criticism over controversial remarks that he made about Jewish people during a livestream over the weekend. The incident happened while Gardner was appearing with popular streamer Adin Ross — who is Jewish — and as part of a conversation about Ross’ ability to get a Tesla Cybertruck from another Jewish man, Gardner said “ya’ll run the world.” After receiving backlash online, Gardner tried to clarify the remarks with two separate but similar comments on X, which included him claiming what he had said “was meant to be a good thing.” “I love all people; Including Jewish people,” Gardner first wrote on Tuesday. “The majority of my agency/marketing team are Jewish and I talk to them almost every day. You probably just took what I said the wrong way but what I said was meant to be a good thing.”  Gardner continued to clarify in a second post on X early Tuesday evening. “I love all people. While my intentions were positive, I just learned that people use those exact words I shared for hate towards Jewish people,” he wrote. “That is not what I am about and I appreciate those who took the time to educate me on that fact.” During the original video, which remains up on YouTube, Gardner appeared to show hesitation at first before he made the comments — also adding that, “They got so much motion throughout the whole world.” Ross said he was not offended by the comments and laughed after Gardner had said it. WARNING: Video below contains offensive language  🏈 NY Jets cornerback, Ahmad ""Sauce"" Gardner, tells Adin Ross: ""Y'all [Jews] run the world."" pic.twitter.com/t4n04qhKAb The streaming personality also defended Gardner on X in a reply to the Jets star’s post. “Bro I’m Jewish. You did and said nothing wrong you said Jews run the world in a good way which is true, I said you were fine so ima defend you. Don’t give in, f–k these fake woke ppl,” Ross wrote. Gardner is going into his third season with the Jets and was named an All-Pro and Pro Bowler during his first two seasons with the team. He is also a former Defensive Rookie of the Year.  ",0

Tesla’s Game-Changing Model 2: Market Share Could Skyrocket!,2024-03-26T22:09:00+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/teslas-game-changing-model-2-market-share-could-skyrocket/,"In a landscape increasingly defined by the pursuit of sustainability and innovation, Tesla’s forthcoming Model 2 promises to be a watershed moment in the electric vehicle (EV) revolution. Amid fervent anticipation, industry experts and enthusiasts alike are abuzz with speculation about its transformative potential. At the heart of the excitement lies Tesla’s groundbreaking new battery technology, poised to redefine the parameters of EV performance and accessibility. With Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the helm, the company is poised to unleash a paradigm-shifting battery that promises unparalleled efficiency and range. According to Tony Seba, a prominent industry analyst, the impending release of Tesla’s Model 2 and its revolutionary battery technology is set to catalyze a seismic shift in the EV market landscape. Seba predicts that upon the Model 2’s debut, the EV market share in the United States could skyrocket, potentially reaching unprecedented levels within months.  “It’s not just about introducing a new vehicle; it’s about ushering in a new era of electric mobility,” Seba remarked, emphasizing Tesla’s innovative approach’s transformative impact. Central to Tesla’s strategy is its collaboration with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL), the world’s largest battery manufacturer. By harnessing CATL’s cutting-edge lithium phosphate battery technology, Tesla aims to raise the bar for EV performance and charging capabilities. “The lithium phosphate batteries that CATL is producing are nothing short of game-changing,” asserted Sam Evans, founder of The Electric Viking. “With faster charging times, enhanced energy density, and improved cold-weather performance, these batteries represent a quantum leap forward in EV technology.” Tesla’s investment in domestic battery production infrastructure underscores its commitment to innovation and self-sufficiency. By leveraging idle CATL equipment in its Nevada Gigafactory, Tesla is poised to lead the charge in domestic EV battery manufacturing and ensure a seamless transition to next-generation battery technology. Another industry analyst noted, “Tesla’s strategic investment in battery production reflects its commitment to driving sustainable transportation solutions.” “By establishing a robust domestic supply chain, Tesla is poised to maintain its competitive edge in the rapidly evolving EV market.” As anticipation mounts for the Model 2’s release, industry observers remain eager to witness the transformative impact of Tesla’s latest innovation. With its promise of affordability, performance, and sustainability, the Model 2 represents a bold leap forward in Tesla’s quest to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. “The Model 2 isn’t just a car; it’s a catalyst for change,” remarked Evans. “As Tesla continues to push the boundaries of innovation, the future of electric mobility has never looked brighter.”  Get the free daily newsletter read by decision makers Get our media kit Deliver ...",3

 Wall Street slipped a bit further from its record heights. The S&P 500 fell 0.3% Tuesday for its third straight modest drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.4%.  Stock indexes were up for much of the day, thanks to gains for Tesla and other Big Tech stocks. But a late-day drop for Nvidia ended up helping to pull the overall market lower. Trump Media & Technology Group jumped 16% in its first day of trading under the ticker symbol that uses former President Donald Trump’s initials. Treasury yields slipped following mixed economic reports. On Tuesday: The S&P 500 fell 14.61 points, or 0.3%, to 5,203.58. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.31 points, or 0.1%, to 39,282.33.

Elon Musk Buys Tesla Ads For the First Time Ever—on Social Platforms He Hated,2024-03-27T17:40:21+00:00,https://observer.com/2024/03/elon-musk-buys-tesla-ads-first-time/,"Tesla (TSLA) became the largest electric carmaker in the world without ever spending a dime on advertising or marketing because it never had to. But as sales slow down and investors lose confidence, Elon Musk is buying advertisements on major social media platforms for the first time. 
					Thank you for signing up!

You can opt out anytime.				 Facebook (Meta (META)) and Instagram users noticed this week that Tesla ads promoting its Model Y electric car appeared on their timelines. The move surprised many because Musk has a history of disliking Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg—to a point where Musk ordered to delete Tesla’s Facebook page in 2018 and called the platform “lame” in 2020.  In addition, Tesla also recently began running ads on TikTok, Google’s YouTube and X—controversial because Musk owns both Tesla and the platform its cars are being advertised on.  Tesla stock enjoyed astronomic growth during the pandemic years. But in 2024 so far, it is one of the worst-performing stocks among S&P 500 companies. Shares are down nearly 28 percent since January and are trading at less than half their peak price in November 2021. Its latest quarterly earnings report in January showed that the company brought less revenue and profit than Wall Street analysts had expected in the last three months of 2023. Musk has a complicated relationship with the ad market beyond refusing to buy ads for Tesla in the past. As the owner of X, formerly Twitter, the tech billionaire is very much in the ad business himself. Since taking over X, Musk has turned off advertisers on the platform by placing some of their ads next to antisemitic posts. He has hired Linda Yaccarino, the former advertising chief at NBCUniversal, in hopes to turn around X’s advertising business.  We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

Analysts Sound Alarm on Tesla: “Code Red”,2024-03-28T21:01:32+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/analysts-sound-alarm-on-tesla-code-red/,"In a turn of events that has sent shockwaves through the market, Tesla, Inc., is grappling with a storm of challenges, prompting analysts to paint a grim picture for the electric vehicle giant’s immediate future. Renowned analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities, a figure well-versed in the intricacies of the market, recently made headlines by revising Tesla’s price target downward. While such a move might appear counterintuitive amidst the company’s seemingly high-flying stock prices, Ives underscores a troubling reality: Tesla’s stock, currently trading at $175, falls far short of his initial target of $315 per share. “This is a code red situation for Tesla,” Ives warns, pointing to the company’s struggles in China as a primary cause for concern. The narrative surrounding Tesla’s performance in the Chinese market has taken a sharp turn, with demand plummeting unexpectedly. “We originally had that [demand] up 3% to 4%; it will be down 3% to 4%,” Ives laments. The situation in China once hailed as a bastion of growth for Tesla, has become a battleground marked by aggressive pricing wars among electric vehicle manufacturers. Tesla’s inability to navigate this landscape effectively has resulted in a significant dent in its once-soaring prospects.  Tesla’s leadership’s lack of clear guidance and strategy has exacerbated investor concerns. With the departure of key executives, including the Chief Financial Officer, in August, Tesla’s ability to weather the storm has come into question. “Since they lost their CFO in August, it has been a nightmare on Elm Street conference call,” Ives remarks, highlighting the lack of clarity and direction emanating from Tesla’s executive suite. However, despite the prevailing darkness, Ives remains cautiously optimistic about Tesla’s long-term prospects. “We’re between two growth waves,” he explains, alluding to the potential for substantial growth in the future. Nonetheless, he warns that the immediate future could be fraught with challenges unless Tesla takes decisive action to address its current predicament. Tesla’s stock, once the darling of Wall Street, now faces a reckoning as it navigates turbulent waters. As investors brace for what promises to be a tumultuous period, Tesla’s fate hangs in the balance, with analysts closely watching for signs of a turnaround or further descent into darkness. In response to queries about Tesla’s performance and future trajectory, CEO Elon Musk has remained characteristically enigmatic, offering little reassurance to investors. With the company’s quarterly results looming on the horizon, all eyes are on Tesla as it grapples with the harsh realities of the market and strives to emerge from the shadows cast over its once-bright future.

A large non-profit has been obtaining Tesla battery packs and getting them into Ukraine for when Russia knocks out the electricity. The Federal Drive with Tom Temin was curious about how an operation like that works. How does it maneuver around military operations and stay on the good side of the State Department and other agencies that may be operating there? For more, Tom spoke with the President and CEO of Direct Relief, Thomas Tighe. Interview Transcript:   Thomas Tighe Direct relief is providing a lot of medical material aid to Ukraine, but the most recent activity has been a significant investment of over 2000 battery systems to backstop the Ukrainian health system. That was their priority. And, you know, like any health system, when the power goes out, it’s unable to function and perform the basic services. And that was a priority. So, it was what Direct Relief stepped up to and has done this month, I think is said we continued over $1 billion of medical material aid since the war began. This power issue has become an emergent crisis, really, for the Ukrainian health care system as they’re deep into the war now. Tom Temin And maybe give us a little bit of background on the organization itself. Direct Relief.         Join WTOP the week of Apr. 22 for an exclusive series bringing together government and industry experts to share initiatives and insights about efforts to transform the nation's energy infrastructure. | Register today! Thomas Tighe Well, Direct Relief is a nonprofit humanitarian health care organization that works in all 50 U.S. states and about 100 countries each year. Its principal focus is to provide medical material, medications, vaccines, medical supplies that are needed but can’t be afforded for the people who need them. So that’s the typical role that Direct Relief has played for 75 years. We’re secular, entirely privately financed and an apolitical organization. So, it’s just purely a humanitarian health care organization. And Ukraine has been the largest single effort that we’ve undertaken in 75 years, just because of the need and the proximity to Europe, where we’re set up and have been able to provide a lot. But this entry into the power sector, at least for health, is something that’s relatively new for Direct Relief. We see it much more typically in the aftermath of an emergency natural disaster like Hurricane Maria, but increasingly we’re all becoming more dependent on power for the medical devices, either at home or in a facility. While power is becoming less reliable, more frequent outages often brought about by climate issues. But for Ukraine, obviously brought about by a different cause but same effect on health.

Leaked Specifications Surface for Tesla Model 3 Ludicrous,2024-03-29T22:02:21+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/leaked-specifications-surface-for-tesla-model-3-ludicrous/,"In the world of Tesla enthusiasts, anticipation often reaches a fever pitch with the slightest hint of new developments. Recently, Dennis of the DennisCW YouTube Channel, a prominent Tesla enthusiast known for his in-depth analyses, took to his platform to dissect a leaked spec list for the highly anticipated Model 3 Ludicrous edition, igniting excitement among fans and enthusiasts alike. The leaked document, of undisclosed origin, offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential features and upgrades of the Model 3 Ludicrous. As Dennis meticulously breaks down each detail, it becomes clear that Tesla may be gearing up to deliver an electrifying driving experience. One of the most notable revelations from the leaked list is the inclusion of an adaptive suspension system, a feature that promises to enhance the vehicle’s handling and performance. With the ability to adjust damping in real-time, drivers can expect a smoother ride and improved control, especially during spirited driving.  But perhaps the most thrilling aspect of the leaked specifications is the rear motor, boasting a staggering 958 horsepower—a significant upgrade that promises exhilarating acceleration and unmatched power. Combined with Tesla’s renowned electric drivetrain technology, the Model 3 Ludicrous is poised to deliver a truly electrifying driving experience. In addition to performance upgrades, the leaked document hints at several luxury features that will delight Tesla enthusiasts. Among these are ventilated seats, a welcome addition that promises to keep occupants comfortable during long drives and hot summer days, and such premium amenities further cement Tesla’s commitment to providing a first-class driving experience for its customers. But the leaked specifications reveal more than just performance and luxury—the document also sheds light on the vehicle’s battery technology. With a robust Panasonic battery boasting an estimated capacity of 82 Kow, the Model 3 Ludicrous is expected to offer impressive range and endurance, making it an ideal choice for long-distance driving and daily commutes. Accompanying these performance and technology upgrades are several aesthetic enhancements that add to the vehicle’s overall appeal. From sleek 20-inch wheels to eye-catching red brake calipers, every detail has been carefully considered to elevate the Model 3 Ludicrous to new heights of style and sophistication. As Dennis delves deeper into the leaked specifications, he speculates on the potential release date of the Model 3 Ludicrous, suggesting that it could hit the market sooner than expected. Rumors of media test drives and a possible April release date have only added to the excitement surrounding Tesla’s latest offering, leaving enthusiasts eagerly awaiting further updates and announcements from the electric car manufacturer. In the meantime, discussions around the leaked specifications continue circulating within the Tesla community, with enthusiasts speculating on everything...",3

Three significant improvements to FSD will roll out roughly every two weeks. Should be really shining bright by late April or early May.

I just got the 12.3.2.1 FSD and am trying it. Without setting a destination it does not know where I am going, so I disengage so I can finish the drive. I am building trust in the system, so in scary situations I disengage some times. I disengage for dips in the road that it wants to traverse too fast (for me). Do these all count towards too many? On my first day of testing 12.3.2.1 there was only one disengagement for safety where the car seemed like would crawl into a trailer blocking part of a left hand turn lane. At this point I am very impressed with FSD 12.3.x. It is NOT FSD yet but is very impressive.

"Smartphone maker Xiaomi switches from Apple to Tesla challenger as its first EV racks up 120,000 orders in 36 hours",2024-03-30T21:55:58+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/03/30/xiaomi-from-apple-to-tesla-challenger-electric-vehicles-su7-launch/,"Anyone who’s tried a Xiaomi smartphone knows it’s a worthy competitor to the iPhone. Now the question is, will Xiaomi present the same kind of challenge to Tesla as to Apple?  On Thursday, the Chinese juggernaut launched its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan. Billionaire founder and CEO Lei Jun—a household name in China—said at the presentation in Beijing, “Many people ask me who the Xiaomi SU7 is built for. My answer is, isn’t it time for Tesla Model 3 users to upgrade?” The entry of yet another deep-pocketed rival in China comes at a difficult time for Elon Musk’s carmaker. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Tesla had reduced EV production at its Shanghai factory amid intense competition and sluggish growth in China. Tesla’s market cap has fallen about 30% this year, spurring the company to scrap Musk’s no-advertising mantra. Tesla also faces competition from China’s Warren Buffett–backed BYD, which dethroned it a few months ago as the world’s top EV seller. Of course, Tesla has already proved itself as a leading EV maker, while Xiaomi is new in the space. “In the three years of developing this car, my biggest realization is that making cars is extremely difficult,” Lei said on Thursday. “Even a giant like Apple gave up on it.” In February, Lei responded to Apple ending its EV project, saying he was “shocked” by the decision. He’s cited Apple cofounder Steve Jobs as a primary inspiration to become an entrepreneur. Xiaomi, which also makes smart TVs and home appliances, enjoys Apple-like popularity in China. Lei claimed on Thursday that the SU7, available only in China to start, beats the Tesla Model 3 on 90% of specifications, with Xiaomi needing a few more years to catch up on the rest. He said the sedan had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus 606 for the Model 3. The base model will sell for under $30,000, cheaper than the Model 3 in China. Lei admitted his company will be losing money on every vehicle it sells for the time being. In December, he said that Xiaomi would spend 10 times the labor and investment carmakers usually commit to a new model. But, he added on Thursday, “Xiaomi has enough cash reserves to cope with any fierce competition in the next five years.”  Time will tell if Lei made the right call by entering the EV market or if Xiaomi should have veered away as Apple did. Plenty of EV startups once valued in the billions are now struggling. “The risk is that they focus too much on the EV space and lose focus on the sectors and products that got them there,” Tu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, told Reuters. But Xiaomi is off to a strong start, at least, with the company reporting that it had received 120,000 firm orders for the SU7 in 36 hours, meaning this year’s production capacity is sold out. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Tesla’s Triumph: A Deep Dive into Elon Musk’s Unparalleled Leadership,2024-03-30T13:43:32+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/teslas-triumph-a-deep-dive-into-elon-musks-unparalleled-leadership/,"In modern business, where innovation reigns supreme and disruption is the norm, few figures loom as large as Elon Musk. The enigmatic CEO of Tesla Inc. has long been a polarizing figure, drawing both adoration and criticism in equal measure. Yet, as the electric vehicle giant continues defying expectations and pushing the boundaries of technology, Musk’s leadership style and vision for the future are under renewed scrutiny. Recently, in an episode of the popular All-In podcast, billionaire investor Brad Gerstner, known for his occasional appearances and astute insights, shared his thoughts on Tesla’s trajectory in China and the company’s unique position in the market. Gerstner, who manages close to $20 billion through Altimatic Capital, didn’t mince words when discussing Tesla’s recent challenges, particularly its lagging electric vehicle sales in China. However, his perspective on the company’s future was decidedly bullish, citing Tesla’s innovative approach to self-driving technology as a critical driver of its long-term success. “It’s certainly the worst of the mega caps if you want to still call it that year to date,” Gerstner remarked candidly. “But you start with probably the best product engineer CEO on the planet. When everybody else is negative about things like negative on Google, negative on Tesla, that’s when we start getting excited.”  Gerstner’s optimism stems from Tesla’s groundbreaking advancements in full self-driving (FSD) technology, particularly with the release of FSD version 12. He highlighted Tesla’s shift to an imitation learning model and its ability to simulate human driving behavior as a game-changer in the autonomous vehicle space. Moreover, Gerstner emphasized the revenue potential of Tesla’s FSD subscription model, likening it to Apple’s successful transition to subscription-based services. But Gerstner isn’t the only voice singing Tesla’s praises. Antonio Gracias of Equity Partners echoed similar sentiments, praising Musk’s unparalleled engineering prowess and unique management style. Gracias, whose firm manages assets close to $20 billion, lauded Musk’s ability to marshal top engineering talent and drive innovation across multiple disciplines. “It’s like watching Michael Jordan play basketball times 10,” Gracias remarked, recalling a moment when Musk personally intervened to optimize production efficiency during the early days of Tesla’s Model S ramp-up. Meanwhile, former Tesla engineer Andrej Karpathy illuminated Musk’s hands-on approach to management, describing Tesla as “the biggest startup.” Karpathy emphasized Musk’s preference for small, highly technical teams and his willingness to swiftly remove underperformers—a stark contrast to the bureaucratic red tape often found in larger corporations. However, amidst the chorus of praise for Musk and Tesla’s innovative spirit, not all voices sing harmoniously. Some money managers, disillusioned by Tesla’s recent stock performance, have taken a more skeptical stance, ...",2

Tesla Triumphs as Neo Falters: Electric Shockwaves Rock Danish Market,2024-03-31T20:12:57+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/tesla-triumphs-as-neo-falters-electric-shockwaves-rock-danish-market/,"In the ever-evolving landscape of electric vehicles (EVs), the narrative has often centered around industry disruptors like Tesla, hailed for innovation and market dominance. However, according to The Electric Viking, a surprising turn of events has unfolded amidst this backdrop, highlighting the challenges other players face in the field, notably Neo, a Chinese electric car manufacturer. Neo’s CEO has garnered attention with his outspoken criticism of Tesla, dismissing Tesla’s electric cars as subpar and questioning their long-term viability. Such remarks have not only sparked debate but also underscored the competitive dynamics within the EV market. However, recent developments in Denmark have shadowed Neo’s prospects, prompting reflection on the company’s strategic decisions and market positioning. Neo’s foray into Denmark initially held promise, with ambitions to carve out a niche in a market increasingly receptive to electric mobility. Yet, despite investing significant resources, the results have been underwhelming. Neo grappled with a stark reality with a mere 60 cars sold over nearly two years: its premium offerings failed to resonate with Danish consumers, who overwhelmingly embraced Tesla’s more affordable alternatives.  The decision to exit Denmark altogether, accompanied by the dismissal of all local staff, underscores the magnitude of Neo’s miscalculation. While the company seeks to frame this move as part of a broader European expansion strategy, it raises questions about its ability to navigate diverse markets effectively. Furthermore, Neo’s CEO’s penchant for publicly disparaging competitors, notably Tesla, adds another layer of complexity to the company’s image and reputation. In contrast to Neo’s struggles, Tesla’s meteoric rise in Denmark is a testament to its unwavering appeal and market dominance. With record-breaking sales and a burgeoning network of supercharging stations, Tesla has emerged as the undisputed leader in the country’s EV landscape. Its ability to offer competitive pricing and a robust infrastructure ecosystem has solidified its position as the brand of choice for Danish consumers. The divergence in fortunes between Neo and Tesla highlights the importance of understanding local market dynamics and tailoring strategies accordingly. While Neo may boast a loyal following and a lineup of high-quality vehicles, its failure to resonate with Danish consumers underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to international expansion. Moreover, the CEO’s aggressive stance towards competitors risks alienating potential customers and undermining Neo’s credibility in the eyes of investors and industry observers. As the EV market continues to evolve, with new players entering the fray and existing contenders vying for supremacy, Neo’s case serves as a cautionary tale. In an industry defined by innovation and disruption, success hinges on technological prowess, strategic foresight, and market understanding. Only time will t...",2

TechCrunch Mobility: Fisker enters into dumpster fire territory and Tesla chases FSD revenue,2024-03-31T19:00:27+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/31/techcrunch-mobility-03-31-24/,"TechCrunch Mobility is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. Sign up here — just click TechCrunch Mobility — to receive the newsletter every weekend in your inbox. Subscribe for free. Welcome back to TechCrunch Mobility — your central hub for news and insights on the future of transportation. Remember in the last edition of TechCrunch Mobility, when I wrote that the wheels were starting to come off the Fisker bus? Sheesh. Did they. To catch you up: Fisker issued a warning on March 18 that it was pausing production for six weeks and had just $121 million in cash and cash equivalents, $32 million of which was restricted or not immediately accessible. The company was counting on a $150 million influx of capital via convertible notes and a potential partnership with another automaker. Those hopes incinerated as fast as a gasoline-soaked rag when negotiations between Fisker and the large automaker — reported to be Nissan — fell apart and put that convertible note deal in jeopardy. Shares plummeted 28%, trading was halted, and in a final blow, the New York Stock Exchange said it was taking steps to remove Fisker from the exchange. Those are all symptoms of a bigger problem within the company, including one particularly embarrassing one that TC reporter Sean O’Kane uncovered. The tl;dr: Fisker temporarily lost track of millions of dollars in customer payments as it scaled up deliveries, leading to an internal audit that started in December and took months to complete. Alrighty, let’s jump into the rest of it, including where bankrupt EV startup Arrival’s assets ended up, a profile on startup Ionobell hoping to increase EV range through recycled silicon battery materials, and a $1 billion boost for Lucid.  Founders, investors, engineers, policy wonks and others tell us things. And we’re here to pass along the verifiable information that those little birds have shared with us. Got a tip for us?

It ain’t easy being an executive at an EV startup these days. Just ask the folks at Fisker. (Sorry, too soon?) Amid all of the EV startup bankruptcies and other bleak goings-on, there was a bit of positive news. Lucid, which has had its own struggles, raised another $1 billion from its biggest financial backer, Saudi Arabia. Ayar Third Investment, an affiliate of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, agreed to buy $1 billion worth of Lucid’s stock, which will add to the Kingdom’s current stake of around 60% ownership. The $1 billion boost is a lot of money, but it doesn’t last long if you’re trying to design, manufacture, sell and service vehicles. This gives Lucid an important capital buffer; however, it does not end it’s existential crisis. The company must successfully bring its next vehicle, the Gra...",0

Tesla: Judge shoots down car maker’s defenses in Fremont factory racism lawsuit,2024-04-01T22:54:29+00:00,https://www.siliconvalley.com/2024/04/01/tesla-judge-shoots-down-car-makers-defenses-in-fremont-factory-racism-lawsuit/,"Today's E-Edition Morning Report in your inbox!  Morning Report in your inbox! Today's E-Edition A federal court judge has shot down Tesla’s bid to escape a lawsuit by the federal government that alleges widespread racism at the company’s Fremont electric car factory. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued Tesla in September, claiming Black workers were subjected to racial harassment that was “frequent, ongoing, inappropriate, unwelcome and occurred across all shifts, departments, and positions.” Tesla in late December filed a motion to dismiss the case, but a judge on Friday rejected the company’s arguments. Judge Jacqueline Corley, in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, noted that the commission alleged Black workers were addressed using a racial slur, that racial slurs and insults were used openly, and anti-Black graffiti, including swastikas and nooses, was scrawled on desks, elevators, bathrooms and equipment. Tesla, the commission alleged, knew about the abuse but failed to take action to end it. Tesla, and lawyers representing the company in the case, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Corley shot down Tesla’s argument that because the commission did not identify any victims or perpetrators, or provide dates for purported racist incidents, it could not make valid legal claims about a hostile work environment. The judge ruled that there was no need to identify those involved or provide dates because the commission was bringing the action on its own behalf, and was not representing particular people. “The Commission’s factual allegations are sufficient to support the inference the alleged racial harassment was sufficiently severe to pollute Tesla’s Fremont factory and create an abusiveworkplace for Black employees,” Corley wrote. Tesla had also denied Black workers suffered retaliation for complaining about racial harassment. Corley cited the commission’s claims that Tesla fired Black workers within weeks of their complaints about the racial harassment, reassigned a Black employee to a more demanding part of the assembly line after she reported her supervisor for racial harassment, and repeatedly wrote up another employee after they complained of racial harassment. Those allegations were enough to infer that the actions taken against the workers were linked to their complaints, Corley wrote. Related Articles

Warren Buffett-backed EV maker BYD surprises with stellar first quarter sales as Tesla continues to slide,2024-04-01T22:25:49+00:00,https://fortune.com/2024/04/01/warren-buffett-byd-surprises-tesla-slide/,"Chinese carmaker BYD is gaining momentum in the increasingly competitive global EV race, while the dominance of longtime leader Tesla wanes. The Warren Buffett–backed carmaker on Monday reported a 13% year-over-year increase in “new-energy” vehicle sales, which includes both electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. In total, the company sold 626,263 vehicles in the first quarter, of which about 300,114 were pure EVs. Although the first two months of the year saw sales slip, purchases jumped 46% in March, the company said. BYD’s strong first-quarter performance contrasts with plummeting expectations for Elon Musk–owned EV maker Tesla, whose stock has dropped nearly 30% year to date. Several analysts have revised down their projections for the company’s first-quarter vehicle deliveries (an approximate gauge for sales), after reports of a cutback in production at Tesla’s factory in Shanghai.  Wedbush Securities cut its estimate to 425,968 from about 475,000. If Wedbush’s prediction is accurate, Tesla’s vehicle deliveries will have grown less than 1% year over year, but would still be higher than BYD’s pure EV sales during the same period. Tesla is set to report its first-quarter vehicle deliveries on Tuesday. Despite years of strong growth, Tesla has faced increasing competition from Chinese automakers, including BYD. The carmaker late last year surpassed Tesla for the first time as the world’s biggest EV seller on a quarterly basis. The global EV race has started to heat up, especially as lower-priced vehicles from China make headway overseas, much to the dismay of Western governments and established carmakers such as Nissan and Honda as well as Tesla. Besides BYD, Chinese carmakers such as Li Auto, Nio, and Xpeng also reported sales rebounds in March after a weaker start to the year.  Tesla critics and bulls alike have begun to sound the alarm about the company’s performance, including Wedbush’s Dan Ives, who said in an interview with CNBC last week that the company is in a “code red situation.” Ives reiterated his outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $300. The stock was trading at about $175 on Tuesday. To boost sales, Tesla recently shed its aversion to digital advertising. Musk has also promised many of its customers a free trial of its $12,000-per-year “full self-driving” mode to help add more subscribers. Still, Musk has cautioned investors that Tesla will likely face “notably lower” sales growth this year. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Canadian accused of using Tesla tech to start China-based company released on bail in U.S.,2024-04-01T21:58:44+00:00,https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/canadian-accused-of-using-tesla-tech-to-start-china-based-company-released-on-bail-in-u-s-1.6829478,"
	A Canadian entrepreneur in China accused of stealing battery manufacturing technology from Tesla has been released on bail in the United States. 
	Klaus Pflugbeil, a Canadian citizen living in Ningbo, China, had a bond hearing on March 22 and was released on bail March 28, according to information provided by Danielle Hass, spokesperson for the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, in an email to CTVNews.ca on Monday. 
	The court set the bond at US$1 million, with two properties posted and US$150,000 cash deposited with the clerk of the court. 
	""The defendants set up a company in China, blatantly stole trade secrets from an American company that are important to manufacturing electric vehicles, and which cost many millions of dollars in research and development, and sold products developed with the stolen trade secrets,"" Breon Peace, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement last month. 
	Pflugbeil was arrested on March 19 on Long Island, N.Y., after he allegedly sent multiple trade secrets to an undercover agent. He is accused of travelling to Nassau County, N.Y., believing he would meet with businesspeople who were actually undercover federal law enforcement agents, according to U.S. prosecutors in a press release that day. 
	Pflugbeil and Yilong Shao, a Chinese national, were charged with conspiring to send trade secrets that belonged to a ""leading U.S.-based electric vehicle company,"" wrote the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. They face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. 
	Shao of Ningbo, remains at large, U.S. authorities said. 
	U.S. prosecutors did not name the company but The Associated Press reported it was Tesla. When asked to confirm whether it was Tesla, Hass said she ""cannot confirm or deny anything outside of the indictment and public record."" She said no trial date is set yet. 
	Pflugbeil and Shao operated a China-based business that sold technology used to make batteries, including for electric vehicles, according to court documents. 
	They built their business using a U.S. electric vehicle company's ""sensitive and proprietary information,"" marketing it as a replacement for the products, according to the release from prosecutors. 
	Before starting their own business in China, the two men worked at a Canadian company that created the technology, read the release. That company was bought by a leading U.S. maker of battery-powered electric vehicles and battery energy systems in 2019, according to prosecutors. 
	Although prosecutors didn't name the companies, Tesla bought Hibar Systems, a battery manufacturing firm in Richmond Hill, Ont., in 2019. Electric Autonomy Canada first reported the deal. 
	Tesla didn't immediately return CTVNews.ca's request for comment.

Buttigieg schools Fox News reporter upset Biden is 'shoving' EVs 'down consumers’ throats',2024-04-02T22:55:01+00:00,https://www.alternet.org/buttigieg-fox-news/,"U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg explained why President Joe Biden is enthusiastically pushing for more electric vehicles, and it’s not just for environmental reasons. Fox News’ John Roberts, talking about Tesla’s deep sales plunge, on Tuesday noted the electric vehicle (EV) maker’s “sales fell 8.5% the first quarter of this year, Ford this week is laying off two-thirds of its workforce at the F-150 Electric Lightning plant. It’s also scaling back a battery production facility because of sagging sales. EV sales are nowhere near what this president wanted or expected, yet the administration continues to shove them down consumers’ throats. Why?” “Well, let’s be clear,” Buttigieg responded. “Consumers have wanted and purchased more EVs every single year than the year before. And you know, Tesla is facing more competition as GM and Ford and Stellantis and other competitive players start to make sure they get a piece of the EV market.” READ MORE: Florida in Play? Biden and Strategists Say Yes as Court Puts Abortion, Marijuana on Ballot “Let’s be clear that the automotive sector is moving toward EVs, and we can’t pretend otherwise,” the Secretary continued. “Sometimes when these debates happen, I feel like it’s the early 2000s and I’m talking to some people who think that we can just have landline phones forever. The reality is that the automotive sector is moving toward EVs, and the U.S. can either fall behind China or we can claim the lead.” “President Biden wants to make sure that those EVs are made in America, especially again, as more Americans choose EVs every single year than the year before. We’ve got to make sure that those those are made on American soil in places like Northern Indiana where I grew up places like Michigan where I live right now. During the Trump administration, China was really able to build an advantage in the EV market, obviously not because there are big environmental silver in China, but just because that’s the economically smart play. We’ve been working to make sure that that advantage comes back onto American soil.” Watch below or at this link.

 Tesla sales fell sharply last quarter as competition increased worldwide, electric vehicle sales growth slowed, and price cuts failed to lure more buyers. The Austin, Texas, company said Tuesday that it delivered 386,810 vehicles worldwide from January through March, almost 9% below the 423,000 it sold in the same quarter of last year. It was the first year-over-year quarterly sales decline in nearly four years.  Sales also fell short of even the most bearish Wall Street expectations. Auto industry analysts polled by FactSet were looking for 457,000 vehicle deliveries from Tesla Inc. That's a shortfall of more than 15%.  The company blamed the decline in part on phasing in an updated version of the Model 3 sedan at its Fremont, California, factory, plant shutdowns due to shipping diversions in the Red Sea, and an arson attack that knocked out power to its German factory. But TD Cowen Analyst Jeffrey Osborne wrote in a note to investors that weaker March sales indicate that incentives, including discounts and a free trial of “Full Self Driving” software, “did not work as demand deteriorated.” Despite the sales decline, Tesla was able to retake its global EV sales crown from China's BYD, which sold just over 300,000 electric vehicles during the quarter, Osborne wrote.  In its letter to investors in January, Tesla predicted “notably lower” sales growth this year. The letter said Tesla is between two big growth waves, one from global expansion of the Models 3 and Y, and a second coming from the Model 2, a new, smaller and less expensive vehicle with an unknown release date. “This was an unmitigated disaster 1Q that is hard to explain away,” wrote Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush who has been very bullish on Tesla's stock. The drop in sales was far worse than expected, he wrote in a note to investors. The quarter is a “seminal moment” in the Tesla growth story, Ives wrote, adding that CEO Elon Musk will have to turn the company around. “Otherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative.” Ives maintained his Outperform rating on Tesla's shares and cut his one-year price target from $315 to $300. Ives estimated that China sales slid 3% to 4% during the period. Shares of Tesla tumbled 4.9% to close Tuesday at $166.63, continuing an extended decline. Investors have shaved 33% off the value of the company so far this year, dumping shares after growing leery of the tremendous growth story that Tesla has been telling. “Street criticism is warranted as growth has been sluggish and (profit) margins showing compression, with China a horror show and competition increasing from all angles,” Ives wrote.  Tesla dramatically lowered U.S. prices by up to $20,000 for some models last year. In March it temporarily kno...",-3

Tesla founder Musk’s having a terrible year,2024-04-03T22:00:58+00:00,https://www.herald.co.zw/tesla-founder-musks-having-a-terrible-year/,"s  It seems like he’s been taking blow after blow — from a judge striking down his US$55 billion pay package in January to Tesla’s difficult first quarter. Musk’s golden child, Tesla, has been facing headwinds in recent months. On Tuesday, the electric-car maker’s first-quarter delivery numbers revealed a significant slump — well below Wall Street’s lowest estimates.  Tesla deliveries in the first quarter fell 20 percent from the previous quarter and over 8 percent from the same time the previous year, marking the company’s first year-on-year sales decline since 2020. In a press release, Tesla blamed the decline in deliveries on its production ramp for its refreshed Model 3, as well as an arson attack at its factory in Berlin and supply-chain issues caused by the Red Sea conflict. Dan Ives, a Wedbush tech analyst, said in a note Tuesday that the carmaker’s first quarter had been an “unmitigated disaster” and a “nightmare” for Tesla.  It faces mounting competition in the Chinese electric-vehicle market, including from BYD, which has been vying with Tesla for the title of top EV seller. Ives, a longtime Tesla bull, said in his note that the company could face “darker days ahead” if Musk couldn’t turn it around and regain investor confidence. In the US, Musk’s company is facing softening demand from consumers, who appear to be growing increasingly irked by Musk’s antics. A recent report from the market-intelligence firm Caliber found that the number of people surveyed who’d consider buying a Tesla fell to 31 percent in February — that’s down from a high of 70 percent in November 2021. “The issue around Twitter and Elon’s personal views on politics and other things in the world have really turned off a lot of potential buyers,” Colin Rusch, an Oppenheimer stock analyst, told CNBC on Tuesday. “Folks that had been buying EVs specifically around climate are backing away from buying Tesla.” For his part, Musk has said Tesla is “between two major growth waves.” But it’s unclear when the automaker will step out of the slump. The Tesla CEO has said “we dug our own grave” with the production ramp-up of its first truck, the Cybertruck, and he’s already making plans for what sounds like an increasingly ambitious second-generation Tesla Roadster. More bad news Tesla isn’t the only spot of bad news for Musk. The billionaire has been facing headwinds on multiple fronts. Since the year started, Musk’s fortune, which is largely based on his Tesla holdings, has dropped US$40,5 billion, or 17,7 percent, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Thus far, Musk’s purchase of Twitter doesn’t appear to be going according to plan. In February, Fidelity once again lowered the value of its stake in Musk’s social-media company — the drop amounts to an about 73 percent decline in the site’s value since Musk bought Twitter in 2022 for US$44 billion.

This Lucid Electric Coupe Concept Is The Telsa Roadster Rival The EV World Needs,2024-04-03T17:20:14+00:00,https://www.slashgear.com/1554429/lucid-electric-coupe-concept-tesla-roadster-rival/,"
EV manufacturer Lucid has collaborated with students from the Academy of Art University School of Industrial Design to produce what is one of the most exciting concept vehicles we've seen in a while. The futuristic coupe looks like a four-wheeled version of something from the movie ""TRON,"" with translucent bodywork, sleek lines, and what appears to be a holographic dash. There's even a pet door you can pop open should your fluffy companion want to come along for the ride.





It is worth noting that Lucid itself didn't design this concept; the manufacturer is overseeing a competition entered by some of the university's design students. The contest will take place over 90 days and include several visits from Lucid's expert design team, who will give feedback to the entrants. The concept is the work of Jaichen (Justin) Xu, and hopefully, the collaboration will produce many more models like it.

Academy of Art University

As for whether we'll see any of this on the road, Lucid's line is pretty optimistic. Derek Jenkins, Lucid's SVP of Design and Brand, says: ""This collaboration is a testament to our commitment to harnessing this energy and creativity. By challenging students to reimagine the future of mobility, we can unlock exciting new ideas in vehicle design, functionality, and sustainability, ensuring that we continue to lead in the creation of cutting-edge, luxury electric vehicles."" But given the fact that most truly exciting concept cars never make it into production anyway, pessimism is acceptable. However, it should, as this exciting new concept is exactly what the EV market needs.

Munster: Tesla Remains at the Forefront of the EV Revolution,2024-04-04T20:52:25+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/munster-tesla-remains-at-the-forefront-of-the-ev-revolution/,"In a surprising turn of events, Tesla, the electric vehicle (EV) pioneer, fell short of delivery expectations, causing a seismic shift in investor sentiment and raising questions about the company’s trajectory. The unexpected miss, highlighted by a 6% drop in Tesla’s stock price, underscores the challenges facing the EV market amid broader economic uncertainties and shifting consumer preferences. During a recent discussion on Bloomberg,” Gene Munster, an iconic figure at Deepwater Asset Management, dissected the implications of Tesla’s disappointing performance. Munster characterized the miss as “surprising” and “borderline unprecedented,” attributing it to a combination of factors, including a slowdown in the broader EV market and a possible saturation of demand due to earlier excitement around EVs. According to Munster, “It was a soft number… a surprising, borderline unprecedented miss relative to expectations.” He added, “I think the big picture is around this; it’s just relative to consumers’ appetite for EVs, and we’ve seen it, especially in the US, that has slowed.”  The sharp decline in Tesla’s stock price and concerns about the company’s future prompted speculation about potential strategic shifts. However, Munster expressed confidence in Tesla’s long-term vision, suggesting that any adjustments to the company’s strategy would likely be minimal. “I would be shocked if they [Tesla] didn’t have a view about where the world is going and are playing towards that,” he said. Despite the setback, Munster emphasized that Tesla remains at the forefront of the EV revolution and is well-positioned to weather the current challenges. “I think the two biggest forces in play here are the broader macro: EVs are more expensive than traditional cars, rates are high, and then separately, I think the excitement around EVs has slowed,” Munster commented. One key concern raised by Munster is the affordability of EVs compared to traditional cars, particularly amid rising interest rates and potential price declines in the used EV market. “The used market has shown some price declines… and I think that’s getting us to the numbers we’re having,” he noted. Despite the immediate market reaction, Munster remains optimistic about Tesla’s long-term prospects. He cites the company’s innovative approach and unwavering commitment to its mission. As Tesla grapples with the fallout from its missed targets, investors and industry observers will closely watch for signs of a rebound and assess the company’s ability to regain momentum in an increasingly competitive market. The road ahead may be uncertain, but one thing is clear—Tesla’s journey is far from over, and all stakeholders will scrutinize its next moves closely.

Hertz’s Electrification Gamble: A Cautionary Tale,2024-04-04T18:39:40+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/hertzs-electrification-gamble-a-cautionary-tale/,"In a bold move to transform a century-old car rental business for the modern era, a pair of finance veterans made a daring bet on electric vehicles (EVs). However, what seemed like a visionary strategy ultimately led to financial turmoil and a strategic U-turn. Bloomberg’s Erik Schatzker sheds light on the rise and fall of Hertz’s electrification plan. The genesis of this saga dates back to 2021 when Hertz, under new ownership, embarked on an ambitious electrification plan. The goal was to revolutionize the rental car industry by phasing out gas guzzlers and replacing them with Tesla’s sleek electric vehicles. The plan appeared promising at the time, representing a forward-thinking approach to sustainability and innovation. Schatzker reveals that his involvement began three years ago when the electrification plan was conceived. “It seemed like a great idea to them and me,” Schatzker admits. The allure of modernizing an age-old business model with cutting-edge technology was undeniable.  However, as Schatzker explains, what began as a promising venture soon encountered insurmountable challenges. The demand for EVs from rental and purchasing perspectives proved lackluster. “Some of it for sure is early EV demand from a rental standpoint; it just isn’t there yet,” Schatzker notes. Additionally, inexperienced EV drivers behind the wheel of Teslas led to a surge in accidents, exacerbating Hertz’s financial woes. Moreover, Elon Musk’s unexpected price cuts in 2023 further destabilized Hertz’s financial footing. The resultant depreciation costs damaged the company’s balance sheet, prompting a strategic reassessment. Hertz’s decision to offload thousands of Teslas and revert to gas-powered vehicles signifies a significant retreat from its electrification ambitions. With Stephen Scherr, the former CEO and CFO of Goldman Sachs, departing, Hertz is navigating a leadership transition. Gil West, a seasoned executive with extensive experience in the transportation sector, now assumes the helm. His appointment signals a concerted effort to steer Hertz through turbulent waters and execute a strategic turnaround. As Hertz embarks on this new chapter, the electrification debacle serves as a poignant reminder of the perils of premature innovation and the importance of prudent business decision-making. While the allure of groundbreaking initiatives may be enticing, navigating uncharted territory requires careful consideration and foresight. For Hertz, the electrification gamble is a cautionary tale, highlighting the inherent risks of disrupting traditional business models without a clear path to success.

Tesla is dragging Apple into its upcoming fatal Autopilot crash trial,2024-04-04T17:20:46+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121014/tesla-apple-huang-autopilot-wrongful-death-trial,"By  Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Tesla is going to court next week over the role its Autopilot system played in a fatal crash in 2018 — and it wants Apple to testify in its defense.  Tesla wants to prove that Apple engineer Wei “Walter” Huang was playing a video game on his phone at the time his Autopilot-enabled Model X smashed into a safety barrier along US Highway 101 in Mountain View, California, in 2018. And now, Huang’s family, which is suing Tesla for wrongful death, is claiming that Tesla is secretly working with Apple to aid in its defense.  In a pretrial motion filed this week, lawyers representing Huang’s family accused Apple of “engaging in a secret discovery ‘work around’ to help support Tesla in its defense of the pending case.”  Huang’s family accused Apple of “engaging in a secret discovery ‘work around’ to help support Tesla” In its initial investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board found that a video game — “a world-building strategy game with multiplayer capability” — was the frontmost app on Huang’s phone at the time of the crash. But investigators could not determine whether he was actively playing it when his Model X slammed into the concrete divider.  “The log data are not specific enough to ascertain whether the Tesla driver was holding the phone at the time of the crash,” NTSB said in its report.  However, historical cellphone logs from Huang’s phone found “a pattern of active game play” during morning commute hours in the days leading up to the crash and data transmission “consistent with online game activity” in the minutes leading up to the crash. Huang’s family claims he was letting games run passively on his phone to collect data.  The Huang family’s lawyers now say that Tesla, with the help of Apple, is trying to overturn this at the last minute by submitting a declaration from an Apple engineer, James Harding, that states that the company determined that Huang was actively playing the game at the time of the crash. Harding has worked at Apple for 18 years as a manager of “system debug tools and services,” according to his LinkedIn.  Historical cellphone logs from Huang’s phone found “a pattern of active game play” By submitting Harding’s testimony as a declaration rather than through a deposition, Tesla and Apple are trying to “circumvent the discovery process,” the lawyers representing  Huang’s family contend. They also slam the companies for submitting Harding’s declaration five months after the close of discovery, denying them the opportunity to question the Apple manager before the trial. Tesla plans on calling Harding as a witness.  The Huang family’s lawyers have subpoenaed Apple, seeking more information about Harding’s declaration. Last month, Apple filed an application to quash the subpoena, arguing the Huang lawyers were seeking “a su...",-2

Elon Musk announces Tesla Robotaxi reveal for Aug. 8,2024-04-05T23:50:26+00:00,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/04/05/tesla-robotaxi-announcement-elon-musk/3631712357237/,"


April 5 (UPI) -- Elon Musk on Friday announced Tesla will unveil its Robotaxi later this summer.
Musk, in a cryptic post to X, set Aug. 8 as the reveal date for the long-awaited Robotaxi, a consumer revenue-generating autonomous vehicle built on Tesla's next-generation vehicle platform.

Market shares for Tesla jumped after he shared the post, rising 4% just before markets closed.
Musk has long speculated the possibility of Tesla owners being able to earn revenue from their self-driving vehicles by sending them to pick up and drop off passengers.

""You will also be able to add your car to the Tesla shared fleet just by tapping a button on the Tesla phone app and have it generate income for you while you're at work or on vacation, significantly offsetting and at times potentially exceeding the monthly loan or lease cost,"" Musk wrote in his ""master plan"" in 2016.
In 2019, Musk promised a future with over a million Tesla cars on the road with ""full self-driving hardware"" was less than a year away.
Despite his grand vision, years have gone by without Tesla producing cars that can drive on their own.

Ostensibly Full Self-Driving capability comes standard with every new Tesla. The company's website, however, notes this feature requires active driver supervision and does not make the vehicle fully autonomous.
Musk, regardless, has said the system will one day make Teslas highly valuable.
""You can think of every car we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as something that in the future may be worth five times what it is today,"" he said in the company's Q3 earnings call last year.
Critics said Musk's predictions are far off. Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology for Consumer Reports, recently tested the self-driving feature and described it as being driven by a novice teenager.
""You're not likely to tune out and become complacent or over-reliant on it,"" she said. ""In fact, I would say you're potentially more alert.""
Tesla last year issued a recall for 2 million vehicles after a defect was reported in the autopilot technology. The U.S. government is investigating the company's claims around self-driving technology.
Musk's company is not the only one to come under fire for overselling autonomous driving. Cruise, a GM subsidiary, paused testing after one of its vehicles hit and dragged a pedestrian. The Department of Justice is investigating the company over the incident.

How Might Tesla Rollout?  Tesla has about 100,000 cars that were returned from multi-year leases. They can put the software on all of those cars. Tesla can also reduce used car sales. Tesla should just get the robotaxi network stood up with Tesla owners.  Tesla can adjust how much they get from robotaxi by increasing FSD subscriptions and profit sharing with OEM partners.

 Elon Musk revealed Friday that Tesla will pull back the curtain on a robotaxi this summer, news that comes as adoption of self-driving vehicles hits speed bumps over safety concerns. The billionaire boss of the electric car maker did not provide details, saying only in his post on X that the ""Tesla Robotaxi unveil"" will come on August 8. Tesla shares rose more than three percent in after-market trades following the post, after finishing the day down. Musk has long boasted of work Tesla is doing on its systems for electric cars to drive themselves. Tesla models with FSD (Full Self-Driving) ""will be superhuman to such a degree that it will seem strange in the future that humans drove cars, even while exhausted and drunk!"" he said in a post on X in March. Musk has also said that owners of Tesla vehicles with FSD will be able to have their cars serve as robotaxis, rather than remain idly parked. Despite its potential, rollout of self-driving vehicles in the United States has been tentative and rocky so far as both regulators and the public voice safety concerns. San Francisco has been a testing ground for the technology. Robotaxis from Google's Waymo in the city have been targeted by vandals opposed to autonomous vehicles, while GM-owned Cruise indefinitely suspended its robotaxi service at the end of October after several accidents sparked a crackdown by California regulators. Tesla's ""autopilot"" feature has also come under scrutiny, facing accusations the marketing of the feature oversold its actual capabilities. Tesla's robotaxi reveal came on the heels of a Reuters report that the company had abandoned Musk's long-touted plan to manufacture an electric car model selling close to $25,000 to drive adoption in the mass market. Musk fired off a post denying the report. Tesla this week reported sharply lower first-quarter auto sales amid an underwhelming demand outlook for electric vehicles, while legacy players including Toyota rode improved U.S. inventories to higher sales. Musk's auto giant reported global deliveries fell 8.5 percent in the quarter, reflecting in part a weak sales market in China, where it faces heavy competition from local electric vehicle makers.

Patil's cautious stance came to light on Friday following a comment made by Aarin Capital chairman TV Mohandas Pai. Pai had remarked on the ongoing talks between the Telangana government and Tesla regarding the establishment of an electric car plant. Expressing his enthusiasm for Karnataka's potential as an investment destination, Pai questioned whether the Karnataka government (GoK) was actively courting Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk. His remarks aimed to encourage the Congress-led administration to pursue Tesla's interest in setting up operations in Karnataka. These comments were preceded by statements from Telangana's Industries Minister Duddila Sridhar Babu, who indicated his government's efforts to attract Tesla to their state. In response to Pai's comments, Minister Patil addressed the matter on a social media platform, X. He expressed caution about publicly discussing sensitive matters involving multinational corporations like Foxconn and Tesla. Patil highlighted the importance of handling such negotiations with discretion, emphasising that the intricacies of government actions or decisions regarding these companies should not be openly debated. Stressing the need for maturity in handling such affairs, Patil indicated that neither he nor his department would comment further on the subject.

Tesla FSD Licensing and Pricing for Maximum Adoption,2024-04-07T19:30:10+00:00,https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2024/04/tesla-fsd-licensing-and-pricing-for-maximum-adoption.html,"Home » Artificial intelligence » Tesla FSD Licensing and Pricing for Maximum Adoption Tesla FSD pricing and licensing strategies for maximum adoption. 1.

– Assuming a 10% increase in attach rate from the free trial, with a mix of $199 monthly subs and one-time $12k purchases
– The implied EPS uplift is $0.30/share, equating to 10% of the consensus FY24 earnings per share of $3. New vehicles:
– Assuming 2M unit sales and US FSD attach rate increase to 25%
– The implied EPS uplift is $0.20/share, or 6% of the FY24 EPS. Attach rate >>> pricing/ near-term profits: For $TSLA, prioritizing the adoption rate over pricing is essential. Unlike most other technologies (ChatGPT included), FSD has no current or foreseeable competition. It has a ton of pricing power in the mid to long-term, but customers need to be locked in. Without discounts (on the above math), US will have 0.8M FSD subscribers (out of 3M+ units) by the end of this year. At an assumed 50% discount (with the same bottom-line impact), FSD subscribers could hit 1.5M. Have not seen this pace of development at $TSLA for a very long time… Offering FSD free trial across all fleets (even better if there can be more flexible pricing) could greatly unlock value.

Sign up here — just click TechCrunch Mobility — to receive the newsletter every weekend in your inbox. Subscribe for free. Automakers reported auto sales for Q1 and, welp, turns out that pricing sure does matter if you want to sell EVs. Who would have thought? A recent survey by Edmunds comes to a similar conclusion (at least for American buyers), finding a big gap between what consumers want and what is actually available on the market. Here’s the crux. According to the Edmunds survey, 47% say they are seeking an EV purchase below $40,000, and 22% are interested in EVs priced below the $30,000 threshold. Today, there are no new EVs priced below $30,000 and only four below the $40,000 mark. The average price of an EV in 2023 was $61,702, while all other vehicles stood at $47,450. This mismatch of realities is squeezing automakers as they try to move inventory by slashing prices. This downward pressure has forced automakers like Ford to delay future EV launches and put more resources toward hybrids. Even Tesla, a bellwether in the EV world, fell well below analysts’ expectations with deliveries down 20% from Q4 2023. Meanwhile, EV upstart Rivian posted tepid results. What’s the answer? Well, over at Tesla, it seems the solution is twofold: slash prices again and try to capture revenue through sales of its Full Self-Driving software that costs $12,000 and is currently being offered in a free one-month trial to all customers. OK, folks, let’s jump into the rest of the news!  Founders, investors, engineers, policy wonks and others tell us things. And we’re here to pass along the verifiable information that those little birds have shared with us. This week, a little bird tipped us on the closure of Ghost Autonomy, which had raised upward of $220 million and recently partnered with OpenAI. A couple of calls, emails and a fresh posting on the company’s website confirmed the tip. About 100 people were affected. As I noted in my article, Ghost has pivoted a few times since it was founded in 2017. When I asked founder and CEO John Hayes what happened, he said the company had completed a highway driving product and was moving in urban environments through what he described as “last-mile delivery.” “Ultimately, the years required to bring the product to market could not be financed,” he wrote to me in an email.

Tesla settles lawsuit over man's death in a crash involving its semi-autonomous driving software,2024-04-08T23:27:15+00:00,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/california/story/2024-04-08/tesla-settles-lawsuit-over-mans-death-in-a-crash-involving-its-semi-autonomous-driving-software,,No rating found
Tesla is settling with the family of the Apple engineer who died in an Autopilot crash,2024-04-08T23:25:34+00:00,https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24124744/tesla-autopilot-lawsuit-settlement-huang-death,"By  Sean Hollister, a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget. This week, Tesla was scheduled to appear in court to defend its Autopilot system against a claim of wrongful death — but it looks like the company will pay the family of Apple engineer Wei “Walter” Huang instead.  Court documents show that Tesla is trying to seal the amount of a potential settlement payment to the Huang family. While it’s not clear how much the company might be offering or what other terms the settlement includes, lawyers for Tesla state that both parties have already agreed to the settlement and want it to be confidential.  You can read that document below; The Washington Post and Bloomberg reported the news earlier. Lawyers for the Huang family didn’t immediately respond to our email. The settlement has not yet been approved by a judge. Court documents suggest that there’ll be a follow-up hearing this Thursday, April 11th to discuss the settlement further — after the California Department of Transportation, which is also a defendant in the case, gets a chance to object to the settlement.  Huang’s Tesla Model X was confirmed to be using Autopilot when it smashed into a safety barrier in Mountain View, California in March 2018. He died following the crash. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that both Autopilot and distracted driving were factors leading to the crash.  Tesla was planning to argue that Huang was playing a game on his phone at the time — he had a pattern of playing games during commute hours, and investigators found a game was the frontmost app on his phone at the time, but couldn’t determine if he was actually playing it when the vehicle crashed. Tesla wanted to drag Apple into the trial, subpoenaing the company for proof that Apple knew he was playing the game, and Apple has been trying to quash that subpoena.

Tesla’s Revamped Model 3 Sparks Excitement in Austin,2024-04-09T22:59:58+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/teslas-revamped-model-3-sparks-excitement-in-austin/,"In the heart of Austin, Texas, where the spirit of innovation and adventure thrives, a crowd gathered outside the local Tesla shop, eager to witness the unveiling of the highly anticipated revamped Model 3. Among the crowd of enthusiasts and curious onlookers was Farzad, a prominent YouTuber whose passion for all things Tesla has earned him a dedicated following. “Hey, guys, it’s Farzad here, and I am beyond thrilled to be here today to unveil the refreshed Model 3,” Farzad exclaimed, his trademark enthusiasm lighting up the dreary day. “I’ve been following the updates, and let me tell you, I’ve been counting down the days for this moment!” As Farzad made his way through the crowd, he couldn’t help but marvel at the sight before him. “Just look at this lineup of Model 3s,” he exclaimed, gesturing to the row of sleek sedans gleaming under the overcast sky. “It’s like a Tesla lover’s dream come true!”  Approaching the newest addition to the lineup, Farzad’s excitement only grew. “I mean, would you look at this beauty?” he gushed, running a hand over the smooth lines of the refreshed Model 3. “The design is simply stunning, and those headlights? Pure perfection!” But Farzad’s admiration was not limited to the exterior aesthetics. Stepping inside the cabin, he was met with a wave of luxury and innovation that left him speechless. “Guys, you have to see this interior,” Farzad exclaimed, his eyes widening in amazement. “It’s like stepping into the future!” As Farzad settled into the driver’s seat and took hold of the steering wheel, he couldn’t contain his excitement. “Alright, let’s take this baby for a spin!” he declared, his grin stretching from ear to ear. And what a spin it was! As Farzad navigated the streets of Austin, he couldn’t help but be blown away by the performance and handling of the refreshed Model 3. “The acceleration is mind-blowing, and the handling is as smooth as butter,” he exclaimed, his words punctuated by the roar of the electric motor. However, according to Farzad, perhaps the most impressive aspect of the refreshed Model 3 is its unbeatable value proposition. “Starting at just $38,000, this car offers performance, luxury, and innovation that rivals vehicles twice its price,” he marveled, his excitement palpable. Of course, no vehicle is without quirks, and Farzad quickly pointed out a few minor gripes. “The clicky buttons on the turn signals could use some refinement,” he noted, his keen eye for detail ever-present. “But hey, when you’re driving this incredible car, it’s easy to overlook the small stuff.” As Farzad reluctantly handed back the keys and bid farewell to the Tesla shop, his excitement showed no signs of waning. “Guys, mark my words, the refreshed Model 3 is a game-changer,” he declared, his voice ringing with conviction. “Tesla has once again raised the bar for automotive excellence, and I, for one, couldn’t be more thrilled about it!” So, if you’re in the market for a vehicle that combines performance, luxury, a...",3

Tesla’s Struggles Highlight Challenges Amidst Growing Competition and Shifting Demand,2024-04-09T20:17:06+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/teslas-struggles-highlight-challenges-amidst-growing-competition-and-shifting-demand/,"In a tumultuous year for Tesla, the electric vehicle (EV) titan grapples with many challenges, including intensified competition and waning demand. As shares tumble by approximately 30% in 2024 and first-quarter deliveries disappoint, investors are left questioning the company’s resilience and long-term viability in an increasingly crowded market. Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, faces mounting pressure to navigate the company through choppy waters, with analysts and investors scrutinizing every move amidst uncertainty about the EV landscape’s future. To shed light on Tesla’s current predicament, we turn to Ed Carson, news editor at Investors Business Daily (IBD), for insights into the factors driving Tesla’s recent downturn. According to Carson, Tesla’s lackluster performance in the first quarter can be attributed to short-term disruptions and broader market trends. While seasonal weaknesses in China and production challenges at Tesla’s Fremont plant have contributed to the decline, Carson emphasizes deeper-rooted issues, such as softening demand for EVs and an aging product lineup.  Despite the dismal delivery figures, some industry insiders, like Tesla bull Dan Ives, maintain optimism about the company’s long-term prospects. Ives sees the first-quarter results as a temporary setback and remains bullish on Tesla’s potential for growth, particularly in emerging technologies like full self-driving (FSD) and artificial intelligence (AI). However, Carson cautions that Tesla’s path to profitability hinges on the successful execution of these ambitious initiatives, which have encountered numerous delays and setbacks in the past. One of Tesla’s flagship projects, FSD, has long been hailed as a transformative breakthrough for the company. Yet, progress has been slower than anticipated, with Musk’s annual promises of achieving full autonomy failing to materialize thus far. Carson acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the timeline for FSD, citing regulatory hurdles and technological challenges as potential roadblocks. Amidst speculation about Tesla’s future direction, rumors of plans for a smaller electric vehicle (EV) have emerged. However, details remain scarce, leaving investors to ponder the potential implications for Tesla’s growth trajectory. With competition intensifying and margins under pressure, the success of any new product launches will be critical for Tesla’s long-term success. As Tesla grapples with these challenges, investors face a stark disconnect between bullish expectations and bearish realities. While some remain steadfast in their belief in Tesla’s innovative potential, others are increasingly skeptical of its ability to deliver on its lofty promises. With the stock trading at lofty valuations despite declining earnings and uncertain growth prospects, the debate rages on about whether Tesla is a visionary leader or a risky bet in an increasingly competitive market. As Tesla prepares to announce its first-quarter earnings, all eyes will be...",-3

Ong, a seasoned entrepreneur with a wealth of experience in the healthcare and technology sectors, underscored the significance of Tesla’s Mega Pack initiative in addressing the pressing need for efficient energy storage solutions. Drawing parallels between Tesla’s disruptive innovations and their potential impact on the energy landscape, Ong highlighted the pivotal role of Mega Pack factories in accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources. “As we witness the accelerating adoption of renewable energy worldwide, the demand for scalable and cost-effective energy storage solutions has never been greater,” Ong remarked. “Tesla’s Mega Pack factories are poised to revolutionize the energy sector, offering a game-changing solution to traditional power grids’ challenges.” Nelson, renowned for his insightful commentary on emerging technologies, provided valuable insights into the strategic implications of Tesla’s Mega Pack initiative. Nelson emphasized the transformative potential of Tesla’s foray into the energy storage market, leveraging his expertise in EV technology and AI. “Tesla’s expansion into the Mega Pack market signifies a paradigm shift in how we think about energy storage,” Nelson stated. “By combining their expertise in battery technology with their proven track record in manufacturing, Tesla is poised to lead the charge towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future.”  The discussion explored the broader implications of Tesla’s Mega Pack initiative, touching upon its potential to reshape energy markets and drive economic growth. Herbert emphasized the importance of regionalized supply chains and fair markets in facilitating the transition to clean, efficient, and resilient energy grids. “Tesla’s Mega Pack initiative represents a significant step forward in our efforts to combat climate change and promote sustainable development,” Herbert remarked. “By fostering collaboration and innovation, Tesla is paving the way for a more equitable and prosperous future.” Nelson echoed Herbert’s sentiments, highlighting the strategic importance of Tesla’s Mega Pack initiative in driving innovation and investment in renewable energy infrastructure. “Tesla’s commitment to sustainability and innovation is evident in their Mega Pack initiative,” Nelson stated. “By investing in advanced energy storage solutions, Tesla is not only addressing the immediate challenges facing the energy sector but also laying the foundation for a more sustainable and prosperous future.” As the discussion drew to a close, Ong and Nelson expressed optimism about the future of renewable energy and Tesla’s role in shaping the...",3
Tesla risks losing its lead without an inexpensive EV,2024-04-09T19:35:54+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/09/tesla-musk-25k-ev-decision/,"Elon Musk’s decision to green-light a robotaxi over an affordable EV might cost the company its lead. Last week, Musk reportedly canned the effort in favor of a robotaxi, the sort of pie-in-the-sky project that defined his first decade at the helm. There’s an argument to be made that the company is where it is today by betting big, then delivering on enough of its promises to impress shareholders and generate significant positive cashflow. Problem is, in the early days, there was both everything and nothing to lose. The whole company could have gone under, but there was also less on the line. Today, Tesla is no longer the plucky upstart. It brought in nearly $100 billion in revenue last year and earned net profits of $15 billion, the sort that would have other automakers rewarding shareholders with richer dividends. It’s a global manufacturer that cranks out hundreds of thousands of cars every quarter, the type of operation where success is measured in continuous improvement in productivity and process indicators. Tesla was reportedly on the cusp of building a $25,000 EV. In January, Musk confirmed that the company would begin construction of a next-generation vehicle at its Texas plant in the second half of 2025. Suppliers had been asked to bid on parts contracts, Reuters reported, with weekly production volume starting at 10,000 vehicles per week. Given flagging sales of the company’s existing product line, it would have been a welcome shot in the arm. An inexpensive EV would have significantly increased Tesla’s total addressable market by dramatically undercutting the average sales price in the U.S., which is currently at around $47,000. It also would have given the company a product to hold its ground against a predicted onslaught of inexpensive Chinese EVs. But it also would have meant creating a production line from scratch, something the company last did at scale with the Model 3. By all accounts, that wasn’t a fun experience. Building a robotaxi, though. Now, that sounds like fun. Musk has long been enamored with the concept. Four years ago, he said that such a car would be able to earn its owner up to $30,000 per year as it ferried paying passengers to and fro. It would be so popular, Musk reportedly told biographer Walter Isaacson, that “there is no amount that we could possibly build that will be enough.” Problem is, Tesla has been trying to master autonomous hardware and software for a while now, and it doesn’t appear anywhere close to delivering a vehicle capable of Level 5 driving, which would require zero human input. Despite years of work, Autopilot remains a Level 2 system, which means it requires human attention at all times. The same is true for Full Self-Driving. (Indeed, the company recently started using the term “supervised” when referring to the software suite.) And while artificial intelligence has been advancing rapidly of late, is it moving quickly enough to provide Tesla with a blockbuster product in the next few years...",-2
Robotaxi regulators say Tesla hasn’t contacted them about plans teased by Musk,2024-04-11T23:45:44+00:00,https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456," Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time SAN FRANCISCO — Two California agencies that regulate robotaxis said they haven’t heard from Tesla about its plans for the cars, even though Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced last week that he’ll reveal a new robotaxi product in August.  The California Department of Motor Vehicles and the California Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC, said in separate statements to NBC News that Tesla hadn’t applied for the two permits it would need to operate a driverless car service in the country’s most populous state.  Two other states that regulate robotaxis, Arizona and Nevada, also said they had not heard from Tesla about its plans.  The lack of permits — or any attempt to acquire them — raises questions about how quickly Tesla would be able to get a robotaxi service up and running.  “Tesla’s a long way away from getting that approval,” said Brad Templeton, a consultant in the autonomous vehicle industry.  Representatives for Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.  California, which has been ground zero for the rollout of robotaxis, requires aspiring robotaxi services to obtain at least two permits. The DMV handles permits to deploy autonomous equipment on the road, and Tesla currently has the lowest-level permit, allowing it to test autonomous vehicles with human drivers present. Only three companies have the highest-level permit, which allows them to deploy autonomous vehicles without human drivers.  “Tesla has not applied for a deployment permit with the DMV,” the department said in a statement in response to questions.  If Tesla were to deploy robotaxis that are autonomous, it added, “the DMV will take steps to make certain that Tesla operates under the appropriate autonomous vehicle permits.”  The CPUC handles permits to operate robotaxis as businesses, including for tech startup Waymo’s services in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Tesla has no CPUC permit and hasn’t applied, the commission said.  “If Tesla wanted to provide a robotaxi service they’d need to follow the same rules as other such companies (i.e., DMV approval for driverless testing/deployment before seeking a CPUC permit). The CPUC has not been contacted for such a permit,” the commission said in a statement in response to questions.  Waymo, a spinoff of Google, needed eight months to get its initial CPUC permit to operate a robotaxi business that could charge fares, as opposed to offering free test rides only. It applied in December 2022 and won approval in August.  Templeton said it’s possible Tesla’s timeline for approval could be shorter than eight months — or longer.  “It could also be that they think Tesla is premature and they never approve it,” he said. Templeton is a former member of Google’s self-driving car team, which became Waymo, but he left a decade ago and said he no longer has ties to the company.  Tesla has approached the challenge of self-driving te...",-2
Coachella prepares to launch new Tesla rideshare program for community members,2024-04-11T17:37:14+00:00,https://kesq.com/news/2024/04/11/coachella-prepares-to-launch-new-tesla-rideshare-program-for-community-members/,"The city of Coachella is getting closer to launching a new community rideshare service that is focused on providing green rides to anyone who needs it.  Last July, the Coachella City Council approved an agreement with Latino Equity Advocacy Policy Institute (LEAP). Councilmembers also authorized the purchase of 15 Model Y Teslas for the program.  ""We're excited about this program coming to fruition,"" said Mayor Steven Hernandez. He added, ""we applied, about 4 years ago, to Cap-and-Trade dollars and part of that money was to introduce a rideshare program.""  The City currently has a partial fleet. While all of the vehicles are delivered to the city's corporate yard, the City will be working with its non-profit partner to implement the new rideshare services in the next few months. ""Full funding from the Transformative Climate Community's grant is supposed to hit in the fall so we're preparing for that,"" according to Risseth Lora, Public Information Officer for the city of Coachella.  Each Model Y Tesla can seat up to 7 passengers and anyone interested in booking a ride, once the program is operational, will be able to do so by calling a number. The goal is to eventually create an app to book rides, similar to the way Uber or Lyft operate.  ""It's a  program thats worked effectively in the San Joaquin Valley and the Coachella Valley is very similar in being geographically isolated as it is. We're a majority Latino,"" according to Rey Leon, Executive Director and Founder of the Latino Equity Advocacy Policy (LEAP) Institute.  Leon has launched a similar rideshare service in Fresno County called The Green Raiteros. Once services are operational, the city of Coachella will be locked into a 5 year program.

Tesla is Creating Level 4 Self Driving Cars Before Our Eyes,2024-04-11T15:34:15+00:00,https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2024/04/tesla-is-creating-level-4-self-driving-cars-before-our-eyes.html,"Home » Artificial intelligence » Tesla is Creating Level 4 Self Driving Cars Before Our Eyes Tesla FSD is rapidly improving and seems to be creating level 4 self driving before our eyes. It is something that is difficult for many to believe and accept. AI systems have a history of not working for a long time and then having improvement that seems sudden to human observers. Once an AI gets into the pretty good relative to humans then they tend to very rapidly get to as good or better than the best human. They are now releasing FSD 12.3.4 to all Tesla buyers in the North America. It is available to almost 2 million new drivers. FSD 12.4 should be out this month (April) and it is reported to be substantially better. FSD 12.3.4 should be able to handle reverse. There are only a few features that need to be added to get to a feature complete system. There were reports two weeks ago from some Tesla engineers who believed that FSD would reach robotaxi level by July 2024. Tesla will be revealing its robotaxi vehicle on August 8, 2024. We will learn on that day what Tesla is planning and possible timelines.  The initial review for Tesla FSD 12.3.4 are good.

I am not convinced that Tesla will be the first company to solve autonomous driving. Musk has a consistent tendency to overpromise and underdeliver.
However, even under the assumption that they are the first to truly solve autopilot, in my opinion, Tesla will be doomed, and the issue is twofold, from manufacturer’s side and from the human side
Solving self-driving means solving legal/regulatory issues about accident liabilities that will misalign the interest of the manufacturer and the car owners. And the manufacturer will likely have to put them in black and white on their user license/ownership contracts:
-is it ok for your car to choose a trajectory that will kill you but will save a child who jumped in front of the car? What about if it is an elderly man who stumbled?
-On the other hand, is it ok to choose to save the car occupant no matter the collateral cost, even though this will increase the insurance costs because you might end up killing and maiming more people?

"Elon Musk to announce affordable Starlink internet service during India visit, will it impact country's digital future? Know",2024-04-11T15:16:40+00:00,https://www.zeebiz.com/trending/news-tesla-ceo-elon-musk-to-meet-pm-modi-to-announce-investment-plans-and-cheap-unlimited-high-speed-data-starlink-internet-service-during-india-visit-to-india-how-will-it-impact-indian-digital-economy-283853,"Is Elon Musk, the visionary behind SpaceX and Tesla, poised to introduce Starlink, an affordable satellite-based internet service, to India during his upcoming visit? Let's explore the potential impact of this technological breakthrough. After numerous setbacks, Starlink is on the verge of launching its satellite broadband services in India, a nation with nearly 920 million broadband subscribers. Regulatory hurdles have been cleared, and with the recent passage of The Telecommunications Bill 2023, spectrum allocation for satellite-based services has been streamlined, favoring companies like Starlink. Experts suggest that Starlink's potential arrival could fuel India's digital economy, providing increased digital access to citizens across the country. This could lead to a surge in entrepreneurship, improved access to education and healthcare, and greater participation in the digital workforce. Starlink offers unlimited high-speed data with download speeds reaching up to 220 Mbps. While the pricing for Starlink services in India is yet to be disclosed, in the US, basic plans start at $120 per month for rural households. During his visit, Musk is expected to meet with Prime Minister Modi and may unveil Tesla's plans for India, including the potential establishment of a manufacturing plant requiring a significant investment. While the final itinerary for Musk's trip remains unconfirmed, the anticipation surrounding Starlink's potential entry into India and Tesla's expansion plans highlights the country's growing significance in the global technology landscape.
