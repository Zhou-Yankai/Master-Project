SessionGuardian Mobile delivers identity assurance and data protection for iOS mobile devices,2024-01-05T12:00:19+00:00,https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/01/05/sessionguardian-mobile-software/,"In a bold leap towards fortifying against cyber threats, SessionGuardian unveiled its SessionGuardian Mobile software.  This solution delivers relentless identity assurance and data protection for iOS mobile devices. This offering seamlessly complements the existing SessionGuardian VDI and SessionGuardian Web. In an increasingly remote-friendly, bring-your-own-device-friendly employment environment, the need to secure each session has never been greater. According to IBMâ€˜s reports on data breaches, 51% of organizations plan to increase security investments as a result of a breach. The global average cost of a single breach, as per the same report, was a staggering $4.45 million. For most enterprise organizations with dispersed, remote, or on-the-go teams, the cost of deploying SessionGuardian Mobile is a small investment when compared to the costs of a data breach and its multi-year ramifications. By deploying SessionGuardian Mobile, organizations can elevate their defense mechanisms to unprecedented heights. SessionGuardianâ€™s elegant design allows mobile users to effortlessly utilize the strictest security controls. SessionGuardian Mobileâ€™s features include: Identity assurance through: Data protection by: End-user privacy protection: Extended security visibility with: Device posture compliance by: George Marks, CEO of SessionGuardian, expressed his excitement about the launch, stating, â€œSessionGuardian Mobile shows our unyielding commitment to providing comprehensive identity assurance and data protection solutions.

"Hybrid arrangements tripled since 2022, trend far from over, says Capterra",2024-01-04T19:17:13+00:00,https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/hybrid-arrangements-tripled-since-2022-trend-far-from-over-says-capterra/555789,"VideosÂ PodcastsBlogsSlideshows Nearly 70 per cent of Canadian hybrid workers go to the office two to three times a week, a new Capterra report that surveyed 1,021 part- and full-time employees working at least some days from the office has found. The increased prevalence of hybrid work comes as companies like IBM, Amazon, Disney, Google, and even remote work poster child Zoom have vehemently pushed return to office (RTO) mandates. Another report from Resume Builder also revealed that 91 per cent of companies will require employees to go to the office on a monthly basis, and 75 per cent will require employees to work from the office weekly.

HR Predictions 2024: Generative AI, employee experience, remote work and more


 Companies are even taking it a step further, with 95 per cent saying that employees will suffer consequences if they donâ€™t comply. Their employment, bonuses, and salaries will likely be at risk, Resume Builder says. Reportedly, 80 per cent of companies will also track office attendance in 2024. The Capterra report says that the RTO trend after COVID-19 restrictions temporarily closed some workplaces was perhaps influenced by employers who donâ€™t want their investments in physical office space to go to waste. But many organizations requiring employees to come to the office at least sometimes also tout increased productivity, valuable social connections, and higher trust at work, Capterra acknowledged. However, some businesses perceive such rigid RTO policies to clamp down on things like absenteeism can be perceived as disregarding employeesâ€?well being. Several companies have, in fact, seen employees quit en masse following stringent in-office mandates. In Canada, only 23 per cent of surveyed employees in Canada report having company-wide mandatory in-office days. The same number of surveyed employees said their department also enforces mandatory in-office days. But employees should be incentivized back to the office, Capterra says. Nearly a third of employees who go to the office less than five times a week (32 per cent) said perks like free snacks and coffee would motivate them to come in more often. â€œFree food might seem like an oversimplified tactic for boosting office attendance, but it could be a deciding factor for many workers,â€?said Tessa Anaya, analyst at Capterra, in an interview with ITWC. She added, â€œFactors such as social events, a better office location, or even a more diverse and inclusive work environment were selected by far fewer employee respondents, which speaks to the motivational power of a good cup of coffee.â€?The Resume Builder report also noted that a whopping 91 per cent of companies say they will provide incentives to employees for going into the office. These incentives include happy hours (52 per cent), catered meals (46 per cent), and upgraded office space (41 per cent). But fewer employers will offer bigger incentives such as raises (40 per cent) and child care benefits (37 per cent). Other ...",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 The Kerala government has initiated steps to make Kochi the hub for artificial intelligence technology in the country. State Industry Minister, P. Rajeeve, and Principal Secretary Suman Billa, have held discussions with IBM India and an in-principle agreement has been reached to start the companyâ€™s hub in Kochi.  As part of the initiative, the State government will conduct a Global Artificial Intelligence Summit in Kochi by the middle of this year, the Minister said after discussions with IBM India Senior Vice-President (Products), Dinesh Nirmal. Launch of IBMâ€™s AI hub would result in an influx of top technology professionals to Kochi and could also lead to reverse migration, the minister said. Besides adding to IBMâ€™s employee strength, the proposed AI hub could prompt other industry players to follow suit. This would augment the prospects of Infopark, which is entering its second stage of expansion, he said, adding that the proposed hub would work on the basis of generative AI, beyond just generic AI.  Suman Billa said the summit would be conducted in association with the Industry Department. The IT Parks, Kerala Startup Mission, Digital University and APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University would collaborate in hosting the summit. Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation will make presentations on the preparations to make Kochi the countryâ€™s principal AI hub.

Multibagger stock: Sonata Software jumps over 160% in a year; is there more steam left?,2024-01-16T07:36:05+00:00,https://www.zeebiz.com/markets/stocks/news-sonata-software-share-price-nse-bse-price-target-idbi-capital-multi-bagger-stock-272325,"Brokerage firm IDBI Capital is bullish on software and consulting company Sonata Software on the back of strong financial performance over the past few quarters under the leadership of new chief executive officer (CEO), Samir Dhir. It sees over 19 per cent more upside in the stock, despite the shares giving 163 per cent returns in a year. As per the brokerage, Sonata Software's alliances with technology leaders like Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM; and involvement in several early adoption partnerships provide the company with an early-mover advantage on newer technology and releases. Not just that, as per the brokerage, the company has also outperformed its peers in terms of revenues by 70 to 200 basis points (bps) on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis and has better earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margins than peers that are 200â€?00 basis points higher. IDBI Capital expects the outperformance to continue in the medium term. Additionally, the brokerage believes that Sonataâ€™s focus on investing in sales and marketing, account mining, hunting, and a strong platformation framework will be key long-term growth drivers, which may lead to the company aspiring to double its international service revenues by FY27E from FY23. ""We believe the company could achieve the same by FY26E (implying a service revenue CAGR of 27 per cent over FY23-FY26E). Considering this, we expect overall revenue (including domestic sales) and profit after tax (PAT) to grow at a CAGR of 23 per cent and 24 per cent over FY23â€“FY26E,"" IDBI Capital's report read. The brokerage also expects large deals to drive robust growth. While touching on the valuations, the brokerage expects the growth to be better than the average of its peers, which should result in the stock commanding premium valuations in the medium to long term.

	This week, the National Retail Federationâ€™s â€œBig Showâ€?is gathering tens of thousands of retailers and brands across various channels and categories at the Jacob Javits Center in New York to network, learn and hear from industry leaders. 
	The real buzz was on the NRF Expo Hall floor, where several thousand tech companies, solution providers and other vendors are touting their wares. This year, the stars of the show are rapidly evolving innovations, including generative AI (also known as â€œGenAIâ€?, cloud-based solutions and integrated and unified commerce platforms. 
	But whatâ€™s driving the need for all this innovation?

	Regarding generative AI, IBM cited a recent IBM Institute for Business Value study that said the â€œretail landscape is undergoing a transformation, propelled by changes in consumer preferences and advancements in new technologies.â€?

	








 
	The reportâ€™s authors said todayâ€™s consumers are discerning and â€œexpect a tailored shopping journey, complete with the convenience of product choices, detailed information, diverse payment methods and a seamless integration of in-store and online experiences that cater to their individual preferences.â€?
 
	â€œGenerative AI can help address these expectations, creating retail environments as intuitive and unified as they are finely tuned to individual needs,â€?IBM said, adding that AI-driven solutions â€œare at the heart of IBMâ€™s offerings, focus and solutions at NRFâ€?4.â€?
	Meanwhile, Salesforce rolled out one of its biggest suites of solutions ever. Powered by the companyâ€™s Einstein 1 Platform, the innovations â€œaim to transform every shopping experience.â€?Salesforce said with generative AI built into its Commerce Cloud and Marketing Cloud, â€œretail merchandisers and marketers can tap into generative tools with a real-time understanding of customer behavior and preferences to optimize every customer interaction â€?increasing loyalty, driving revenue and boosting employee productivity.â€?
	While that sounds like a monumental task, the Einstein 1 Platform seamlessly integrates shopper and retail data â€?and does it while ensuring security. 
	To address the â€œwhy does all this matter?â€?question, Salesforce, using its own surveys, said 83 percent of global retailers have seen operational efficiency improvements with AI. â€œAnd 63 percent of marketers say that trusted customer data is important to implementing generative AI in their businesses,â€?Salesforce said. â€œR...",3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This involves embedding IBM's watsonx enterprise-ready AI and data platform and AI assistants, into SAP solutions to create new generative and traditional AI solutions focused on addressing the complexities of the direct store delivery business process and product portfolio management. ""Global and regional consumer industry organizations must manage various commerce applications and need advanced insights to provide proactive recommendations that help improve operations and meet customer expectations,"" says Luq Niazi, global managing partner, Industries and Global Consumer Industry at IBM Consulting. ""With SAP, we are looking to build on the long-standing work of incorporating AI into SAP solutions that can help enterprise clients achieve further business value."" Plans include feeding external data such as weather, traffic and local events into the SAP Direct Distribution solution and apply AI to help CPG companies identify optimal store delivery routes with the aim of helping to reduce costs and their carbon footprints. Real-time updates could provide drivers with information to make on-the-fly changes based on local conditions. At an individual store level the goal is for the solutions to be able to make specific product recommendations and include preliminary planning -- based on prior sales patterns, anticipated demand and current product mix -- so enough products are added to the assortment with the goal of maximizing sales and minimizing waste. It will also automate order settlement in order to deliver operational efficiencies. IBM Consulting plans to build these solutions on the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) and will integrate watsonx through APIs. Warehouse planners, frontline delivery associates and client representatives can have an enriched user experience by using watsonx Assistant to create chatbots using IBMâ€™s conversational search capabilities. ""At SAP, we look forward to collaborating with IBM on this important initiative to help consumer goods companies transform their operations and improve their bottom line,â€?says EJ Kenney, senior vice president Consumer Products Industry and Life Sciences Business Unit at SAP. â€œWe understand the complexities that come with managing direct store delivery and by leveraging the power of AI we aim to help our customers better manage their last mile distribution more effectively, minimize waste, improve customer satisfaction and achieve business value in todayâ€™s fast-paced consumer industry.""

The class of room temperature and room pressure superconductors is real.
He and other researchers have formed a corporation and the success of the company and its patents is the priority.
IBM is the first company to start discussions. Nextbigfuture believes there are other companies.
Sukbae Lee believes China groups have successfully reproduced the sample.
They have a video detecting zero resistance.
Sukbae Lee and his team are confident
APL materials review process : Ongoing
Patent registration: Ongoing
Why no samples and data? -> We are a corporation. Patent.
We are going to be proved by other researchers
There are still instabilities and other issues to be worked through.
There are currently limitations around a narrow range of magnetic fields.    Summary of today's announcement Lee still has confidence in superconductors.

IBM told to fix e-Justice after system collapse,2024-01-24T15:37:23+00:00,https://www.financialmirror.com/2024/01/24/ibm-told-to-fix-e-justice-after-system-collapse/,"The Cyprus governmentâ€™s IT and digital services agency has warned IBM to fix the glitches that caused the e-justice platform to collapse within a week of its launch or risk losing the contract. The system is supposed to digitise the electronic submission of all documents for most courts and allow access by all state agencies, including the police and the welfare department. However, after its launch on January 15, several glitches caused the system to collapse, resulting in the lawyers staging a one-hour strike on Wednesday. Neofytos Papadopoulos, the permanent secretary of the Deputy Ministry of Innovation, Research and Digital Strategy told members of the parliamentary committee on legal affairs that the contractor was given a strict deadline of five working days to address the identified issues. He said that according to a clause in the â‚? mln contract, failure to do so within the stipulated timeframe may result in the termination of the contract. The Bar Association said the failure was â€œunacceptableâ€?and that the system was supposed to be operational from December 18. Lawyers said the platform had major malfunctions and the contractor was given an initial extension to January 15 to fix them. Papadopoulos highlighted the three main areas that needed to be fixed: The collapse of the system tested lawyersâ€?patience, who staged a protest outside the parliament, arguing that the failure would only add more delays to the islandâ€™s notoriously slow Justice system. The Bar Association said a second demonstration has been planned for Friday outside district courthouses. In comments to state radio CyBC, the associationâ€™s chairman Michalis Vorkas dubbed the situation as intolerable and a complete debacle. He argued out that law offices were severely impacted, some individuals couldnâ€™t find their cases, and only physically registered cases were being tried. Vorkas highlighted recurrent glitches in online registrations, including payment issues. Users were randomly getting booted out, and system bugs even raised concerns about data security. â€œWe filed cases, only to receive a confirmation in gibberish,â€?he said. Despite continuous warnings from the Bar Association since 2022, and positive assurances prior to the system going live, Vorkas stressed that the new platform failed to meet expectations. He suggested the reinstatement of manual registration of cases and submission of documents to ensure uninterrupted access to justice. Responding to lawyersâ€?calls to going old school, Deputy Minister of Innovation Nikodemos Damianos while acknowledging the critical and complex nature of handling the platform, deemed it irresponsible to hastily shut down the system without exhausting solutions for repair. Damianos revealed that the system had undergone thirteen observation cycles over more than three years. The e-Justice platform replaced the i-Justice system introduced in 2021 during the pandemic restrictions, allowing for partial submission of documents and fili...",-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"New IBM-backed website supports young, socially conscious innovators",2024-01-24T14:25:58+00:00,https://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers/youth-space-young-social-innovators-ibm-funding,"by Blathnaid Oâ€™Dea
 
24 Jan 2024  Youth Space, developed by Young Social Innovators, received â‚?00,000 from IBM. It aims to provide an easy resource for budding entrepreneurs.  A new online resource that aims to encourage young people into entrepreneurial careers has been launched this week. The resource, called Youth Space, is an initiative by Young Social Innovators (YSI). YSI is a non-profit that works with young people to come up with innovative ways to effect positive change in their communities. It is supported by the Government as well as corporate partners such as Aviva, EirGrid and Virgin Media. It has been in operation for more than 20 years, but its latest venture is the online site, which is intended to function as a â€œone-stop shop for young social innovatorsâ€? according to YSI CEO Roger Warnock. Visitors to the site can avail of a â€œwealth of articles, polls and toolkits, plus an online, self-paced course,â€?Warnock added. â€œItâ€™s not just a website; itâ€™s a dedicated space to support a movement and a valuable resource for young change-makers.â€?YSI received financial backing from the Community Foundation and from tech giant IBM. The latter provided funding of â‚?00,000 towards the design and development of Youth Space. Deirdre Kennedy, IBM corporate social responsibility manager for social impact programmes, said the companyâ€™s support for young entrepreneurs is a no-brainer, as Youth Space is similar to a work environment which encourages collaborative and creative approaches to problem-solving. â€œWeâ€™re delighted to support the Youth Space platform, which will allow young curious minds to propose fresh ideas in a safe and secure environment and develop solutions that can make a difference to real-world challenges,â€?she said. Youth Space is divided into several main sections. There is a polls section where young people can share their thoughts; a section on funding; a section with resources and toolkits; a section on news and opportunities; and a section devoted to inspiration. More information on Youth Space and the supports it offers to young people hoping to get ahead in their careers is available on its website. 10 things you need to know direct to your inbox every weekday.

"AI adoption in Canada rising, but upskilling remains top barrier: IBM",2024-01-23T21:22:57+00:00,https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/ai-adoption-in-canada-rising-but-upskilling-remains-top-barrier-ibm/556849,"VideosÂ PodcastsBlogsSlideshows AI adoption among large organizations has remained steady globally, while Canada saw an uptick from 34 per cent in April 2023 to 37 per cent in November 2023, a new study by IBM Canada found. The company surveyed over 2,000 IT professionals in organizations with over 1,000 employees in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India and many more countries. In Canada, early adopters are leading the way, with 35 per cent of enterprises already working with AI with the aim to accelerate and increase investment in the technology. An additional 48 per cent of Canadian companies are still exploring using AI. The increased accessibility of AI tools (46 per cent), the need to reduce costs and automate key processes (46 per cent), as well as the increasing amount of AI embedded into standard off-the-shelf business applications (34 per cent) are the top factors driving AI adoption. However, despite the rise in adoption, AI investments are less likely to accelerate, notably as organizations struggle to find the right talent, the study highlighted. Limited AI skills and expertise (41 per cent) is, in fact, the number one barrier hindering successful AI adoption at enterprises both exploring and deploying AI. Around one-in-five (21 per cent) organizations do not have employees with the right skills in place to use new AI or automation tools, and 17 per cent cannot find new hires with the skills to address that gap. Plus, only 25 per cent are currently training or reskilling employees to work with new automation and AI tools. â€œTechnology is a critical engine driving transformation across industries, but as the gap between the skills organizations need in order to deliver digital transformation and the availability of a workforce with those skills widens, the strength of this engine is at risk,â€?affirmed Deb Pimentel, general manager, technology, IBM Canada. â€œSome of the challenges companies face include lack of customization to organizationsâ€?specific needs and goals, using a one-size-fits-all approach, ineffective ways of delivering the training, and limited opportunities to apply the skills in the real world.â€?Upskilling becomes even more tricky when companies do not yet know what the best use cases of AI are, or when the executives themselves are not using it at all, affirmed Jeremy Shaki, chief executive officer of Canadian tech education company, Lighthouse Labs. Added to that is the fact the tools and use cases are changing so rapidly that it makes it very difficult for most companies to know how exactly they should approach upskilling in the AI space, explained Shaki. The dominant narrative, that AI will provide opportunities for companies to have less people also does not help, added Shaki, because a pragmatic employee should see that and consider how they can remain in the company by being the user of AI who makes other roles redundant. â€œThe real reason to upskill in AI is because of the value and growth it will provid...",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IBMâ€™s sustainability software Envizi uses AI to green GHG gap,2024-01-22T10:10:45+00:00,https://www.greenprophet.com/2024/01/ibms-sustainability-software-uses-ai-to-streamline-ghg-emissions/," ESG environment social governance software. IBM (NYSE:IBM) has a new way to help companies accelerate the capture, calculation and analysis of Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through an AI tool it developed called Envizi. The new text classification capabilities in this software is designed to help enable a leap forward in efficiency and accuracy by helping organizations automatically ingest, organize and manage the spend data required for emissions calculations and external disclosures. Taking stock of greenhouse gases is a liability and a headache but when you do it right you can also get good green press and earn a Butterfly Mark (Positive Luxury) or B Corp status. Companies like Estee Lauder have taken it very seriously, aiming to not buy carbon credits but stop them at the source by using upgrades like solar energy. Findings released in the the IBM 2023 Sustainable Business Snapshot revealed that thereâ€™s a perception gap among corporate sustainability professionals, including sustainability and IT decision-makers. Some 93% of respondents think their company is somewhat or very mature in using data to track sustainability progress. But only 45% say they are ready to report on Scope 3 emissions. The sample included 250 participants from 13 markets, including US, UK, UAE, Australia,Â Brazil,Â France,Â Germany,Â India,Â Italy,Â Japan,Â Mexico,Â Singapore, andÂ Spain. IBMâ€™s new AI and emissions reporting tool called called Envizi has been helping organizations to collect, calculate, analyze and report on GHG emissions for over a decade. The product isnâ€™t a new startup promising the moon: it offers coverage for all 15 Scope 3 categories, using a calculation engine to apply GHG Protocol calculation methods that are underpinned by a robust data management system, says material provided by IMB. IBM sustainability GHG dashboard It includes automated data capture, supplier survey data capture, Scope 3 emissions factor libraries, reporting framework templates, a dedicated Scope 3 analytics dashboard, audit tools and functionality to support supplier benchmarking analysis. A spend-based emissions factor library that is harmonized across over 180 countries, creating uniformity in Scope 3 calculations for purchased good and services. These datasets are designed to help organizations to produce their emissions calculations quickly, accurately and efficiently. â€œGrowing regulatory requirements and external interests are driving organizations to disclose GHG emissions, including those from Scope 3,â€?saidÂ Christina Shim, VP and and Global Head, Product Management and Strategy, IBM Sustainability Software. â€œAs requirements increase and as organizations prioritize enhancing operational insights, so does the need for robust, auditable data management, calculation, and reporting processes. IBM Envizi is now integrated with the new capabilities to help organizations seamlessly garner insights from spend data to facilitate Scope 3 emissions calculations for ESG report...",3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Â  â€œIs quantum going to really create a cybersecurity Armageddon?â€?Ana Paula Assis, IBMâ€™s general manager of Europe, Middle East and Africa, said on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday. â€œItâ€™s going to.â€Â?Quantum computers, an emerging technology that vastly accelerates processing power by performing calculations in parallel rather than sequentially, will make existing encryption systems obsolete. IBM has developed many of the foundational technologies for the quantum era, which Assis said could arrive by 2030.Â  Read More: Quantum Computing Is Finally Here. But What Is It?: QuickTake Some governments are beginning to take the threat seriously. The US Senate, in a rare unanimous vote, passed a bill in 2022 addressing the threat of quantum computers on cryptography.

Most â€œcompanies do not have a robust roadmap yet as to how theyâ€™re going to use AI and quantum together to solve core problems,â€?Hidary said. He said a â€œtrainwreckâ€?is unfolding, estimating that it will take banks eight to ten years to transfer to post-quantum protocols, while scalable quantum computers will be available by 2029 or 2030.

"IBM, Verizon, Merck stocks lead Dow to new highs",2024-01-31T13:30:00+00:00,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/ibm-verizon-merck-stocks-lead-dow-to-new-highs/," You don't hear as much about the Dow Jones Industrial Average as investors did a few decades ago, as the broad consensus has deemed the S&P 500 a better indicator of market conditions. But the Dow is rallying to all-time highs, led by International Business Machines NYSE: IBM, Verizon Communications Inc. NYSE: VZ, Merck & Co. Inc. NYSE: MRK and perhaps an unlikely leader, insurance giant The Travelers Companies, Inc. NYSE: TRV. Those first three components, hailing from the ranks of technology stocks, telecom stocks and pharmaceutical stocks, make sense, as those areas have been in growth mode.Â  But insurance?Â  As a whole, the decidedly unglamorous insurance industry has been on a tear. The iShares U.S. Insurance ETF NYSEARCA: IAK advanced 6.85% in January.Â  Before reviewing the internals of the Dow itself, and whether it's become a relevant market indicator lately, take a look at the Travelers Companies chart. The stock leaped 6.72% on January 19 as the company reported core income more than doubled as premiums and income from investments rose, while catastrophe insurance payments declined. Personal insurance premiums climbed 13% as customers' rates increased. Travelers stock began rallying in late October and has posted a three-month gain of 32.01% and a January gain of 10.83%.Â  Sure, Travelers looks like a good stock at the moment, as it's trading at new highs, and analysts expect double-digit earnings growth this year and next. But its performance as a Dow leader is instructive, taken in context with fellow top performers IBM, Verizon and Merck. Here's where those four stocks stack up in terms of weightings in the S&P 500: You can pretty easily see that none of those are likely to make a dent in S&P performance to the degree of tech stalwarts and index heavyweights Microsoft Corp. NASDAQ: MSFT, Apple Inc. NASDAQ: AAPL, Nvidia Corp. NASDAQ: NVDA, Amazon.com Inc. NASDAQ: AMZN, Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ: GOOGL and Meta Platforms Inc. NASDAQ: META.Â  The influence those stocks have over S&P performance has been widely documented. Like the Dow, the S&P 500 is also trading at new highs, driven by AI business of stocks including Nvidia, Juniper Networks Inc. NYSE: JNPR and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. NASDAQ: AMD. But that brings us back to the question of whether the Dow has renewed value as a market indicator.Â  The S&P's market-cap weighting isn't reflecting the strength of IBM, Verizon, Merck and Travelers in its overall return. That arguably puts the Dow in a position of more accurately indicating market breadth beyond a handful of stocks rallying on the promise of AI.Â  It may seem old-fashioned to look to the Dow as a market indicator. That makes sense, given the Dow's inclusion of reliable dividend stocks such as Coca-Cola Co. NYSE: KO and 3M Co. NYSE: MMM, with less reliance on fast-moving, younger growth stocks.Â  Despite its smaller size compared to the S&P 500, the Dow's 30-stock concentration gives it some value as aÂ  snapshot of traditional blu...",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IBM stock jumps to 10-year high on accelerated AI growth,2024-01-31T13:05:00+00:00,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/ibm-stock-jumps-to-10-year-high-on-accelerated-ai-growth/," International Business Machines NYSE: IBM stock is trading at its best levels in nearly 10 years.Â  Take a look at the IBM chart: The stock is up 14.42% in the past month and up 32.47% in the past three months. The stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base in November, clearing a buy point above $151.93.Â  IBM stock gapped up 9.49% on January 25 after beating fourth-quarter views, as you can see using MarketBeat's IBM earnings data. The company topped analysts' forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. What's behind the beats and the stock's move? As with any tech stock, you may first guess that AI is the reason, and that would be correct.Â  In the fourth quarter earnings report, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said, ""In the fourth quarter, we grew revenue in all of our segments, driven by continued adoption of our hybrid cloud and AI offerings. Client demand for AI is accelerating and our book of business for watsonx and generative AI roughly doubled from the third to the fourth quarter."" Krishna referred to IBM's watsonx AI platform, launched in 2023. The technology allows users to build and train AI models for a variety of business applications.Â  IBM has been touting its AI business for the past several quarters, but this marked the largest single-day AI-driven price move since the launch of watsonx.Â  Analysts expect IBM to earn $10.13 per share this year, a growth of 5% over 2023. Next year, that's seen rising by another 6% to $10.71 a share.Â  IBM long ago reinvented itself as a tech consultant, rather than a hardware maker.Â  Investors didn't consider IBM among the chief beneficiaries of AI in 2023, although the stock posted a one-year gain of 44.18% as shareholders understood the potential was there.Â  That potential seems to have been realized, as earnings growth accelerated in the past three quarters, and revenue is growing again after being stagnant from late 2022 through mid-2023.Â  IBM is making clear to investors that it's earned its place among the top artificial intelligence stocks.Â  In the earnings report, IBM chief financial officer James Kavanaugh cited revenue growth, as well as profit margin expansion, increased productivity gains and strong cash generation as strengths in the quarter. ""Throughout 2023, those strengths enabled us to increase our investment in R&D and talent, and complete nine acquisitions to bolster our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, all while continuing to return value to shareholders through our dividend,"" he said. The IBM dividend yield is 3.53%; the company has a 28-year track record of increasing its shareholder payout. That lands IBM a spot on MarketBeat's list of dividend achievers. Over the past decade, IBM has returned capital to shareholders through share buybacks. That reduces the number of shares outstanding, which increases earnings per share. That, in turn, has the effect of boosting investor confidence, often leading to a higher share price.Â  IBM earnings have increased for the past three years. The compa...",3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

				Remote workers, excluding those with specific exemptions such as medical issues or military service, must relocate closer to an IBM office by the beginning of August.			  Amid mixed reactions to companies attempting to end remote work, IBM has asked all its US managers to return to the office or leave the job, according to a Bloomberg report. In a memo dated January 16, senior VP John Granger said that all managers based in the US must now report to an office or client location for a minimum of three days each week, irrespective of their current work arrangement. Remote workers, excluding those with specific exemptions such as medical issues or military service, must relocate closer to an IBM office by the beginning of August. Typically, this involves residing within a 50-mile (approximately 80 kilometers) radius. The company will utilize badge-in data to evaluate individual attendance. Managers who donâ€™t relocate and are unable to secure a role thatâ€™s approved to be remote must â€œseparate from IBM.â€?Significantly, this comes after IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said in May last year that the company plans to use AI to replace 7,800 jobs over the next five years. Prior to that, IBM had said it would cut about 3,900 jobs, or 1.5% of its workforce, to reduce costs. In September, IBM asked employees at its software division to return to the office. Unlike the latest decision to ask US managers, the previous mandate was issued to employees worldwide. The new mandate arrives amid a backdrop of varying opinions among employees and companies regarding the advantages of discontinuing remote work. A recent survey by Resumebuilder showed that 90% of companies plan to stop working from home by the end of 2024. About 24% said they would threaten to fire employees who donâ€™t comply. However, another survey by Envoy showed that 80% of executives regret the initial steps taken to bring employees back to the office. The Bloomberg report added that despite the implementation of new regulations, office attendance in 2023 exhibited limited growth, as per data provided by Kastle Systems. Within the ten largest business districts in the US, the presence of employees in offices remained at approximately 50% of pre-pandemic levels, with technology-centric regions such as the San Francisco Bay Area recording even lower percentages. IBM did not respond to detailed email queries.Â  â€œIBM is focused on providing a work environment that balances flexibility with the face-to-face interactions that make us more productive, innovative, and better able to serve our clients,â€?the company told Bloomberg. â€œConsistent with that approach, weâ€™re requiring executives and people managers in the United States to be in the office at least three days per week.â€?Prasanth Aby Thomas is a contributing writer.",-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 International Business Machines Corp. delivered a companywide ultimatum to managers who are still working remotely: move near an office or leave the company. All US managers must immediately report to an office or client location at least three days a week â€œregardless of current work location status,â€?according to a memo sent on January 16 viewed by Bloomberg. Badge-in data will be used to â€œassess individual presenceâ€?and shared with managers and human resources, Senior Vice President John Granger wrote in the note. Those working remotely, other than employees with exceptions such as medical issues or military service, who donâ€™t live close enough to commute to a facility must relocate near an IBM office by the start of August, according to the memo. That generally means within 50 miles (80 kilometers), according to a person familiar with the rule who asked not to be identified speaking about corporate policy. Managers who donâ€™t agree to relocate and are unable to secure a role thatâ€™s approved to be remote must â€œseparate from IBM,â€?Granger wrote. â€œIBM is focused on providing a work environment that balances flexibility with the face-to-face interactions that make us more productive, innovative and better able to serve our clients,â€?a company spokesperson said. â€œConsistent with that approach, weâ€™re requiring executives and people managers in the United States to be in the office at least three days per week.â€?Chief Executive Office Arvind Krishna has long touted the importance of in-person work. In a May 2023 interview with Bloomberg, Krishna said that promotions will be rarer for those who arenâ€™t on-site. Some teams within IBM had already instituted office attendance requirements. IBM has slimmed its operations to focus on software and services in recent years, introduced new products to capitalize on interest in artificial intelligence and divested its managed infrastructure, weather and health businesses. Executives gave a positive outlook for 2024 with fourth-quarter earnings last week, sending shares to their best day in almost four years. Big Blue expects to reduce jobs this year, spending a similar amount on restructuring as it did last year when it planned to cut 3,900 workers, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh said last week. Return-to-office mandates are often seen as fuelling attrition. IBM had about 2,88,000 workers globally at the end of 2022. The company has closed a number of offices since the onset of the pandemic, potentially complicating return-to-office plans for workers. That includes in central New York State, Southbury, Connecticut, and Iowa. Reducing its real estate footprint is part of IBMâ€™s ongoing margin-expansion efforts, Kavanaugh said during an earnings call last week. It couldnâ€™t be determined how many managers would be required to move under the new rules. Many comp...",-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 The ""dream"" of having this centralized massive computer where people connect their dumb terminals to and pay rental for computing time.Many names, many disguises, from time to time this nightmare comes back to life like dracula on that konami franchise, and it has to be put down again before its too late.One day the megacorps may get to dumb people enough to finally accept it instead of just fighting it tooth and nail as has been for decades. But we aren't connecting dumb terminals to the cloud (with some exceptions). The cloud is far more analogous to the commodity servers in a company's data centers today than it is to mainframes. Moving away from mainframes was in part because commodity servers gave more flexibility, and the cloud provides even more flexibility than owning your own servers. The cloud is a continuation of the forces which moved us away from mainframes in the first place, not a movement back towards the mainframe. You've missed the point. These days, commodity hardware underneath your desk is 90% more-powerful/more-capable than whatever commodity hardware you are actually leveraging in your timeshared cloudy contractYeah but nowadays, all that power is required to run the modern version of a dumb terminal, bloated web browsers running bloated ""cloud"" web applications. /s You've missed the point.

Cloud makes sense where a business has rapidly changing needs, so it's not worth buying and operating enough servers to meet the maximum capacity requirements that only come into play rarely. Remember when sites used to get Slashdotted? CDNs solved that, because a site can go from 10 hits a day to 10 million and back again, and the CDN has the capacity to handle the spike. The other advantage is not having to maintain servers and software yourself.

Tech layoffs in 2024: A timeline,2024-01-26T20:32:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685936/tech-layoffs-in-2023-a-timeline.html#tk.rss_all,"
				Technology companies have continued to lay off staff in 2024, despite improving fundamentals. Here's an updated timeline of notable layoffs, and reasons why Big Tech is in turmoil.			  After two years of massive layoffs at IT companies, 2024 was expected to be a year of recovery for the IT industry. While there are early signs of that, with global IT spending expected to increase 8% to cross $5.1 trillion in 2024 according to Gartner, jobs continue to be impacted in the sector. Some of the layoffs being seen this year are an extension of job cuts announced in 2023. Last year, tech giants including Amazon, Cisco, Facebook parent company Meta, Microsoft, Google, IBM, SAP, and Salesforceâ€”as well as many smaller companies â€”announced sweeping job cuts. The problem: Big Tech went on a hiring binge during the pandemic when lockdowns sparked a tech buying spree to support remote work and an uptick in e-commerce, and now they face revenue declines. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,186 tech companies laid off about 262,682 staff in 2023, compared to 164,969 layoffs in 2022. In 2024, 168 tech companies have already laid off 42,324 employees. Here is a listâ€”to be updated regularlyâ€”of some of the most prominent technology layoffs the industry has experienced recently. Feb. 14: Cisco cuts 5% of workforce Cisco will shed 4,200 of its 84,900 employees as it refocuses on more profitable areas of its business, including AI and security. The companyâ€™s last major round of layoffs was in November 2022. Ciscoâ€™s sales of telecommunications equipment have been hit by delays at telcos in rolling out equipment they havealready purchased. AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billionsâ€”and thatâ€™s before it announcedÂ its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications.Â  Feb. 6 DocuSign will lay off 6% of workforce in restructuring Digital workflow company DocuSign will lay off 440 of its 7,336 staff as it seeks to cut costs. The lay-offs come amid reports that attempts to sell the company to investment firms have fallen apart after a failure to agree on price. Jan. 25: Microsoft axes 1,900 workers in its gaming division Roughly 8% of Microsoftâ€™s Gaming division is headed for unemployment, the company announced Thursday, with the lionâ€™s share of job cuts affecting the newly acquired Activision Blizzard subsidiary. Microsoft completed its purchase of Activision Blizzard in October 2023, paying nearly $69 billion. About 1,900 employees will be let go, along with two executives at Blizzard: Mike Ybarra and Allen Adham. A pending survival game title, according to Reuters, has also been cancelled. The layoffs were largely expected in the wake of the Microsoft acquisition. Jan. 24:Â SAP announces $2.2B restructuring program thatâ€™ll impact 8,000 jobs German enterprise software giant SAP said this week that 8...",-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IBM's Earnings: Surprising Revenue Growth Acceleration,2024-01-25T10:32:29+00:00,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4664883-ibm-earnings-surprising-revenue-growth-acceleration?source=feed_all_articles,"Ethan Miller Ethan Miller IBM (NYSE:IBM) positively surprised investors with its impressive guidance together with its Q4 2023 results. Here, I contend that IBM's newly found acceleration of its revenue growth rates was a very attractive surprise. That being said, this is far from a blemish-free investment thesis. Most crucially, I find that its balance sheet will be a heavy anchor standing in the way of investors' full upside potential. That being said, there's a lot to like in this story. Overall, I find myself bullish on the stock. IBM's near-term prospects appear promising as evidenced by their robust performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the full-year results, demonstrating growth across various segments and strong cash generation. As IBM discussed during its earnings call, the company's strategic focus on enhancing its Software portfolio, particularly with the introduction of the flagship AI and data platform, watsonx, reflects a commitment to innovation. The emphasis on AI and hybrid cloud solutions positions IBM well to meet the growing demand for technology-driven productivity and efficiency enhancements among clients. Additionally, the sustained growth in consulting and strategic partnerships with industry leaders further strengthens IBM's position. The company's leadership is optimistic about achieving their midterm revenue model, with the diversified business model allowing for continued progress in each quarter. Despite the positive outlook, IBM faces challenges in the near term. The competitive landscape in the technology sector is intense, and while IBM has made significant strides in AI and hybrid cloud, the industry is dynamic, and continuous innovation is crucial. Case in point, can IBM remain relevant in this highly disruptive space? The macro environment, while driven by strong technology demand, remains somewhat uneven. Moreover, while the company highlights achievements in consulting, the challenges associated with addressing client demands for data architecture, security, and governance are acknowledged as critical and hard. As you can imagine, IBM has disruptive competitors in practically every sector, particularly in security. Navigating these complexities and ensuring that consulting expertise remains a key differentiator in the market will be vital. Given this context, let's delve into IBM's financials. IBM revenue growth rates IBM revenue growth rates IBM guides to grow by around 5% at constant currency but with approximately 1% currency headwind. This means that investors will be expecting to see ""some"" growth from IBM's 2023 revenues. For a business that many had long ago given up on, as a dead company walking, the fact that IBM has somehow found a way to guide for mid-single-digit revenue growth, implies that the business is going to reaccelerate its growth rates. For investors, there's little better news, than a company that's re-accelerating its revenue growth rates. SA Premium SA Premium In practical term...",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth of enterprise adoption of AI due to deployment by early adopters: reportÂ ,2024-02-09T13:25:31+00:00,https://newsbytes.ph/2024/02/09/growth-of-enterprise-adoption-of-ai-due-to-deployment-by-early-adopters-report/,"New research commissioned by IBM has found that about 42% of enterprise-scale organizations (over 1,000 employees) surveyed have AI actively in use in their businesses. Early adopters are leading the way, with 59% of responding enterprises already working with AI intending to accelerate and increase investment in the technology. Ongoing challenges for AI adoption in enterprises remain, including hiring employees with the right skillsets, data complexity, and ethical concerns continue to inhibit businesses from adopting AI technologies into their operations. â€œWeâ€™re seeing that the early adopters who overcame barriers to deploy AI are making further investments, proving to me that they are already experiencing the benefits from AI. More accessible AI tools, the drive for automation of key processes, and increasing amounts of AI embedded into off-the-shelf business applications are top factors driving the expansion of AI at the enterprise level,â€?said Rob Thomas, senior vice president at IBM Software. â€œWe see organizations leveraging AI for use cases where I believe the technology can most quickly have a profound impact like IT automation, digital labor, and customer care.

Consumers turn to AI-driven shopping â€?IBM study,2024-02-07T07:52:57+00:00,https://www.bworldonline.com/bw-launchpad/2024/02/07/574168/consumers-turn-to-ai-driven-shopping-ibm-study/," More consumers are expressing interest in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven retail, saying they are unsatisfied with the current retail methods, according to a study. IBM Institute for Business Valueâ€™s 2024 consumer study, â€œRevolutionize retail with AI everywhere: Customers wonâ€™t wait,â€?revealed only 9% of the 20,000 consumers polled said they were happy with their in-store shopping experience, while 14% of online shoppers said the same. The study was conducted in 26 countries. Luq Niazi, Global Managing Director at IBM, said the multitude of choices given to todayâ€™s consumers presents them with more options than ever before. â€œWe are seeing that todayâ€™s consumers, faced with more choices and channels than ever, are increasingly making their purchasing decisions based on the cost and the quality of experiences that retailers provide,â€?he said in a statement. Instead of being discouraged by the results of the study, Mr. Naziq said retailers should view it as an opportunity. â€œLeveraging advances in AI technologies, retailers can forge ahead into a new era of commerce and fulfilment, leading with innovation to create shopping experiences that are as intuitive, unified, personalized and efficient,â€?he added. Additionally, consumers are aware that brands and retailers are capable of delivering the services their clients need, but that they need to step up and do so. Around 80% of consumers who have yet to encounter AI in their shopping activities say they want to use the technology for researching products and look for deals, among other concerns. â€œMore than half say they would like to use virtual assistants (55%), augmented or virtual reality (55%), and AI applications (59%) as they shop,â€?the study said. Adapting these changes would benefit consumers, as 23% use technology and are open to try new digital shopping experiences. Among the other takeaways from the study include that over half (52%) of respondents want to receive information and offers from stores that pique their interest, but 40% are concerned and want more control over the data they share with companies. Customers want digital integration, said the study. â€œConsumers surveyed showed a strong interest in using AI technology to enhance various aspects of their shopping. Most consumers (59%) said they would like to use AI applications as they shop and 4 in 5 consumers who havenâ€™t used the technology for shopping reported an interest in trying it,â€?said the IBM study, but those polled said they want the experience to be personalized for a more satisfying result. The study also showed that consumers want more flexible payment options, owing to economic challenges. â€œConsumers surveyed are seeking flexible payment options, with 55% desiring more varied payment options and 46% reporting they would like to pay for their purchase in installments,â€?it said. â€?P.

IBM teams up with NCS to prepare Asean for â€˜quantumâ€?threats,2024-02-07T06:54:17+00:00,https://newsbytes.ph/2024/02/07/ibm-teams-up-with-ncs-to-prepare-asean-for-quantum-threats/,"Tech titan IBM and multinational IT company NCS held a virtual media briefing on Wednesday, Jan. 31, to announce the signing of an agreement formalizing their collaboration to prepare the Asean region for the growing threat posed by advancing quantum computing. Quantum computing is the technology that utilizes the laws of quantum mechanics to work out computing problems considered unsolvable by classical computers. These capabilities could lead to valuable discoveries such as the easier identification of fraud patterns or accelerating the development of new materials.Â Â  Like any powerful tool, though, quantum computers can be exploited. No quantum computer that can outperform classical computers exists today, but IBM stresses that quantum super computers will soon render obsolete the prime factorization principle that underlies the encryption protocols governments and corporations worldwide employ to protect sensitive information. During the briefing, Ray Harishankar, IBM Fellow from IBM Quantum Safe, described how bad actors can wield the technology. For instance, attackers will be able to decode confidential data stolen even years back, target legacy systems with fraudulent software updates, manipulate digital evidence, and expose encrypted messages sent over telecommunications networks. â€œWhile we are not in the business of speculating when things may occur. We believe that by early 2030s, we would have a cryptographically relevant quantum computer,â€?Harishankar stated. Countries around the world are beginning to address the danger before it materializes. In fact, Lory Thorpe, IBM Research Quantum Safe industry lead, mentioned during the briefing that countries in Europe are holding discussions with IBM about the dangers of quantum computing. Twelve nations worldwide have also introduced post-quantum government initiatives. Dr. Lim Hoon Wei, R&D and Special Ops principle director at NCS Group, underscored the gravity of the threat by saying: â€œAccording to the world economic forum, a staggering 20 billion digital devices â€?ATMs, smartphones, and so on â€?are projected to require upgrading or replacement to quantum-safe cryptography in the next one to two decades.â€?Based on these estimates, IBM is urging Asean governments and organizations to prepare against the quantum threat as early as now because migrating data to quantum-safe encryption is a process that they estimate can take seven to ten years to complete. The collaboration with NCS is one of the first steps to ready Asean against quantum computer risks. The MOU signed by these two companies outlines plans to co-develop and provide end-to-end quantum-safe and privacy-enhancing services for public agencies and enterprises in Singapore. Singapore is an ideal place to center their initial efforts as it is one of the 12 countries that are already acting on risks posed by quantum computers by launching a post-quantum cryptography government initiative. Both IBM and NCS, however, aim to expand th...",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All this and more on the â€œyou do know those pictures arenâ€™t real, donâ€™t youâ€?edition of Hashtag Trending. Iâ€™m your host Jim Love, CIO of IT World Canada and TechNewsDay in the US. Mozilla is stepping up its privacy game with a new subscription service aimed at tackling the pervasive issue of personal data being sold on the web. Through its Mozilla Monitor platform, the tech giant now offers a way for users to not only detect but also remove their sensitive information from data broker sites automatically. This service, an extension of the previously free Firefox Monitor, is designed to simplify the complex and often opaque process of reclaiming oneâ€™s digital footprint. For a monthly fee, Mozilla Monitor Plus will scour over 190 data broker sites for your personal detailsâ€”like your phone number, email, and home addressâ€”and initiate removal requests on your behalf. This proactive approach is a game-changer in the fight against data brokers, who profit from selling personal information without the explicit consent of individuals. The significance of this service cannot be overstated. In an era where data breaches are all too common, affecting millions annually, having the ability to automatically remove personal information from potentially harmful sites is a substantial step towards enhancing online privacy and security. Mozillaâ€™s commitment to privacy is further underscored by their encryption and privacy policy adherence, ensuring usersâ€?data is handled with the utmost care. In conclusion, Mozilla Monitor Plus represents a critical advancement in personal data protection, offering users peace of mind and control over their online presence. As we navigate the digital age, such tools are indispensable in safeguarding our personal information against unauthorized use and sale.

Quantum computing: The data security conundrum,2024-02-06T19:53:36+00:00,https://betanews.com/2024/02/06/quantum-computing-the-data-security-conundrum/,"One of the biggest challenges of digital technology today is around security systems and data. In response to this, sophisticated algorithms have been designed to encrypt data and protect it through frameworks known as symmetric cryptography. While this has proven successful, advancements in quantum computing -- which utilizes quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than conventional computers -- could potentially turn data security on its head. IBM, Microsoft and Google have already turned their attention to quantum computing and, as a result, commercially viable quantum computers are not too far from becoming a reality. In fact the global quantum computing market size in terms of revenue was estimated to be USD 866 Million in 2023 and is poised to reach USD 4,375 Million by 2028,Â growing at a CAGR of 38.3 percent from 2023 to 2028.Â This is raising concerns that these computers might pose a threat to current public-key cryptography algorithms and potentially expose sensitive data. As such, data security needs to be a step ahead, with more advanced cryptographic algorithms that minimise potential risks and ensure the safeguarding of data in a quantum computing world.  Quantum-resistant data security is a concern as current approaches to data protection use algorithms that traditional computing power would take several years to crack. The improved processing power of quantum computing would, however, reduce this time significantly and its ability to solve mathematical problems and speed up certain complex mathematical computations could result in the encryption algorithms that we use becoming obsolete. This would create risk detrimental to businesses, universities, governments and more. This is supported by aÂ ForresterÂ study that anticipates that quantum computers will be able to crack all current cryptosystems in the next five to 30 years, with a majority claiming there is an up to 70 percent chance of this occurring in the next 5 years. As such, it is no wonder that Gartner has stressed the importance of preparing for quantumâ€™s impact by encouraging the promotion of privacy-enhancing technologies in anticipation of the quantum era. This is a valid suggestion as some classical cryptography algorithms will not be able to stand up against quantum computingâ€™s processing abilities and will succumb to a brute-force assault. However, while quantum computing is widely considered a potential risk for data security, it could potentially also be a part of the solution, as quantum cybersecurity may provide a more robust and compelling opportunity to safeguard critical data.  According toÂ IBM, quantum computing can aid in providing a more robust way to safeguard critical data than current offerings. In particular, quantum machine learning and quantum random number generation are believed to provide a viable solution to securing data while at the same time wielding the power to detect and deflect quantum-era cyberattacks before they can cause harm....",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Â Some companies may still be sitting on a fortune in â€?classic IP addresses. IBM is the leader in AI patents, but does it really matter? And you can slow global warming with AI, a robot and a new kind of asphalt. All this and more on the springtime in Winnipeg, axle wrecking edition of Hashtag Trending. Iâ€™m your host Jim Love, CIO of IT World Canada and TechNewsDay in the US. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, admitted to what weâ€™ve all known as he addressed user complaints about ChatGPTâ€™s performance by announcing an update designed to make the AI less â€œlazy.â€?Following reports of the chatbot failing to complete tasks and offering lackluster responses, the update aims to get ChatGPT to be more responsive. This adjustment follows observations from users and developers about the AIâ€™s inconsistent behavior, including an instance where it gave shorter answers based on the perceived time of year. In some cases, the responses from ChatGPT were â€?if you want more information visit this website, in other words â€?do it yourself. Interestingly, my own experimentation showed that when you used Bing as the search engine, responses were shorter and less interesting than if you used WebPilot, the app that first gave ChatGPT the ability to access the web directly. I also had promised to give the results of my testing on the weekend, but there were real problems with ChatGPT breaking down every few minutes, so it might be a few more days before we are done. Sources include: Business Insider And do you mind if we nerd out for minute here. IPv4, or Internet Protocol version 4, is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP), which is a set of rules that define how data is sent and received over the Internet. It was first deployed for production within the ARPANET in 1983 and is still used to route most Internet traffic today, despite the ongoing deployment of its successor, IPv6. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, allowing for approximately 4.3 billion unique addresses, but its address supply is depleted, leading to the gradual transition to IPv6, which has a much larger address space. IPv4 is an essential part of the internetâ€™s internetworking methods and is supported on all network devices. It is known for its simplicity, ease of setup, and widespread compatibility with devices. However, due to the limited number of available addresses, the transition to IPv6 is necessary to accommodate the growing number of devices and networks. Iâ€™m not that articulate, I pulled that off Perplexity, a new AI search app that you might want to check out. But thatâ€™s the general wisdom. But it turns out that IP advisory boutiqueÂ Kalorama GroupÂ has quietly been selling IPv4 addresses to the tune of $1.2 billion as of the end of 2023.The firm specializes in handling large-scale transactions of this type of IP address â€?facilitating deals involving 1 million addresses.

IBM LinuxONE 4 Express protects sensitive private data,2024-02-06T11:00:09+00:00,https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/06/ibm-linuxone-4-express/,"IBM announced IBM LinuxONE 4 Express, extending the latest performance, security and AI capabilities of LinuxONE to small and medium sized businesses and within new data center environments.   The pre-configured rack mount system is designed to offer cost savings and to remove client guess work when spinning up workloads quickly and getting started with the platform to address new and traditional use cases such as digital assets, medical imaging with AI, and workload consolidation. As businesses move their products and services online quickly, oftentimes, they are left with a hybrid cloud environment created by default, with siloed stacks that are not conducive to alignment across businesses or the introduction of AI. In a recent IBM IBV survey, 84% of executives asked acknowledged their enterprise struggles in eliminating silo-to-silo handoffs.

The first company to do so was IBM Korea. In 2011, the Korean unit of the US firm announced a job posting that expressed a preference for hiring individuals from sexual minority groups. Major Korean firms, including Samsung, SK, LG and Posco, prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation through their company guidelines. Still, Korean workplaces are generally the last place where an LGBTQ+ worker would consider revealing their sexual orientation. In a survey conducted by local civic group Dawoom of 3,431 participants identifying as from sexual minority groups, 66.3 percent of respondents said they were most hesitant to reveal their sexual identity at workplaces, due to fears of violence, threats and harassment. Schools, family environments and public places followed. The same survey asked to whom they came out, and only 7.3 percent of respondents -- the smallest portion -- reported having disclosed their sexual orientation to their boss. The second-smallest portion of respondents, 15.2 percent, said they had come out to colleagues at work. The survey found that 78 percent of respondents shared their sexual orientation with non-sexual minority friends, which was the highest percentage. This portion was followed by mothers, counselors, medical workers and fathers.   Is South Korea really becoming more diverse? The Korea Herald offers a reality check by examining data on representation in the fields of politics, business and society according to gender, age, ability, sexual identity and nationality.

The CBI has registered the case on the recommendation of the Central Vigilance Commission which found prima facie procedural irregularities in the procurement of the software, according to people in the investigation agency in know of the development. After nearly six years of probe, the CBI has filed a charge sheet against former CMD Air India Arvind Jadhav, IBM India Private Limited, SAP India Private Limited and six others under the IPC section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, they said. The CVC, in the note to the CBI, said that initial probe by Air India's chief vigilance officer shows that the national carrier had selected the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software system from SAP AG without following proper tendering procedure. It was also alleged that there was no approval from the civil aviation ministry even though Air India had claimed that it had made a presentation before the Group of Secretaries on July 9, 2009, and before the Group of Ministers in 2010. The commission had said that Air India had selected the software from the largest ERP provider of the world without justifying the need for the same since already a similar system of Oracle was in operation. It was stated that the Oracle system had some problems but no efforts were apparently made to either set them right or upgrade the existing system. Also, open tender system was not adopted for procurement of new ERP software, the CVC said in the note.

IBM says generative AI can help automate business actions,2024-02-02T08:29:19+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-says-generative-ai-can-help-automate-business-actions/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular A big focus of enterprise work these days is to automate human tasks for greater efficiency. Computer giant IBM asks in its most recent research whether generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as large language models (LLMs), can be a stepping stone to automation. Called ""SNAP"", IBM's proposed software framework trains an LLM to generate a prediction of the next action to take place in a business process given all of the events that have come before. Those predictions, in turn, can serve as suggestions for what steps a business can take.Â  Also: I'm taking AI image courses for free on Udemy with this little trick - and you can too ""SNAP can improve the next activity prediction performance for various BPM [business process management] datasets,"" write Alon Oved and colleagues at IBM Research in a new paper, SNAP: Semantic Stories for Next Activity Prediction,Â published this week on the arXiv pre-print server.Â  IBM's work is just one example of a trend toward using LLMs to try to predict the next event or action in a series. Scholars have been doing work with what's called time series data -- data that measures the same variables at different points in time to spot trends. The IBM work doesn't use time series data, but it does focus on the notion of events in sequence and likely outcomes. Also:Â AI is outperforming our best weather forecasting tech, thanks to DeepMind SNAP is an acronym for ""semantic stories for the next activity prediction"". Next-activity prediction (the NAP part of SNAP) is an existing, decades-old area of systems research. NAP typically uses older forms of AI to predict what will happen next after all the steps up to that point have been input, usually from a log of the business, which is a practice known as ""process mining"". The semantic stories element of SNAP is the part that IBM adds to the framework. The idea is to use the richness of language in programs such as GPT-3 to go beyond the activities of traditional AI programs. The language models can capture more details of a business process, and turn them it into a coherent ""story"" in natural language.Â  Older AI programs can't handle all the data about business processes, write Oved and team. They ""utilize only the sequence of activities as input to generate a classification model,"" and, ""Rarely are the additional numerical and categorical attributes taken into account within such a framework for predictions."" Also:Â Why Nvidia is teaching robots to twirl pens and how generative AI is helping An LLM, in contrast, can pick out many more details and mold them into a story. An example is a loan application. The application process contains several steps. The LLM can be fed various items from the database about the loan amount, such as ""amount = $20,000"" and ""request start date = Aug 20, 2023"".Â  Those data items can be automatically fashioned by the LLM into a natural language narrative, such as: ""The requested loan amount was 20,000$, and it was requested by the...",3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tech giants sign voluntary pledge to fight election-related deepfakes,2024-02-16T19:55:45+00:00,https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/16/tech-giants-sign-voluntary-pledge-to-fight-election-related-deepfakes/,"Tech companies are pledging to fight election-related deepfakes as policymakers amp up pressure. Today at the Munich Security Conference, vendors including Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon, Adobe and IBM signed an accord signaling their intention to adopt a common framework for responding to AI-generated deepfakes intended to mislead voters. Thirteen other companies, including AI startups OpenAI, Anthropic, Inflection AI, ElevenLabs and Stability AI and social media platforms X (formerly Twitter), TikTok and Snap, joined in signing the accord, along with chipmaker Arm and security firms McAfee and TrendMicro. The undersigned said theyâ€™ll use methods to detect and label misleading political deepfakes when theyâ€™re created and distributed on their platforms, sharing best practices with one another and providing â€œswift and proportionate responsesâ€?when deepfakes start to spread. The companies added that theyâ€™ll pay special attention to context in responding to deepfakes, aiming to â€œ[safeguard] educational, documentary, artistic, satirical and political expressionâ€?while maintaining transparency with users about their policies on deceptive election content. The accord is effectively toothless and, some critics may say, amounts to little more than virtue signaling â€?its measures are voluntary. But the ballyhooing shows a wariness among the tech sector of regulatory crosshairs as they pertain to elections, in a year when 49% of the worldâ€™s population will head to the polls in national elections. â€œThereâ€™s no way the tech sector can protect elections by itself from this new type of electoral abuse,â€?Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, said in a press release. â€œAs we look to the future, it seems to those of us who work at Microsoft that weâ€™ll also need new forms of multistakeholder action â€?Itâ€™s abundantly clear that the protection of elections [will require] that we all work together.â€?No federal law in the U.S. bans deepfakes, election-related or otherwise. But 10 states around the country have enacted statutes criminalizing them, with Minnesotaâ€™s being the first to target deepfakes used in political campaigning. Elsewhere, federal agencies have taken what enforcement action they can to combat the spread of deepfakes. This week, the FTC announced that itâ€™s seeking to modify an existing rule that bans the impersonation of businesses or government agencies to cover all consumers, including politicians. And the FCCÂ moved to make AI-voiced robocalls illegal by reinterpreting a rule that prohibits artificial and prerecorded voice message spam. In the European Union, the blocâ€™s AI Act would require all AI-generated content to be clearly labeled as such. The EUâ€™s also using its Digital Services Act to force the tech industry to curb deepfakes in various forms. Deepfakes continue to proliferate, meanwhile. According to data from Clarity, a deepfake detection firm, the number of deepfakes that have been created increased 900% year over year. Last mo...",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indian Companies At Forefront Of AI Deployments: IBM Report,2024-02-15T12:10:37+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/indian-companies-at-forefront-of-ai-deployments-ibm-report,"As much as 59% of enterprise-scale organisations with over 1,000 employees have artificial intelligence actively in use in their businesses, according to an IBM survey. India leads among all the countries surveyed. The IBM Global AI Adoption Index 2023, conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of IBM, found early adopters are leading the way, with 74% of those Indian enterprises already working with AI, having accelerated their investments in AI in the past two years in areas like research & development and workforce reskilling. Ongoing challenges for AI adoption remain, including hiring employees with the right skillsets and ethical concerns, inhibiting businesses from adopting AI technologies into their operations. Therefore, in 2024, addressing these inhibitors would be a priority, like providing people with the relevant skills to work with AI and having a robust AI governance framework. ""The increase in AI adoption and investments by Indian enterprises is a good indicator that they are already experiencing the benefits from AI,"" Sandip Patel, managing director of IBM India & South Asia, said. ""However, there is still a significant opportunity to accelerate as many businesses are hesitant to move beyond experimentation and deploy AI at scale."" ""To harness its full potential in the coming months, data and AI governance tools are going to be critical for building AI models responsibly that enterprises can trust and confidently adopt. Without the use of governance tools, AI can expose companies to data privacy issues, legal complications, and ethical dilemmas--cases of which we have already seen plaguing many across the world,"" he said. Today, 59% of IT professionals at large organisations report that they have actively deployed AI while an additional 27% are actively exploring using the technology. Similarly, approximately six in 10 IT professionals at enterprises report that their company is actively implementing generative AI and another 34% are exploring it. As much as 74% of IT professionals at companies deploying or exploring AI indicate that their company has accelerated their investments in or rollout of AI in the past 24 months in areas like R&D (67%), reskilling/workforce development (55%) and building proprietary AI solutions (53%). Easier-to-use AI, tools and the need to reduce costs and automate processes are driving AI adoption among surveyed companies. Advances in AI tools that make them more accessible (59%), the need to reduce costs and automate key processes (48%), and the increasing amount of AI embedded into standard off-the-shelf business applications (47%) are the top factors driving AI adoption. The top five barriers hindering successful AI adoption at enterprises, both exploring or deploying AI, are limited AI skills and expertise (30%), lack of tools/platforms for developing AI models (28%), AI projects are too complex or difficult to integrate and scale (27%), ethical concerns (26%) and too much data complexity (25%).

15 Feb 2024  Sizzle AI founder Jerome Pesenti. With experience leading AI teams for Meta and IBM, Jerome Pesenti knows the potential of this technology, but his current focus is on boosting equity in education.  AI has surged in popularity in recent years, but this is no surprise to Jerome Pesenti, the founder of Sizzle AI. Before his venture into edtech, Pesenti was an influential figure in the world of AI. He was the VP of AI at Meta, where he led the companyâ€™s AI team between 2018 and 2022. During this period, the company was working on multiple ambitious AI projects, including universal speech translation and large language models to support AI researchers. Before this, Pesenti also led a global team of researchers and software engineers within IBM Watson, where he helped develop â€œstate-of-the-art software in question and answering, dialog, speech, natural language processing and automated machine translationâ€? â€œWe built some of the first AI cloud services,â€?Pesenti said. Pesenti said one of his passions at Meta was making the companyâ€™s products â€œsafer and more valuable to people through the use of AIâ€? But he also questioned if the technology was â€œhaving a positive impactâ€? â€œWhen an AI system is optimised to keep us engaged (doom scrolling), is it making our lives better?â€?he said. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Pesenti said he became the primary tutor for his children and saw the â€œimmense, untapped potentialâ€?that AI can bring to education. This prompted him to launch Sizzle AI, which is advertised as a â€œfree AI tutor for everyoneâ€? â€œMy vision was to use what weâ€™ve learned from applying AI algorithms in social media to education to build an appÂ that makes learning personalised, engaging and effective,â€?Pesenti said. Sizzle AI launched last August and has reached 100,000 weekly active users, according to Pesenti. He said the company is working to expand what the app can offer and double its team size in 2024. While education is the main focus for Pesenti these days, he still believes in the power of AI across multiple sectors and said the technology will â€œchange the very way we live, learn, work and playâ€? But he also shared concerns about some of the limitations of AI, noting the â€œaccuracy challengeâ€?that still exists in these systems. While this technology has surged in popularity since the rise of generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, there are plenty of examples where these systems make mistakes that are portrayed as fact. A study last year also claimed that AI can trick people into believing false information better than humans can. â€œHelping billions of users remember AIâ€™s limitations while using it every day has to be top priority,â€?Pesenti said. â€œWe will have even bigger questions about privacy," ethical use of AI requiring new legal frameworks that protect those who need it most while not stifling innovation.â€?The balance between regulation and allowing innovation has been seen in the development of the EUâ€™s AI Act...""",2

Until they started using it. Then, it would be a different story. Also: A look back at 40 Years of GNU and the Free Software Foundation The IBM LinuxONE 4 Express, the newest member of the Rockhopper mainframe family, comes with up to a maximum of 16 Integrated Facility for Linux (IFLs). These Linux-only system boards are powered by a 4.6GHz IBM 8-core Telum processor. This 7nm architecture chip can support as much as 864GB of memory. Storage? It's a rack mount, so you can add pretty much any storage you like.Â  The Telum chip also includes an AI coprocessor. The goal is to enable you to use AI to deal with transactions in close to real-time. For example, IBM claims you can use the Telum chip to catchÂ financial transaction fraud before it can be processed. Color me impressed.Â  The new mainframe is also designed -- when used with IBM's GDPS software and DS8000 series storage with HyperSwap -- to deliver 99.999999% (eight 9s) availability when running Red Hat's be-spoke Kubernetes Â OpenShift Container Platform.Â  Steven Dickens, The Futurum Group VP and practice leader, said: ""With the new LinuxONE 4 Express solution, IBM is uniquely positioned to handle mission-critical workloads with high availability. When you combine this with the system's cybersecurity posture, IBM is well positioned for market traction."" Cybersecurity? The new mini-mainframe comes with IBM Secure Execution for Linux. This is a hardware-based security technology that protects data run in Linux Kernel Virtual Machines (KVM) guests from being viewed or modified by the server environment. With Secure Execution, you can protect individual workloads not only from external attacks but also insider threats. This includes data in use, a particularly critical stage of security for digital assets use cases. Also: Windows security: How to protect your home and small business PCs All these capabilities can be used to run medical imaging applications safely with protected data using AI. For example, health insurance companies could analyze large volumes of medical records in near real-time to validate process claims. You can also use it for such traditional mainframe jobs as workload consolidation: IBM claims that users who move Linux workloads from a comparable x86 server to an IBM LinuxONE 4 Express can save over 52% on their total cost of ownership (TCO) over five years. Moreover, the LinuxONE 4 Express can be used to set up hybrid clouds using Red Hat products. Tina Tarquinio, IBM Z and LinuxONE's VP of product management for IBM Z and LinuxONE, said: ""IBM LinuxONE 4 Express is a chance for startups and small to medium-sized businesses to build an intentional...",3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Study: Discontent in retail experiences signal interest in AI-driven shopping,2024-02-11T12:21:32+00:00,https://newsbytes.ph/2024/02/11/study-discontent-in-retail-experiences-signal-interest-in-ai-driven-shopping/,"As the retail landscape faces mounting pressure from evolving consumer expectations and economic headwinds, a new global study from the IBM Institute for Business Value revealed a widening gap between shopper demands and the current retail offering. The third biennial consumer study, â€œRevolutionize retail with AI everywhere: Customers wonâ€™t wait,â€?surveyed nearly 20,000 global consumers and revealed a dissatisfaction with retail experiences, with only 9% of consumers surveyed saying they are content with in-store and 14% content with online shopping.Â  Yet technology could play an important role in enhancing the overall shopping experience, with over half of the respondents indicating they are eager for AI enhancements like virtual assistants (55%) and AI applications (59%) as they shop. Influenced by inflation, six in ten consumers surveyed also say inflation has impacted how they shop, with 62% saying that price is a top reason they switch stores or brands. â€œIn the face of rapidly shifting consumer expectations and the stark realities of todayâ€™s economic picture for households, the retail sector is presented with an ongoing challenge â€?and an unprecedented opportunity,â€?said Luq Niazi, global managing director at IBM. â€œWe are seeing that todayâ€™s consumers, faced with more choices and channels than ever, are increasingly making their purchasing decisions based on the cost and the quality of experiences that retailers provide. â€œThe IBM IBV Consumer 2024 Study underscores an opportunity for retailers to integrate AI and other technologies into both digital and physical shopping experiences to meet these changing consumer demands and their economic challenges. â€œLeveraging advances in AI technologies, retailers can forge ahead into a new era of commerce and fulfilment, leading with innovation to create shopping experiences that are as intuitive, unified, personalized and efficient.â€?Noteworthy findings from the study include: Â© Newsbytes.PH.

Tech layoffs in 2024: A timeline,2024-02-23T10:41:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3685936/tech-layoffs-in-2023-a-timeline.html#tk.rss_all,"
				Technology companies have continued to lay off staff in 2024, despite improving fundamentals. Here's an updated timeline of notable layoffs, and reasons why Big Tech is in turmoil.			  After two years of massive layoffs at IT companies, 2024 was expected to be a year of recovery for the IT industry. While there are early signs of that, with global IT spending expected to increase 8% to cross $5.1 trillion in 2024 according to Gartner, jobs continue to be impacted in the sector. Some of the layoffs being seen this year are an extension of job cuts announced in 2023. Last year, tech giants including Amazon, Cisco, Facebook parent company Meta, Microsoft, Google, IBM, SAP, and Salesforceâ€”as well as many smaller companies â€”announced sweeping job cuts. The problem: Big Tech went on a hiring binge during the pandemic when lockdowns sparked a tech buying spree to support remote work and an uptick in e-commerce, and now they face revenue declines. According to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi, the online tracker keeping tabs on job losses in the technology sector, 1,186 tech companies laid off about 262,682 staff in 2023, compared to 164,969 layoffs in 2022. In 2024, 168 tech companies have already laid off 42,324 employees. Here is a listâ€”to be updated regularlyâ€”of some of the most prominent technology layoffs the industry has experienced recently. Feb. 14: Cisco cuts 5% of workforce Cisco will shed 4,200 of its 84,900 employees as it refocuses on more profitable areas of its business, including AI and security. The companyâ€™s last major round of layoffs was in November 2022. Ciscoâ€™s sales of telecommunications equipment have been hit by delays at telcos in rolling out equipment they havealready purchased. AI, on the other hand, is a growing business for Cisco, with AI-related sales in the billionsâ€”and thatâ€™s before it announcedÂ its recent partnership with Nvidia, which is making bank on sales of chips for AI applications.Â  Feb. 6 DocuSign will lay off 6% of workforce in restructuring Digital workflow company DocuSign will lay off 440 of its 7,336 staff as it seeks to cut costs. The lay-offs come amid reports that attempts to sell the company to investment firms have fallen apart after a failure to agree on price. Jan. 25: Microsoft axes 1,900 workers in its gaming division Roughly 8% of Microsoftâ€™s Gaming division is headed for unemployment, the company announced Thursday, with the lionâ€™s share of job cuts affecting the newly acquired Activision Blizzard subsidiary. Microsoft completed its purchase of Activision Blizzard in October 2023, paying nearly $69 billion. About 1,900 employees will be let go, along with two executives at Blizzard: Mike Ybarra and Allen Adham. A pending survival game title, according to Reuters, has also been cancelled. The layoffs were largely expected in the wake of the Microsoft acquisition.

"The old, not the new: Basic security issues still biggest threat to enterprises",2024-02-23T06:00:21+00:00,https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/23/2024-x-force-threat-intelligence-index/,"In 2023, cybercriminals saw more opportunities to â€œlog inâ€?versus hack into corporate networks through valid accounts â€?making this tactic a preferred weapon for threat actors, according to IBMâ€™s 2024 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index.  In nearly 85% of attacks on critical sectors, compromise could have been mitigated with patching, MFA, or least-privilege principals â€?indicating that what the security industry historically described as â€œbasic securityâ€?may be harder to achieve than portrayed. Ransomware attacks on enterprises saw a nearly 12% drop last year, as larger organizations opt against paying and decrypting, in favor of rebuilding their infrastructure. With this growing pushback likely to impact adversariesâ€?revenue expectations from encryption-based extortion, groups that previously specialized in ransomware were observed pivoting to infostealers. X-Force analysis projects that when a single generative AI technology approaches 50% market share or when the market consolidates to three or less technologies, it could trigger at-scale attacks against these platforms. â€œWhile â€˜security fundamentalsâ€?doesnâ€™t get as many head turns as â€˜AI-engineered attacks,â€?it remains that enterprisesâ€?biggest security problem boils down to the basic and known â€?not the novel and unknownâ€?said Charles Henderson, Global Managing Partner, IBM Consulting, and Head of IBM X-Force. â€œIdentity is being used against enterprises time and time again, a problem that will worsen as adversaries invest in AI to optimize the tactic.â€?Exploiting valid accounts has become the path of least resistance for cybercriminals, with billions of compromised credentials accessible on the dark web today. In 2023, X-Force saw attackers increasingly invest in operations to obtain usersâ€?identities â€?with a 266% uptick in infostealing malware, designed to steal personal identifiable information like emails, social media and messaging app credentials, banking details, crypto wallet data and more. This â€œeasy entryâ€?for attackers is one thatâ€™s harder to detect, eliciting a costly response from enterprises. According to X-Force, major incidents caused by attackers using valid accounts were associated to nearly 200% more complex response measures by security teams than the average incident â€?with defenders needing to distinguish between legitimate and malicious user activity on the network.  In fact, IBMâ€™s 2023 Cost of a Data Breach Report found that breaches caused by stolen or compromised credentials required roughly 11 months to detect and recover from â€?the longest response lifecycle than any other infection vector. This wide reach into usersâ€?online activity was evident in the FBI and European law enforcementâ€™s April 2023 takedown of a global cybercrime forum that collected the login details of more than 80 million user accounts. Identity-based threats will likely continue to grow as adversaries leverage generative AI to optimize their attacks. Already in 2023, X-Force observed over 800,00...",-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Abuse of valid accounts by threat actors hits a high, says IBM",2024-02-21T19:56:06+00:00,https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/abuse-of-valid-accounts-by-threat-actors-hits-a-high-says-ibm/559157,"VideosÂ PodcastsBlogsSlideshows For years, cybersecurity experts have been warning organizations of the importance of identity and access management processes â€?including password management and protection against compromise of multifactor authentication â€?to secure IT assets. A new report from IBM, released Wednesday, suggests failure to do that is increasingly costing firms badly. Abusing valid accounts was in a three-way tie as the most common way threat actors entered organizationsâ€?IT environments in incidents that IBMâ€™s X-Force intelligence service investigated in 2023. It represented 30 per cent of initial entry vectors for incidents studied, tying with phishing. Exploiting public-facing applications was right up there, with 29 per cent of incidents. The position of abusing valid accounts is even more notable because it was quite a jump over 2022â€™s report, when it was the initial access vector of 16 per cent of incidents looked at that year. Attackers have a historical inclination to choose the path of least resistance in pursuit of their objectives, says the report. â€œIn this era, the focus has shifted towards logging in rather than hacking in, highlighting the relative ease of acquiring credentials compared to exploiting vulnerabilities or executing phishing campaigns,â€?it noted. â€œAs defenders increase their detection and prevention capabilities, attackers are finding that obtaining valid credentials is an easier route to achieving their goals, considering the alarming volume of compromised yet valid credentials availableâ€”and easily accessibleâ€”on the dark web.â€?Researchers found that cloud account credentials alone make up 90 per cent of cloud assets for sale on the dark web. That, the report says, makes it easy for threat actors to take over legitimate user identities to establish access into IT environments. Attacker use of valid accounts as an initial access vector appears to have a significant impact on the required response efforts as well, the report adds. Another related significant finding: A 100 per cent increase in â€œKerberoasting.â€?Itâ€™s a technique focused on compromising Microsoft Windows Active Directory credentials through Kerberos tickets. This indicates a technique shift in how attackers are acquiring identities to carry out their operations, the report notes. Perhaps no coincidence, researchers saw a 266 per cent increase in the use of information stealers â€?which steal credentials as well as other computer information â€?by threat actors last year. In nearly 85 per cent of incidents on critical infrastructure that X-Force responded to, the initial access vector could have been mitigated with best practices and security fundamentals, such as asset and patch management, credential hardening, and the principle of least privilege. Among Canadian data pulled from the numbers gathered by IBM, half of attacks here were against the government sector.

 Researchers reveal a 266 percent increase in info-stealing malware as threat actors shift tactics.  Executive Editor 
	While AI-engineered cyberattacks may grab all the headlines, exploiting valid accounts has gained steam as cybercriminals double down on cracking into businesses worldwide, according to researchers at IBM X-Force, the tech giantsâ€?security division. 
	In its 2024 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index report, IBM said, â€œcybercriminals saw more opportunities to â€˜log inâ€?versus hack into corporate networks through valid accounts â€?making this tactic a preferred weapon of choice for threat actors.â€?

"Europe bears the brunt of cyberattacks, IBM claims",2024-02-21T14:56:50+00:00,https://www.siliconrepublic.com/enterprise/europe-cyberattacks-2023-ibm-critical-infrastructure,"
by Leigh Mc Gowran
 
21 Feb 2024  Image: IBM/Gorodenkoff Productions OU The IBM X-Force report warned that more cybercriminals are using stolen credentials to attack their victims, while critical infrastructure attacks are on the rise. Cybercriminals continue to evolve their tactics and their targets, as Europe faced the majority of cyberattacks last year. Thatâ€™s according to a new report by IBMâ€™s X-Force, which claimed that 32pc of all global cyberattacks occurred in Europe in 2023. This region also experienced the most ransomware attacks, with 26pc of these attacks taking place in the region. This marks a change from 2022 and 2021, which saw the Asia-Pacific region hold the top spot as the most impacted region, followed by Europe. The UK was the most attacked country in Europe last year, accounting for 27pc of cases according to X-Force. The organisationâ€™s ThreatIntelligence Index 2024Â is based on observations from monitoring more than 150bn security events each day in more than 130 countries. The report claimed that a global identity crisis is brewing, as more cybercriminals are using stolen credentials to log in to victim networks using compromised accounts â€?instead of having to hack into a network. There was a 71pc increase last year in the number of cyberattacks that used stolen or compromised credentials, suggesting this is becoming a preferred method for many threat actors. Attacks that use this method are trickier to detect and can be more costly for enterprises, requiring more complex response measures by security teams than average cybersecurity incidents. The report also found that the number of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure grew substantially last year, representing 70pc of the total attacks that X-Force responded to in 2023. This suggests that cybercriminals are wagering on high-value targets and their need to stay online. Critical infrastructure has been a prime target for cyberattacks for years, but the latest report suggests many organisations in critical sectors are not keeping their security ready for this challenge. The X-Force report claims that in nearly 85pc of attacks on critical sectors, compromises could have been mitigated with patching, multifactor authentication or by using â€œleast-privilege principalsâ€? Earlier this month, a coalition of US intelligence agencies claimed that Volt Typhoon, a group of hackers allegedly backed by China, has had access to critical US infrastructure for at least five years. Meanwhile, the report claims that ransomware attacks on enterprises dropped by nearly 12pc in 2023, which X-Force attributed to larger organisations opting to rebuild their infrastructure instead of paying ransoms for decryption keys. The report claimed cybercriminal groups that previously specialised in ransomware were observed pivoting to become infostealers â€?which use malware to steal sensitive information such as log-in credentials and personal data. The report also warned about the risk generative AI c...",-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2024 Call for Code aims to harness gen AI to improve equality,2024-03-01T14:04:43+00:00,https://betanews.com/2024/03/01/2024-call-for-code-aims-to-harness-gen-ai-to-improve-equality/,"This week IBM, along with charitable partner United Nations Human Rights, and program affiliate the Linux Foundation, launches its 2024 Call for Code Global Challenge with the aim of encouraging developers to use generative AI technology to create solutions that improve equitable access to resources and opportunities for historically underserved and vulnerable people. Participants will have access to a trial version of watsonx, IBM's AI and data platform with AI Assistants, as well as IBM Cloud technology and developer-friendly training and resources to help teams develop their solutions. ""Necessities like clean water, safe affordable housing, and opportunities in education and fair government representation are not equally available to all people. Climate change exacerbates these challenges in underserved communitiesâ€?whose resources are often strained and inadequate,"" says David Clark, founder and CEO of Call for Code. ""With generative AI technology like watsonx, the developer community has a powerful tool to help tackle these issues, in order to help reduce inequality and improve peopleâ€™s lives around the world."" Using a trial version of IBM watsonx, which is designed with principles of transparency, responsibility and governance, and IBM's hybrid cloud platform, developers will produce solutions to help address equitable access issues in areas such as effective climate change policies and protections; affordable and clean energy; clean water and awareness of water quality; leadership and income opportunities; safe and affordable housing; representation; technology; and quality education. ""What makes Call for Code such a dynamic developer challenge is its ability to rally and inspire students, developers, and problem-solvers from universities and companies around the world to use AI and other technology to help address some of societyâ€™s most pressing issues,"" says Savio Rodrigues, vice president, ecosystem engineering and developer advocacy at IBM. ""This year, participants can build with IBM watsonx to help power their solutions, and will also have access to IBM mentors and free courses in generative AI, to help ensure they are able to create the most impactful submissions."" The 2024 challenge will feature a single round, which opens on March 8th with submissions due by October 17th. A Grand Prize winner will be awarded $50,000 and solution implementation support from the Call for Code ecosystem. The first runner-up will win $25,000 and the second runner-up will receive $10,000. Universities around the world are helping promote Call for Code in the classroom and are working to support and co-host Call for Code events throughout the year. The top-scoring team comprised entirely of university students will also earn a $30,000 grant to be awarded to their school or shared by up to five schools represented by the team members.

Report: Manufacturing top target for cyberattacks in Asia Pacific,2024-03-01T08:45:50+00:00,https://newsbytes.ph/2024/03/01/report-manufacturing-top-target-for-cyberattacks-in-asia-pacific/,"Tech titan IBM has released the 2024 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, revealing the manufacturing sector as the most-targeted industry in Asia-Pacific for the second year in a row, accounting for 46% of the incidents. While Europe accounted for most attacks on the transportation industry globally in the previous year, Asia Pacific surpassed it in 2023 as it experienced 63% of attacks against transportation entities. Notably, the study also showed how Asia-Pacific was the third most-targeted geography in 2023, accounting for 23% of incidents responded to globally. According to IBM X-Force, IBM Consultingâ€™s offensive and defensive security services arm, phishing and exploitation of public-facing applications were the most common initial access vectors observed in the region for 2023. However, amid the spike of identity-based attacks that emerged globally, organizations in the region should practice vigilance and focus on strengthening their user access controls as cybercriminals see more opportunities to â€œlog inâ€?versus hacking into corporate networks through valid accounts. The X-Force Threat Intelligence Index is based on insights and observations from monitoring over 150 billion security events per day in more than 130 countries. Some other key findings in Asia-Pacific region include: â€œAlthough â€˜AI-engineered attacksâ€?are receiving more attention due to the rise of generative AI in the current landscape, the biggest security threat in Asia Pacific remains to be known unpatched vulnerabilities. Additional focus should also be placed on the regionâ€™s critical infrastructure and key industries such as manufacturing, finance and insurance, and transportation, with stress tests and well-prepared incidents response plans in place,â€?said Catherine Lian, general manager and technology leader at IBM Asean. â€œThe exploitation of user identity is becoming a preferred weapon of choice for global threat actors, raising the need for more effective user access control strategies in the region, and is prompting us to promote a holistic approach to security in the age of generative AI.â€?Â© Newsbytes.PH.

Phishing, ransomware and other cyberattacks put businesses of every size at huge risk of losing millions of dollars trying to remedy the situation. In fact, according to IBM, the global average cost of a data breach in 2023 was $4.45 million â€?a 15% increase over three years. This kind of cost is unfathomable for many businesses â€?especially small to mid-sized enterprises, who simply cannot afford to pay out such a vast sum. To help customers mitigate risk and avoid the rising costs of security threats, Thrive has introduced its latest cybersecurity offering: Thrive Incident Response & Remediation. With this solution, customers are connected to a dedicated Incident Responder from the Thrive Security Operations Center (SOC) in the event of a security incident to access the incidentâ€™s scope and provide immediate response actions to restore services.  Thrive Incident Response & Remediation proactively gets ahead of cybersecurity threats by collaborating on pre-incident planning and running an automated compromise assessment that will hunt for threats already in the environment. Should an incident occur, customers using the service will see faster recovery time after a cybersecurity incident, keeping business disruption and the costs associated to a minimum.

Vice Chairman of IBM on inflation and 2024 election,2024-03-11T20:28:58+00:00,https://kyma.com/decision-2024/national-politics/2024/03/11/vice-chairman-of-ibm-on-inflation-and-2024-election/,"WASHINGTON, D.C. (CBS, KYMA/KECY) - IBM Vice Chairman Gary Cohn, who served as an economic adviser in the Trump administration, appeared on Face the Nation Sunday, speaking to moderator Margaret Brennan about inflation. ""I think it's a really important concept for everyone to understand. Inflation has a compounding effect, meaning as you look at inflation, year over year, you're adding up those numbers. You're not starting at zero every year. So if we had 6% inflation last year, 7% inflation, and now we have 4% inflation, that's 10% inflation. So if you take a basket of groceries at the beginning of 2020, just a simple basic basket that cost $100, it costs well over $125 today, because those 4% one year and 7% one year and 7% the next year, they add up, they're cumulative. So there's a huge cumulative effect, inflation."" During the interview with Brennan, Cohn said that right now, ""the business community, at this point, is still open minded"" about whether to support President Biden or former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election. ""I think the business community really wants to hear the policies. You know, there's a lot of big policies out here...we touched on taxes. You know, what's going to happen in taxes by the end of end of '25, where are we going to be...that's very important. Energy policy, very important to business. Business consumes a lot of energy. We haven't even talked on AI. AI is a huge consumer of electricity, it's going to change our demand profile dramatically in this country. The southern border, what's gonna go on at the southern border. Legal immigration, we need skilled laborers in this country, we need to bring in two million skilled laborers in this country. The business community is going to look at those topics and they're going to look at the platforms of the candidates. And I think that's going to have a huge impact on how they vote.""

IBM said it was using Adobeâ€™s tools, which can generate images from text-based prompts, to help with marketing campaigns. It is an early test of Adobeâ€™s strategy to create AI systems trained on its own proprietary data with legal guarantees against lawsuits, a strategy that Adobe hopes will lure in large businesses. Billy Seabrook, the global chief design officer for IBMâ€™s consulting arm, said that the 1,600 designers in his unit used Adobeâ€™s tools to help generate ideas quickly and create variants of them to be used in different parts of marketing campaigns. â€œWhat typically would take us two weeks for an end-to-end cycle, weâ€™ve gotten down to two days,â€?Seabrook told Reuters. Overall IBM said it expects a 10-fold increase in the productivity of designers, who will be able to devote more time to brainstorming and creating storyboards instead of generating minor design variants. Seabrook said that in the short term, the most likely impact to design industry employment from use of the new tools will be to use existing teams to do more work. â€œThereâ€™s typically a rule of prioritization of what big bets you are going to go after and what staff youâ€™re going to put towards a problem. Theoretically, youâ€™re opening up more headroom to focus on some of those other problems,â€?he said. The long term impact on employment is less clear. Seabrook said recent IBM survey data showed most business leaders think designers are more important than ever. â€œThey have to be almost the tastemakers and the quality checkers of the output of the generative AI, as well as a little bit of the empathy in the room that helps train and fine-tune and curate that AI,â€?Seabrook said. But in other parts of the survey data, â€œeveryone agrees there are going to be fewer jobs,â€?Seabrook said. â€œWeâ€™re waiting to see what happens.â€?Sign up to the Cyprus Mail Newsletter We are using cookies to give you the best experience on our website.

Now, as AI emerges as one of the most transformative technologies of our era, projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to global GDP by 2030, IBMâ€™s role in shaping this landscape becomes even more significant. As interest in AI surges in South Africa, IBMâ€™s insights into overcoming barriers to AI adoption, addressing ethics and governance concerns as well as bridging the AI skills gap are invaluable.

With 46% recognizing productivity or profitability as key to achieving their business goals. Further, 75% of CEOs globally believe their organizationâ€™s competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI. However, while the enthusiasm for AI and generative AI is evident, local organizations still face numerous barriers in their race to modernize and adopt the technology. In a recent discussion, we had the privilege of exploring IBMâ€™s viewpoint on artificial intelligence (AI) and its significant impact across different sectors worldwide.

How IBM is using Adobe Firefly to reshape design,2024-03-07T11:00:00+00:00,https://www.computerworld.com/article/3714200/how-ibm-is-using-adobe-firefly-to-reshape-design.html#tk.rss_all,"
				IBM Chief Design Officer Billy Seabrook talked about the company's use of Adobe's generative AI tool Firefly and how it boosted  productivity for design staffers.			  With the rollout of Adobe Firefly last year, IBM made generative AI (genAI) image creation available to thousands of designers. It didnâ€™t take long for the tool to make an impression, said Billy Seabrook, global chief design officer for IBMâ€™s consulting arm. Firefly was used, for example, to create 200 visual assets for IBMâ€™s â€œLetâ€™s Createâ€?marketing campaign last year that involved rendering an image of a question mark in a variety of textures and colors. Firefly generated many variations â€?from a question mark made of flower petal to one made of chain link â€?that designers could choose to then edit and refine into a final product. With the tools, what could have been a lengthy process taking months was dramatically sped up. â€œVery little resource was needed, it was done really quickly, and, funnily enough, it was one of â€?if not theÂ â€?most high-performing marketing campaign of recent time,â€?said Seabrook. â€œIt did exceptionally well.â€?IBM used Adobe FireflyÂ for a campaign to create images of a question mark in a variety of textures and colors. The use of Adobe for the external marketing campaign was a one-off, said Seabrook, but the aim is to do the same thing on similar projects as the genAI software matures. Beyond the assets created, the company hopes to useÂ Firefly to automate design tasks and, ultimately, increase productivity. Â  â€œThe biggest challenge I think everybody faces in the industry right now is delivering really great experiences and really high-quality content with more efficiency, and [at a] faster pace,â€?said Seabrook. He cited the adage â€?â€œfaster, better, cheaper: pick twoâ€?â€?and said: â€œWe really are under the pressure, like everybody in the world, to deliver all three: great content, faster and cheaper.â€?Billy Seabrook, global chief design officer for IBMâ€™s consulting arm. Having previously held senior positions at Citi and eBay, Seabrook now leads design for IBMâ€™s consulting arm, where heâ€™s responsible for a team that includes 1,600 or so designers that focus on content design, visual UX, and more. Thatâ€™s just one part of IBMâ€™s overall design workforce, with more than 3,500 designers across the organization. IBM is a long-time Adobe customer and partner, providing consulting services to clients about using tools such as Firefly, making it a natural early adopter of the technology in-house. IBMâ€™s Firefly deployment began with a pilot when Adobe made the product available in beta. Since then, after the generalÂ launch last September, the tool has been rolled out Â to roughly 20,000 IBM staffers with Adobe Creative Cloud licenses. That gives them Â access to Firefly in Adobe apps such as Photoshop and Express, though details on employee uptake were unavailable. Aside from creating visual assets for the customer-facing â€œLetâ€™s Createâ€?campaign, Firefly has been use...",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Major shifts in identity, ransomware, and critical infrastructure threat trends",2024-03-07T05:00:10+00:00,https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/03/07/2024-x-force-threat-intelligence-index-video/," In this Help Net Security video, Michelle Alvarez, Strategic Threat Analysis Manager at IBM X-Force, discusses the 2024 X-Force Threat Intelligence Index, revealing top threats and trends the team observed last year across its global engagements and how these shifts are forming the threat landscape in 2024 and beyond. X-Force observed shifts toward credential-driven attacks with a 71% increase in attacks caused by using valid accounts. As cybercriminals see more opportunities to â€œlog inâ€?vs. hack in, phishing attacks saw a 44% decrease in volume from 2022. X-Force observed a 12% drop in ransomware attacks on enterprises, signaling a business model shift by operators who were seen pivoting to infostealer malware (which saw a 266% surge) as businesses opt to rebuild vs. paying ransom to decrypt. Ransomwareâ€™s â€œpressureâ€?to adapt is also a result of law enforcement takedowns (most recently LockBit) that continue to disrupt these operations. Nearly 70% of attacks targeted critical infrastructure in 2023, reaffirming these sectorsâ€?position as high-value targets to cybercriminals. About 85% of attacks on these sectors couldâ€™ve been mitigated with security fundamentals. X-Force analysis suggests there is a lack of incentives by threat actors to invest in attacking the genAI models themselves. Per the report, when a single generative AI technology approaches 50% market share or when the market consolidates to three or fewer technologies, it will trigger at-scale attacks against these platforms that can yield ROI.",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IBM points finger at DOE contract as reason for NYC remote school system fail,2024-03-07T00:51:49+00:00,https://nypost.com/2024/03/06/us-news/ibm-points-finger-at-doe-contract-as-reason-for-remote-schooling-failure/,"
		Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.	 IBM pointed the finger Wednesday at the city Department of Education for the remote learning system failure that left parents, students and teachers outraged and frustrated during last monthâ€™s snowstorm. Officials for the tech company said its contract with the DOE didnâ€™t cover the bandwidth required to withstand the public school systemâ€™s more than 900,000 students and their teachers logging on at the same time. â€œIt was not a failure of IBM technology,â€?IBM senior State Executive for New York Vanessa Hunt said, adding it would be a â€œdisservice to not identify the root cause of this event.â€?The revelation came during a City Council hearing about the system failure that took place when the department insisted on going remote the day of the February storm. â€œThe departmentâ€™s use of ISV (IBM Security verify) was simply not contracted to support the nearly one million students and their teachers logging in at the same time,â€?Hunt told lawmakers, referring to the tech DOE uses as its remote login and identity management system. The hearing followed weeks of finger-pointing over the fiasco, including Schools Chancellor David Banksâ€?claims that â€œIBM was not ready for primetime.â€?â€œOur contract which was signed in 2019 established a simultaneous use threshold of 400 transactions per second â€?thatâ€™s simply a gauge of how many users can log in at any given time,â€?Hunt revealed. â€œIBM has on multiple occasions increased the capacity of this system, far beyond the contracted levels at no added cost to the DOE to meet the school systemâ€™s evolving needs,â€?she added. Hunt stressed that IBM has made recommendations to the DOE to amend their current contract â€?but in the meantime is also working with the department to find immediate solutions.  â€œI think that if we are going to plan for additional remote learning days where that is the plan, then absolutely not 400 TPS is not adequate. And we would need to move to that auto scaling solution,â€?she said. DOE Deputy Chief Information Officer ScottÂ Strickland echoed Huntâ€™s statement, saying: â€œThe immediate term plan includes the possibility of staggering start times on remote learning day to distribute the peak load on the IBM user authentication service.â€?Strickland defended the DOEâ€™s decision not to conduct widespread testing before the remote learning day. â€œIn the past while we had superintendents test in all of their districts, we did not conduct a load test where all students and staff attempted to log in at the same time,â€?he said. â€œThis would have been a substantial undertaking that would have disrupted school and or families and staff time at home. That for more testing is also not an industry standard in terms of performance testing.â€?About 100,000 were able to log in before 8am. Meanwhile, between 15,000 and 40,000 users were able to log in every 10 minutes from 8am till 10am totalling more than 660,000 users. â€œBy the end of the day, over one million...",-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The federal government has announced an investment of over C$1.9 million to connect 152 Indigenous households in WhatÃ¬, a community in the Northwest Territories (NWT). The investment will go to Northwestel, which will be undertaking the project. Owned by Bell, Northwestel is an incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) and long-distance carrier in the territories of Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and part of Northern British Columbia. Another C$480,000 went to SSI Micro, a Yellowknife-based telco that provides cellular access to a repositionable communications shelter, located in hunting and fishing grounds near Fort Providence. â€œConnectivity is an essential tool to access education and health care and to grow a business,â€?said Gudie Hutchings, minister of rural economic development. â€œIt also improves safety and provides peace of mind. Your government is on track to exceed its historic commitment to connect 98 per cent of Canadians to high-speed Internet by 2026.â€?The investments are provided through the Universal Broadband Fund, which seeks to ensure that Canadians in rural, remote, and Indigenous communities have access to reliable internet and mobile connectivity.  Web hosting company GoDaddy announced that it has launched GoDaddy Airo, an AI-powered solution designed to help small business owners save time and attract new customers, in Canada and the U.S.. The tool will, for instance, recommend catchy domain name options, generate logo designs, create a fully built website, a professional email account, product descriptions, email marketing campaigns, a social media calendar and more. This announcement comes as GoDaddy released a survey of 500 Canadian small business owners revealing that only one in five of them used generative AI for business-related tasks, despite expectations that AI will reduce costs and hours worked. The average Canadian small business owner, in fact, estimates that generative AI tools could save them $2,600 and around 260 hours per year, while one in four believes the technology can reduce their workload by 500 hours or more annually. However, half of the surveyed respondents admit they donâ€™t know how to start using generative AI. â€œThatâ€™s about to change,â€?asserted Young Lee, head of GoDaddy Canada.  eCampus Ontario, a Toronto-based non profit organization that aims to strengthen Ontarioâ€™s post secondary education system through online learning, has launched SkillsFinder.ai, a custom GPT, powered by OpenAI to to help learners better understand their skills gaps and find a micro-credential to fill these gaps.

Corp. of P35.35 million in tax liabilities, as it ruled the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) had failed to issue a valid formal assessment notice (FAN) in 2015. The tax agencyâ€™s assessment notice suffered from â€œincurable defectâ€?because it did not specify the amount of the tax and when it was due, the tax courtâ€™s Special Third Division said in a 20-page decision promulgated on March 15.Â  â€œWithout a valid formal assessment notice, the assessment that sprung from it is inescapably void,â€?Associate Justice Corazon Ferrer-Flores said in the ruling. Also, the court ruled that the petitioner is not liable to pay the subject compromise penalties. â€œSince the subject assessments are void, petitioner cannot likewise be held liable to the compromise penalty in the amount of P70,000,â€?it said. â€?Chloe Mari A.

IBM Eyes First Record Since 2013 As AI Optimism Fuels 19% Rally,2024-03-20T12:31:48+00:00,https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/ibm-eyes-first-record-since-2013-as-ai-optimism-fuels-19-rally,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the oldest companies in tech has been quietly trouncing some of the hottest stocks on Wall Street. International Business Machines Corp. recently hit its highest since 2013, putting it about 6% below an all-time high as investors bet that a turnaround is finally bearing fruit after years of tepid growth and share-price returns. Compared to the Magnificent Seven, IBMâ€™s 19% gain this year, including dividends, trails only Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.Â  â€œIBM has been discounted by the rest of the industry, but it has made a lot of investments in both cloud and AI, and with a strong AI business, we could see growth inflecting higher,â€?said Jethro Townsend, portfolio manager at Nia Impact Capital. He cites the firmâ€™s cash flow generation and â€œhealthyâ€?dividend yield as factors that provide room for it to re-rate higher.Â  Much of the yearâ€™s advance followed IBMâ€™s results in late January, when it gave a better-than-expected forecast for both free cash flow and revenue and said it was seeing growing demand for its AI products. The company has also cut jobs and expects to pause hiring for roles that could be replaced with AI, which is seen as a potential tailwind for margins.Â  The stockâ€™s surge is a recent phenomenon, however; while Apple Inc. has lagged this year, its five-year total return of 275% is much stronger than IBMâ€™s 82% gain over the same period. Wall Street remains divided, with bulls outnumbered by skeptics and bears, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While it looks cheaper relative to most big-tech stocks, IBMâ€™s multiple of 19 times estimated earnings is near its highest in 20 years. Furthermore, the stock is 4% over the average price target, among the worst return potentials among components of the S&P 500 tech index. Still, the company offers something that is something of a rarity among big tech: a robust dividend. The indicated yield is 3.43%, well above others in the sector. The indicated yields for Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are below 1%, and while Nvidia pays a dividend, the yield is essentially non-existent. That hasnâ€™t been enough to entice bulls in the face of IBMâ€™s growth potential, which is expected to remain far below the megacaps. Revenue is expected to grow at a single-digit pace for the next several years, compared with double-digit expansion for other AI-adjacent companies like Microsoft or Alphabet Inc. Its most recent report failed to juice expectations; while the consensus for the companyâ€™s net 2024 earnings is up 4.4% over the past quarter, the view for revenue has barely budged, per data compiled by Bloomberg.Â  â€œThe CEO has done a heroic job in starting to turn the company around, but it is just generally slower growth, and not cheap enough to be enticing relative to those more modest prospects,â€?said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors. â€œWe can easily do better elsewhere.â€?Tech Chart of the Day In a measure of how tech continues to be driven by its bigge...",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 In the early morning hours of March 16, 1991, Reba McEntire was awoken to the tragic news that seven members of her band and crew had died in a plane crash following their private performance for IBM executives in San Diego, California. After the performance, McEntire decided to remain in California with her then-husband Narvel Blackstock and stylist to rest and recover from bronchitis. McEntire planned to fly out the following day, while the rest of her crew headed toward Fort Wayne, Indiana, where they were all scheduled to perform the next day.Onboard the twin-engine Hawker Siddeley were musicians Joey Cigainero,Â Paula Evans, Chris Austin,Â Kirk Cappello, Terry Jackson, Anthony Saputo, Michael Thomas, and McEntireâ€™s longtime tour manager Jim Hammon, along with pilot Donald Holms and co-pilot Chris Hollinger. The flight was headed en route to Amarillo, Texas to refuel before its final destination. Just minutes after the plane took off, before 2 a.m., all perished when the aircraft crashed into Otay Mountain, located 33 miles southeast of San Diego at the U.S.-Mexico border.  [RELATED: 4 Songs You Didnâ€™t Know Reba McEntire Wrote Solo] After the tragic event, McEntire considered leaving the music business for good. At one point, Dolly Parton and Vince GillÂ offered McEntire their bands to complete her Rumor Has It Tour, but she chose not to. â€œI didnâ€™t know if I was going to be able to continue,â€?revealed McEntire in 2022.Â â€œBut it showed me how precious life is, and by the grace of God and my faith, I realized that they went on to a better place.â€?A post shared by Reba (@reba) Instead of quitting music, McEntire channeled her grief back to music and released her 18th album, For My Broken Heart later that year. Co-produced by McEntire and Tony Brown, and dedicated to her lost crew, the album, which included the No. 1 hits â€œFor My Broken Heart,â€?Â â€œIs There Life Out Thereâ€Â?and â€œThe Greatest Man I Never Knew,â€Â topped the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, and peaked at No. 13 on the 200. McEntire credited Kenny Rogers, who died in 2020, with having â€œsaved my sanityâ€?by asking her to star with him in the 1991 film The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw. â€œFrom that I learned that you need to take it one day at a time and be very grateful for the things that you have,â€?said McEntire â€œTell folks in your life how much you love and appreciate them.â€Each year, McEntire always thinks of Hammon and her band members and honors their memory. On the 25th anniversary of the crash, McEntire revealed that she took a specialÂ trip to San Diego and flew over the crash site in a helicopter.â€œThirty-three years today since Heaven gained some great angels,â€?shared McEntire in a 2024 social media post. â€œRest in peace, my friends.â€?Photo: Terry Wyatt/WireImage See more

The State of Open Source Security in the Software Supply Chain,2024-03-13T21:11:01+00:00,https://www.webpronews.com/the-state-of-open-source-security-in-the-software-supply-chain/,"Arnaud Le Hors, a Senior Technical Staff Member at IBM and esteemed Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) member delves into the intricate world of open source security, providing invaluable insights into the pressing challenges and innovative solutions shaping the industryâ€™s landscape. With a wealth of experience and expertise spanning the realms of technology and cybersecurity, Arnaud is a beacon of knowledge in an increasingly complex digital ecosystem. In a video presentation, Arnaud sheds light on the pivotal role of open-source software in modern software development, underscoring its ubiquitous presence across a myriad of applications. â€œOpen source has evolved from being a mere component to a foundational pillar of the software supply chain,â€?Arnaud asserts. However, this meteoric rise is juxtaposed against a surge in cyber threats targeting vulnerabilities within open-source frameworks.  â€œThe exponential growth of open source adoption has inadvertently expanded the attack surface, giving rise to a parallel increase in security vulnerabilities,â€?Arnaud notes, highlighting the alarming trend of vulnerabilities exploited through the software supply chain. As software dependencies increase, so does the imperative for robust security measures. In response to this escalating threat landscape, industry stakeholders have rallied behind collaborative initiatives like the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), of which Arnaud is a distinguished member. â€œOpenSSH serves as a crucible for industry leaders to converge, collaborate, and address security challenges at scale,â€?Arnaud explains. By fostering cross-industry partnerships and knowledge sharing, OpenSSF endeavors to fortify the defenses of open-source software against emerging threats. Moreover, regulatory interventions, such as the US executive order mandating software bill of materials (SBOM), have catalyzed efforts to enhance transparency and accountability in the software supply chain. â€œSBOM provides a critical framework for assessing and mitigating security risks associated with open source components,â€?Arnaud elaborates. By offering visibility into component provenance and vulnerabilities, SBOM empowers organizations to manage security threats and bolster resilience proactively. Yet, Arnaud underscores that pursuing open-source security transcends regulatory compliance; it requires a holistic approach encompassing best practices, developer education, and innovative tools. Initiatives like the Scorecard project, championed by OpenSSF, equip stakeholders with the means to evaluate open-source projectsâ€?security posture comprehensively. By fostering a culture of accountability and transparency, these initiatives pave the way for a more resilient open-source ecosystem. Among the pioneering solutions driving the industry forward is the Six Store project, designed to streamline the signing and verification of software artifacts.

Majority of executives plan to invest more in gen AI for sustainability: IBM study,2024-03-26T15:36:17+00:00,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/majority-of-executives-plan-to-invest-more-in-gen-ai-for-sustainability-ibm-study-886700," New Delhi, Mar 26 (PTI) Nearly two-thirds of top executives surveyed believe that generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be important in their sustainability efforts while 76 per cent of executives plan to increase their investment in this emerging technology for sustainability, a study by IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) said. Generative AI can be a game changer for data-driven sustainability, enabling organisations to turn trade-offs into win-wins, identify improvement opportunities, and drive innovation at speed and scale, the study said. While 63 per cent of executives surveyed agree that generative AI will be important for their sustainability efforts, 76 per cent say they plan to increase their investment in generative AI for sustainability. ""With AI reshaping industries, integrating sustainability into core business practices add to the long-term value creation.

Based on a survey of 5,000 C-suite executives across 22 industries and 22 countries including US, UK, and Japan, the study, Beyond Checking the Box, said if organisations flip the way they operationalise sustainability, they can significantly increase business value. The key is to embed sustainability throughout the business, truly bake it into operations, rather than treat it as an add-on, it said. Organisations that embed sustainability spend slightly less on dedicated sustainability efforts as a share of their revenue compared to organisations that donâ€™t embed. ""Organisations in India that embed sustainability are 41 per cent more likely to attribute great improvement in revenue from their sustainability efforts and are 90 per cent more likely to outperform their peers on profitability"".

Cybersecurity Threats In International Relations: Are We Prepared For A Digital Pearl Harbor? â€?OpEd,2024-03-25T16:00:55+00:00,https://api.follow.it/track-rss-story-click/v3/Qw9d99ManWfR9axDL8CK1oMOI2eu70Rg,"
A Journal of Analysis and News   By Meherab Hossain and Md. Obaidullah  The digital revolution has intertwined our world, fueling extraordinary progress but also giving rise to an unprecedented era of interconnected vulnerability. Cybersecurity threats now transcend borders, escalating with alarming speed and posing dangers that could paralyze entire nations. A 2021 report by Cybersecurity Ventures projects that global cybercrime costs will reach a staggering $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. This represents a significant jump from $6 trillion in 2021, highlighting the rapid escalation of the threat. A 2022 report by IBM Security X-Force found that organizations experienced an average of 270 cyberattacks per year in 2021. This translates to roughly one attack every business day. As tensions flare in cyberspace, the specter of a â€œDigital Pearl Harborâ€?forces us to ask: are we truly prepared for this new type of catastrophic attack? These statistics paint a stark picture of the cyber threat landscape. The potential for a large-scale, coordinated attack â€?a â€œDigital Pearl Harborâ€?â€?is no longer a hypothetical scenario. Cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure pose a significant threat to essential systems like power grids, financial markets, transportation networks, and healthcare. These attacks can lead to physical damage, business interruption, and even endanger lives. Recent incidents, such as the Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack and global assaults like NotPetya, highlight the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyber threats.  The interconnected nature of critical infrastructure systems increases the risk of devastating chain reactions if one system fails. The energy sector is a primary target for cyber-attacks, but other sectors like transportation, public services, telecommunications, and critical manufacturing are also vulnerable. The majority of attacks on critical infrastructure are ransomware-based, with hacktivists motivated by political or ideological agendas disrupting transportation operations and targeting industries like steel mills and EV charging stations.  The sophistication of these attacks is increasing, with state-sponsored actors and cybercriminals using advanced tactics to compromise industrial control systems. The Department of Homeland Security emphasizes the importance of securing critical infrastructure against cyber threats due to the potential for devastating kinetic and non-kinetic effects. In todayâ€™s world the rise of cyberwarfare has become a concern blurring the boundaries between activities and acts of war. Countries are involved in spying stealing information and creating weapons to disrupt their adversaries. However, tracing the source of cyber-attacks proves to be a challenge highlighting the importance of establishing norms and agreements to regulate this realm. Cyberwarfare has surpassed limits posing challenges in identifying adversaries crafting policies and responding to cyber threats. It entail...",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hereâ€™s how it works. IBM's latest System One quantum computer is based at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and is the 1st IBM quantum machine to be installed at a university campus in the U.S. The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, New York, has unveiled a new campus-based quantum computer that can be used for scientific discovery â€?rather than one that's just used to run proof-of-concept trials. The new IBM System One quantum computer is powered by a processor called ""Eagle"" that has 127 quantum bits, or qubits, IBM representatives said April 5 in a statement. This quantum processing unit (QPU) was first announced in 2021 and debuted in a Â System One machine in November last year that is used by the University of Tokyo. This quantum computer is not based on campus. The company described the machine as ""utility-scale"" because it's powerful enough to serve as a scientific tool and help solve problems scientists would struggle with otherwise using conventional supercomputers alone. RPI staff and students will be able to utilize the quantum computer to explore problems in chemistry, physics, material science and other fields, IBM said in the statement. ""When we describe â€œutility-scale,â€?weâ€™re specifically referring to how quantum computers can now serve as scientific tools to explore new classes of problems in chemistry, physics, materials, and other fields that are beyond the reach of brute-force classical computing techniques,"" Jamie Garcia, technical program director for algorithms & partnerships at IBM Quantum, told Live Science. Related: Error-corrected qubits 800 times more reliable after breakthrough, paving the way for 'next level' of quantum computing ""Put simply, quantum computers are now better at running quantum circuits than a classical supercomputer is at simulating them. This means, for the first time in history, quantum computers can be used as a computational tool for scientific exploration."" Get the worldâ€™s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. In June 2023 IBM scientists demonstrated the power of Eagle by using a machine fitted with the QPU to simulate the magnetic properties of a real material faster than a classical computer could. â€”World's 1st fault-tolerant quantum computer launching this year ahead of a 10,000-qubit machine in 2026 â€”World's 1st graphene semiconductor could power future quantum computers â€”How could this new type of room-temperature qubit usher in the next phase of quantum computing? Quantum computers have the potential to be far more powerful than classical computers, but only if they're scaled up and the errors in qubits are mitigated. IBM's QPUs, and others like them, employ error-correction technologies to reduce the error rate of qubits, which can be highly error-prone â€?or ""noisy."" Scientists don't expect to achieve ""quantum supremacy"" â€?in which quantum computers are more powe...",3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tech giants hatch a plan for AI job losses: Reskill 95 million in 10 years,2024-04-04T21:07:13+00:00,https://www.zdnet.com/article/tech-giants-hatch-a-plan-for-ai-job-losses-reskill-95-million-in-10-years/#ftag=RSSbaffb68,"Most Popular Some of the biggest tech companies in the world -- including those heavily invested in artificial intelligence -- have formed a consortium to address the impact of jobs lost to AI. Also: AI will have a big impact on jobs this year. Here's why that could be good news Accenture, Eightfold, Google, IBM, Indeed, Intel, Microsoft, and SAP, along with six advisers, have formed the AI-Enabled Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Workforce Consortium to help those who have lost or will lose their jobs to AI to either upskill or reskill to reenter the workforce. The consortium will help impacted workers to find training programs and connect businesses with companies looking for their skillsets. ""The mission of our newly unveiled AI-Enabled Workforce Consortium is to provide organizations with knowledge about the impact of AI on the workforce and equip workers with relevant skills,"" Cisco executive vice president and chief people, policy & purpose officer Francine Katsoudas said in a statement. It's no secret that workers around the globe are being impacted by AI adoption. Several companies, including UPS and IBM, have already acknowledged that they're laying off or freezing hiring because of AI. In total, US companies have cut more than 4,600 jobs as they seek new AI-ready hires or replace positions with AI, according to a study earlier this year from outplacement companies Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Of course, many of those cuts are driven by the AI innovations that ICT participants developed. And while consortium members acknowledged that lost jobs are a reality -- and that many jobs will be replaced entirely by AI -- they're hoping that upskilling and reskilling support will help workers find new careers in other roles. Also: These are the jobs most likely to be taken over by AI As part of that effort, the companies said their goal is to ""positively impact over 95 million individuals around the world over the next 10 years."" While that's a decidedly nebulous goal, the companies offered up some specifics: To be clear, the aforementioned goals are just that -- goals. And while it's possible the companies could meet or even exceed those numbers, it's also possible they don't. Clearly, the ICT has its work cut out for it. Also: Beyond programming: AI spawns a new generation of job roles To get there, the companies said they first plan to look at how AI has impacted 56 unidentified job roles that make up 80 percent of the top 45 job titles, based on the volume of job postings, since last year. Then they plan to make recommendations on how to move forward with ensuring workers have the requisite skills that the ICT companies are looking for to reach their lofty goals.",2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Microsoft's Copilot key for Windows 11 AI PCs has a secret - it dates back to the mid-1980s,2024-04-03T11:06:02+00:00,https://www.tweaktown.com/news/97309/microsoft-copilot-key-for-windows-11-ai-pcs-has-secret-it-dates-back-to-the-mid-1980s/index.html,"You've doubtless heard about the Copilot key - the dedicated physical key that's present on the keyboard of AI PCs running Windows 11 - but there's a surprising secret behind this new feature. The Copilot key will likely prove controversial - but you can remap it (Image Credit: Microsoft) This was highlighted by Tom's Hardware, who did some digging with new Dell XPS 14 and XPS 16 laptops that have the Copilot key on their respective keyboard decks, in an effort to find out how the key works. In other words, what's behind the Copilot key in terms of mapping, and is it a new key with a new scan code? Well, the answer to that question is a short no. The longer answer, as presented by Tom's Hardware, is that the Copilot key is actually a shortcut comprising of three keys - Left Ctrl + Windows key + F23. That was the discovery made using an open-source keyboard macro scripting tool, AutoHotkey, which also logs what keystrokes register as. Your first thought is likely to be: F23? What now? Yes, function keys these days only go up to F12 typically, but way back in the early days of PCs - we're talking about the 1980s, and IBM computers, in fact - function keys extended all the way up to F24. So, the Copilot key mapping is actually based on keyboards from the mid-80s, which is quite a bizarre turn of events. You can remap the key, mind, as Tom's outlines, using AutoHotkey (or a similar utility), and that may well be an option some folks choose to exercise - as not everyone will want a dedicated Copilot key. Not everyone wants to summon the desktop-based AI assistant at all, in fact, although there's no way to remove the functionality (not officially, anyway - although you can disable icons and the like). Copilot is a big part of the future, the way Microsoft envisages it, seeing as the dedicated key for the AI is actually part of the requirements for an AI PC - another somewhat bizarre move in our books. But one which clearly illustrates how much weight Microsoft is placing on Copilot going forward. The last dedicated key Microsoft added to the keyboard of Windows devices was, well, the Windows key itself. And that was almost 30 years ago now... Right now, the AI is quite limited in its functionality - as regards modifying Windows settings anyway - but the eventual idea is that the assistant will be capable of activating a myriad of options based off one simple request (like 'make me more productive').
